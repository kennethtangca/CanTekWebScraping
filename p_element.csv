Though it’s unclear how widespread or adamant the #NeverBiden contingent is — will they really stay home when the alternative is another four years of President Donald Trump? — the misgivings at least put the Biden campaign on notice that it has significant work to do to bring along Sanders’ base.,,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438

"The November election is almost eight months away, and unlike in 2016, Sanders’ supporters don’t have the hard feelings of superdelegates — the party bigwigs who clinched the nomination for Hillary Clinton — to overcome. This year, Sanders’ momentum was blunted not by those insiders but by black voters in the South and, following his victory in South Carolina, by the broader electorate.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438
Polls show Biden is also viewed more favorably now than Hillary Clinton was in 2016.,,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438

"Still, some Sanders supporters see the consolidation of moderate presidential candidates and other elected officials around Biden as the establishment asserting its power over the grassroots.

"“The rationale for us is that our votes need to be earned and that we’ve been taken for granted, and the party never moves to us,” said Alyson Metzger, a 54-year-old writer and progressive activist in New York City who supports Sanders. “If they install Joe Biden, I will not vote for Biden. … This is not democratic what’s happening in the Democratic primary.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438
"For Metzger, not voting for Biden is a matter of conscience. For others, it is also strategy. On “Never Biden” Facebook pages and in Twitter threads, some activists argue that if Trump is reelected, Democrats will fare better in the next midterms and that the party will be more likely to nominate a progressive in 2024. If Biden is elected, they see eight years of centrist governance.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438

"Of particular concern for Biden are young voters, including Latinos — the segments of the electorate that Sanders carried by a large margin. Evan Weber, national political director of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young climate change activists, said it is a “real possibility” that young liberals will stay home in November.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438
"While stressing that he would vote for any Democratic nominee, Weber argued, “There’s lots of narratives about why Hillary Clinton lost the election, but one undeniable one is that she did not mobilize the young people who turned out for Obama in 2012 and especially 2008. We hear a lot from pundits about Joe Biden being Obama’s vice president and him being able to recreate the Obama coalition, but one of the core and critical components of the coalition was young people.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438
"Exit polls from this year’s primaries have found a stark age divide between Sanders and Biden supporters. In Michigan, almost two-thirds of voters under 45 backed Sanders, while Biden captured a third of them. It was even more lopsided among voters under 30: 4 in 5 voted for Sanders.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438

"Recent Democratic nominees who have lost, such as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, received about 55 percent of the youth vote, he said, whereas former President Barack Obama won 60 percent or more in his two races. “It’s not a coincidence that the youth vote crossed or met that 60 percent threshold in each of those campaigns that were successful,” he said.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438
"In the 2016 primary, Sanders dominated the youth vote against Clinton, winning more than 80 percent of voters under 30 in some states.

The consequence of even a portion of Sanders’ support evaporating instead of migrating to Biden could be significant in a close election against Trump. And the urgency for Biden to win over a constituency that Sanders has carried reliably has become plain in recent days.,,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438

"When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been “arrested” in the context of the civil rights movement – even suggesting this had happened more than once – it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html

"Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html

It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods – more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors – that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"And like some of Trump’s tall tales about his past, Biden’s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” though only for “part of a summer.” This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,” adding, “I got to.” There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled “17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.)",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html

"At a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered “spending time at” and “going to” Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue’s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be “the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.”",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a “liaison” with a major adversary.,,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
Biden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation – further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.,,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"In August, the President said, “What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?” Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t “gone” – as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan “never made any sense to me” – though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said “the law doesn’t allow” Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn’t true, given the administration’s authority to grant “parole,” and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn’t permitted.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"In December, Biden said in another interview that “I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.” While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start – as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"The state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was “kind of back to what it was before the pandemic”; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody’s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth – wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody’s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase “longer-term” from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would “ease longer-term inflationary pressures” – leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Many of Biden’s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor’s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that “you’re not going to get Covid” if you’re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President’s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that “if you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in the ICU unit and you’re not going to die”; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration’s work to get Americans vaccinated – misleadingly playing down the Trump administration’s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"In February, Biden claimed that “suicides are up” amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were “over 800,000” vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"When Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn’t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies – making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"During Biden’s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html
"And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans’ new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.",,www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/fact-check-biden-false-claims-first-year-2021/index.html

"When the popular black radio host Charlamagne tha God told Joe Biden at the end of a spirited but friendly interview that he needed to come back on his show because “We got more questions,” Biden shot back:",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right

"As ridiculous as it was to say that to a black radio and TV personality who, among other things, wrote a book he calls a “self-help guide for the hood,” here’s the thing: Biden was right. He just didn’t have the right to say it.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"As a political and social liberal — who is also black — I was dismayed that anyone, black or white, voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But I was particularly appalled when I saw anyone black campaign for him. The only person I gave a pass to was Omarosa Manigault Newman — because she, at least, truly had a business reason to vote for the guy who had made her famous on “The Apprentice” and could possibly get something out of his becoming president. And she did — she landed some vague White House job that she eventually quit before writing an unflattering memoir of her brief stint there.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"I would be the last black person to suggest that black Americans are a monolithic group who all believe the same things. When it comes to electing the president of the United States, all Americans should care about voting rights, social programs, truthfulness and candor from our leaders, the environment, the meting out of justice, diversity in government offices, and the makeup of the Supreme Court. (As resilient as she is, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot live forever.) But when voting rights are subverted, the safety net is attacked, environmental regulations abandoned and income inequality widened, the repercussions hit black people hardest.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"Charlamagne was right to remind Biden on his show, “The Breakfast Club,” that Democrats take black voters for granted. That’s true. The Democratic Party has a history of assuming: Who else will black people vote for? And the Republican Party often acts as if it lost black folks from the get-go.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"When Trump declared in 2016 at a political rally that black voters should choose him, asking them what did they have to lose, what had the Democratic Party done for them? I marveled, “Nice try.” But at the same time, it was preposterous. The New York Times documented a history of racial bias decades ago at rental properties owned by Trump and his father.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"Biden and the Democratic Party are a better choice than Trump and the Republican Party. It’s as simple and sometimes depressing as that. And not voting at all is dangerous. It only ups the possibility that Trump wins. Republicans vote, they don’t stay home. Even in a quarantine.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"Race and politics are so odd. President Clinton could possibly have gotten away with saying what Biden said because he was jokingly, affectionately, referred to as the first black president. Clinton seemed to genuinely bond with black folks — a result, I think, of his Southern roots and his effortless ability to bond with everyone, black, white, man, woman, child.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"And President Obama, precisely because he is black, could never have gotten away with saying what Biden said because suddenly he would look like a flaming militant.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"Biden’s willingness to speak outside the boundaries of political correctness is refreshing. When he yelled at a Detroit auto plant worker (and this was when he was still campaigning for the Michigan primary and needed votes) and refused to placate him on gun rights — “I’m not taking your gun away at all. You need 100 rounds?”— I thought, “Fantastic.” Finally, a candidate stands up to the gun-obsessed.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right
"But Biden went too far this time. And, within hours, he had apologized, saying he should not have been so cavalier. Charlamagne didn’t miss a beat when Biden said it. “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact I want something for my community,” he told Biden.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-22/biden-says-if-youre-black-and-dont-vote-for-him-youre-not-black-hes-right

Atlanta, Georgia",,www.whitehouse.gov,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-protecting-the-right-to-vote/
"4:14 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  In our lives and the lives of our nation — the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before from everything that followed.  They stop time.  They rip away the trivial from the essential.  And they force us to confront hard truths about ourselves, about our institutions, and about our democracy.

In the words of Scripture, they remind us to “hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate.”

Last week, [Vice] President Harris and I stood in the United States Capitol to observe one of those “before and after” moments in American history: January 6th insurrection on the citadel of our democracy.

Today, we come to Atlanta — the cradle of civil rights — to make clear what must come after that dreadful day when a dagger was literally held at the throat of American democracy.

We stand on the grounds that connect Clark Atlanta — Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and near Spelman College — the home of generations of advocates, activists, educators and preachers; young people, just like the students here, who have done so much to build a better America.  (Applause.)

We visited the sacred Ebenezer Baptist Church and paused to prayed at the crypt of Dr. and Mrs. King, and spent time with their family.  And here in the district — as was pointed out — represented and reflected the life of beloved friend, John Lewis.

In their lifetimes, time stopped when a bomb blew up the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and murdered four little girls.

They [Time] stopped when John and many others seeking justice were beaten and bloodied while crossing the bridge at Selma named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

They stopped — time stopped, and they forced the country to confront the hard truths and to act — to act to keep the promise of America alive: the promise that holds that we’re all created equal but, more importantly, deserve to be treated equally.  And from those moments of darkness and despair came light and hope.

Democrats, Republicans, and independents worked to pass the historic Civil Rights Act and the voting rights legislation.  And each successive generation continued that ongoing work.

But then the violent mob of January 6th, 2021, empowered and encouraged by a defeated former president, sought to win through violence what he had lost at the ballot box, to impose the will of the mob, to overturn a free and fair election, and, for the first time — the first time in American history, they — to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

They failed.  They failed.  (Applause.)  But democracy’s — but democracy’s visi- — victory was not certain, nor is democracy’s future.

That’s why we’re here today to stand against the forces in America that value power over principle, forces that attempted a coup — a coup against the legally expressed will of the American people — by sowing doubt, inventing charges of fraud, and seeking to steal the 2020 election from the people.

They want chaos to reign.  We want the people to rule.  (Applause.)

But let me be clear: This is not about me or Vice President Harris or our party; it’s about all of us.  It’s about the people.  It’s about America.

Hear me plainly: The battle for the soul of America is not over.  We must stand strong and stand together to make sure January 6th marks not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of our democracy.  (Applause.)

You know, for the right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty.  Without it, nothing is possible, but with it, anything is possible.

But while the denial of fair and free elections is un-democratic, it is not unprecedented.

Black Americans were denied full citizenship and voting rights until 1965.  Women were denied the right to vote until just 100 years ago.  The United States Supreme Court, in recent years, has weakened the Voting Rights Act.  And now the defeated former president and his supporters use the Big Lie about the 2020 election to fuel torrent and torment and anti-voting laws — new laws designed to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections.

Here in Georgia, for years, you’ve done the hard work of democracy: registering voters, educating voters, getting voters to the polls.  You’ve built a broad coalition of voters: Black, white, Latino, Asian American, urban, suburban, rural, working class, and middle class. 

And it’s worked: You’ve changed the state by bringing more people, legally, to the polls.  (Applause.)  That’s how you won the historic elections of Senator Raphael Warnock and Senator Jon Ossoff.  (Applause.) 

You did it — you did it the right way, the democratic way.

And what’s been the reaction of Republicans in Georgia?  Choose the wrong way, the undemocratic way.  To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem.  So they’re putting up obstacles.

For example, voting by mail is a safe and convenient way to get more people to vote, so they’re making it harder for you to vote by mail. 

The same way, I might add, in the 2020 Election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House — in Florida. 

Dropping your ballots off to secure drop boxes — it’s safe, it’s convenient, and you get more people to vote.  So they’re limiting the number of drop boxes and the hours you can use them. 

Taking away the options has a predictable effect: longer lines at the polls, lines that can last for hours.  You’ve seen it with your own eyes.  People get tired and they get hungry.

When the Bible teaches us to feed the hungry and give water to the thirsty, the new Georgia law actually makes it illegal — think of this — I mean, it’s 2020, and now ’22, going into that election — it makes it illegal to bring your neighbors, your fellow voters food or water while they wait in line to vote.  What in the hell — heck are we talking about?  (Laughter and applause.)

I mean, think about it.  (Applause.)  That’s not America.  That’s what it looks like when they suppress the right to vote. 

And here’s how they plan to subvert the election: The Georgia Republican Party, the state legislature has now given itself the power to make it easier for partisan actors — their cronies — to remove local election officials. ",,www.whitehouse.gov,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-protecting-the-right-to-vote/
"Think about that.  What happened in the last election?  The former president and allies pursued, threatened, and intimidated state and local election officials.

Election workers — ordinary citizens — were subject to death threats, menacing phone calls, people stalking them in their homes.

Remember what the defeated former president said to the highest-ranking election official — a Republican — in this state?  He said, quote, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.” 

Pray God.  (Laughter.)  He didn’t say that part.  (Laughter.)

He didn’t say, “Count the votes.”  He said, “find votes” that he needed to win.

He failed because of the courageous officials — Democrats, Republicans — who did their duty and upheld the law.  (Applause.)

But with this new law in Georgia, his loyal- — his loyalists will be placed in charge of state elections.  (Laughs.)  What is that going to mean?  Well, the chances for chaos and subversion are even greater as partisans seek the result they want — no matter what the voters have said, no matter what the count.  The votes of nearly 5 million Georgians will be up for grabs if that law holds.

It’s not just here in Georgia.  Last year alone, 19 states not proposed but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights.  There were nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of state legislatures tried to pass.  And now, Republican legislators in several states have already announced plans to escalate the onslaught this year.

Their endgame?  To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion — something states can respect or ignore.

Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion.  It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote.  It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all.

It’s not hyperbole; this is a fact. 

Look, this matters to all of us.  The goal of the former president and his allies is to disenfranchise anyone who votes against them.  Simple as that.  The facts won’t matter; your vote won’t matter.  They’ll just decide what they want and then do it.

That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies. ",,www.whitehouse.gov,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-protecting-the-right-to-vote/
"We must be vigilant.

And the world is watching.  I know the majority of the world leaders — the good and the bad ones, adversaries and allies alike.  They’re watching American democracy and seeing whether we can meet this moment.  And that’s not hyperbole.

When I showed up at the G7 with seven other world leaders — there were a total of nine present — Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work — I said, “America is back.”  And the response was, “For how long?”  “For how long?” ",,www.whitehouse.gov,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/01/11/remarks-by-president-biden-on-protecting-the-right-to-vote/
"As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.

Over the past year, we’ve directed federal agencies to promote access to voting, led by the Vice President.  We’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff.

And today, we call on Congress to get done what history will judge: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)  Pass it now — (applause) — which would prevent voter suppression so that here in Georgia there’s full access to voting by mail, there are enough drop boxes during enough hours so that you can bring food and water as well to people waiting in line. 

The Freedom to Vote Act takes on election subversion to protect nonpartisan electors [election] officials, who are doing their job, from intimidation and interference.

It would get dark money out of politics, create fairer district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering.  (Applause.)

Look, it’s also time to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  (Applause.) 

I’ve been having these quiet conversations with the members of Congress for the last two months.  I’m tired of being quiet!  (Applause.)

Folks, it’ll restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act of ’65 — the one President Johnson signed after John Lewis was beaten, nearly killed on Bloody Sunday, only to have the Supreme Court weaken it multiple times over the past decade.

Restoring the Voting Rights Act would mean the Justice Department can stop discriminatory laws before they go into effect — before they go into effect.  (Applause.) 
The Vice President and I have supported voting rights bills since day one of this administration.  But each and every time, Senate Republicans have blocked the way.  Republicans oppose even debating the issue.  You hear me?

I’ve been around the Senate a long time.  I was Vice President for eight years.  I’ve never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice that’s ready to speak for justice now.

When I was a senator, including when I headed up the Judiciary Committee, I helped reauthorize the Voting [Rights] Act three times.  We held hearings.  We debated.  We voted.  I was able to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years.

In 2006, the Voting Rights Act passed 390 to 33 in
the House of Representatives and 98 to 0 in the Senate with votes from 16 current sitting Republicans in this United States Senate.  Sixteen of them voted to extend it.

The last year I was chairman, as some of my friends sitting down here will tell you, Strom Thurmond voted to extend the Voting Rights Act.  Strom Thurmond.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wow.

THE PRESIDENT:   You can say that again: “Wow.”  You have no idea how damn ha- — how darn hard I worked on that one.  (Laughter and applause.)

But, folks, then it was signed into law, the last time, by President George W. Bush.

You know, when we got voting rights extended in the 1980s, as I’ve said, even Thurmond supported it.  Think about that.  The man who led the longest filibu- — one of the longest filibusters in history in the United States Senate in 1957 against the Voting Rights Act [Civil Rights Act].  The man who led and sided with the old Southern Bulls in the United States Senate to perpetuate segregation in this nation.  Even Strom Thurmond came to support voting rights.

But Republicans today can’t and won’t.  Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America’s right to vote.  Not one.  Not one.

We have 50-50 in the United States Senate.  That means we have 51 presidents.  (Laughter.)  You all think I’m kidding.  (Laughter.)

I’ve been pretty good at working with senators my whole career.  But, man, when you got 51 presidents, it gets harder.  Any one can change the outcome.

Sadly, the United States Senate — designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body — has been rendered a shell of its former self.  It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honored to serve in the Senate.

But as an institutionalist, I believe that the threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them, vote. 

Let the majority prevail.  (Applause.)  And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.  (Applause.)

You know, last year, if I’m not mistaken, the filibuster was used 154 times.  The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past and promote some bipartisanship.  But it’s also been used to obstruct — including and especially obstruct civil rights and voting rights.

And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desks for however long it took, and sometimes it took hours.  And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended.

But that doesn’t happen today.  Senators no longer even have to speak one word.  The filibuster is not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart.

The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.

While the state legislatures’ assault on voting rights is simple — all you need in your House and Senate is a pure majority — in the United States Senate, it takes a supermajority: 60 votes, even to get a vote — instead of 50 — to protect the right to vote.

State legislatures can pass anti-voting laws with simple majorities.  If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights by a simple majority.  (Applause.)

Today I’m making it clear: To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed — (applause) — to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights.  (Applause.)  

When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate.  

I make this announcement with careful deliberation, recognizing the fundamental right to vote is the right from which all other rights flow.

And I make it with an appeal to my Republican colleagues, to those Republicans who believe in the rule of law: Restore the bipartisan tradition of voting rights. 

The people who restored it, who abided by it in the past were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush.  They all supported the Voting Rights Act.

Don’t let the Republican Party morph into something else.  Restore the institution of the Senate the way it was designed to be.

Senate rules were just changed to raise the debt ceiling so we wouldn’t renege on our debt for the first time in our history and prevent an economic crisis.  That was done by a simple majority.

As Senator Warnock said a few weeks ago in a powerful speech: If we change the rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, we should be able to change the rules to protect the heart and soul of our democracy.  (Applause.)  He was right.

In the days that followed John Lewis’s death, there was an outpouring of praise and support across the political spectrum.

But as we stand here today, it isn’t enough just to praise his memory.  We must translate eulogy into action.  We need to follow John Lewis’s footsteps.  We need to support the bill in his name.

Just a few days ago, we talked about — up in the Congress and in the White House — the event coming up shortly to celebrate Dr. King’s birthday.  And Americans of all stripes will praise him for the content of his character.

But as Dr. King’s family said before, it’s not enough to praise their father.  They even said: On this holiday, don’t celebrate his birthday unless you’re willing to support what he lived for and what he died for.  (Applause.)

The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation’s history.

We will choose — the issue is: Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadows, justice over injustice? 

I know where I stand.  I will not yield.  I will not flinch.  I will defend the right to vote, our democracy against all enemies — foreign and, yes, domestic.  (Applause.)

And the question is: Where will the institution of the United States Senate stand?  Every senator — Democrat, Republican, and independent — will have to declare where they stand, not just for the moment, but for the ages.

Will you stand against voter suppression?  Yes or no?  That’s the question they’ll answer.  Will you stand against election subversion?  Yes or no?  Will you stand for democracy?  Yes or no?

And here’s one thing every senator and every American should remember: History has never been kind to those who have sided with voter suppression over voters’ rights.  And it will be even less kind for those who side with election subversion.

So, I ask every elected official in America: How do you want to be remembered? 

At consequential moments in history, they present a choice: Do you want to be the si- — on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?

This is the moment to decide to defend our elections, to defend our democracy.  (Applause.)

And if you do that, you will not be alone.  That’s because the struggle to protect voting rights has never been borne by one group alone.

We saw Freedom Riders of every race.  Leaders of every faith marching arm in arm.  And, yes, Democrats and Republicans in Congress of the United States and in the presidency.

I did not live the struggle of Douglass, Tubman, King, Lewis, Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, and countless others — known and unknown.

I did not walk in the shoes of generations of students who walked these grounds.  But I walked other grounds.  Because I’m so damn old, I was there as well.  (Laughter.)

You think I’m kidding, man.  (Laughter.)  It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested.  Anyway — (laughter).

But their struggles here — they were the ones that opened my eyes as a high school student in the late — in the late ’50s and early ’60s.  They got me more engaged in the work of my life.

And what we’re talking about today is rooted in the very idea of America — the idea that Annell Ponder, who graduated
from Clark Atlanta, captured in a single word.  She was a teacher and librarian who was also an unyielding champion of voting rights.

In 1963 — when I was just starting college at university — after registering voters in Mississippi, she was pulled off a bus, arrested, and jailed, where she was brutally beaten.

In her cell, next to her, was Fannie Lou Hamer, who described the beating this way, and I quote: “I could hear the sounds of [the] licks and [the] horrible screams…They beat her, I don’t know [for] how long.  And after a while, she began to pray, and asked God to have mercy on those people.”

Annell Ponder’s friends visited her the next day.  Her face was badly swollen.  She could hardly talk.

But she managed to whi- — whisper one word: “Freedom.”  “Freedom” — the only word she whispered.

After nearly 250 years since our founding, that singular idea still echoes.  But it’s up to all of us to make sure it never fades, especially the students here — your generation that just started voting — as there are those who are trying to take away that vi- — vote you just started to be able to exercise. 

But the giants we honor today were your age when they made clear who we must be as a nation.  Not a joke.  Think about it.  In the early ’60s, they were sitting where you’re sitting.  They were you.  And like them, you give me much hope for the future.

Before and after in our lives — and in the life of the nation — democracy is who we are, who we must be — now and forever.  So, let’s stand in this breach together.  Let’s love good, establish justice in the gate. 

And remember, as I said, there is one — this is one of those defining moments in American history: Each of those who vote will be remembered by class after class, in the ’50s and ’60s — the 2050s and ’60s.  Each one of the members of the Senate is going to be judged by history on where they stood before the vote and where they stood after the vote. 

There’s no escape.  So, let’s get back to work. 

As my fath- — my grandfather Finnegan used to say every time I walked out the door in Scranton, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.”  Then he’d say, “No, Joey, spread it.” 

Let’s spread the faith and get this done.  (Applause.) 

May God bless you all.  And may God protect the sacred right to vote.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I mean it.  Let’s go get this done.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

"President Joe Biden pauses as a protester interrupts him at an event on the campus of George Mason University in Manassas, Va., on Jan. 23, 2024.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"The media narrative is grim for president Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats: Biden's too old and his mental acuity is questionable, sayeth the pundits and the polls. Democratic base voters, particularly Black voters, are disenchanted with the president, leading a generally cranky Democratic rank-and-file to stay home this November.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"Actual elections, however, paint a much different picture. Democrats scored a big win in New York on Tuesday, and the numbers were extremely encouraging for the party. Not only did Democrats add a seat to their caucus in Washington, but it wasn't even close: Tom Suozzi, a former House member who reclaimed his old job, beat Republican Mazi Pilip by 8 percentage points – a 16-point swing from 15 months ago, when former GOP Rep. George Santos took the district by 8 percentage points.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

"""Polls don't vote. People vote. And that's what's been happening,"" says Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, a veteran lawmaker from Massachusetts who has served in both the minority and the majority. Despite what the polls say, ""people have been voting, and they've been voting Democratic. I feel really good about November – and not just about the president. I feel really good about us taking back the House.""",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"Experts caution that a special election win in New York – particularly a district Biden won in 2020, albeit when the district was drawn to be more Democratic-friendly – does not a national movement make. The president still has abysmally low approval ratings, and national and battleground state polls show him in a tight race with his likely fall opponent, former President Donald Trump.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

"In a 2022 election season when Democrats did surprisingly well, they fared poorly in blue New York, Reeher notes, losing four congressional seats to Republicans. Tuesday's special election could just be the state returning to its mostly Democratic roots, he says.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"And the immigration issue – which Democrats are trying to seize as their own, focusing on House Republicans' refusal to consider a bipartisan border security package negotiated by the Senate – remains a vulnerability for both Biden and congressional Democrats.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
But the numbers that matter – performances in contests ranging from mayoral and state legislative races to presidential primaries – give still-nervous Democrats reason to hope.,,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"In the past year, Republicans lost the mayoral races in both ruby-red Colorado Springs, Colorado (where an independent newcomer, Yemi Mobolade, became the city's first Black mayor), and in Jacksonville, Florida, where Democrat Donna Deegan's win erased Jacksonville's distinction as the largest U.S. city with a Republican mayor.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

"In November, Democrats flipped the Virginia state House, gained seats in the New Jersey state legislature, held onto the governorship in deep red Kentucky, and won city council and school board races across the country. Last month, Democrats picked up a critical state House seat in Orlando, Florida – an important indicator of political mood in the I-4 corridor, home to many Hispanics.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"Nationally, Democrats are outpacing Republicans in voter registration, going from trailing the GOP in September (28% Republican registration and 24% Democratic registration) to leading in January (27% Democratic registration versus 25% Republican registration), according to Gallup.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"Tuesday was a big night for Democrats as well. Not only did Suozzi shrink the GOP's already whisper-thin majority in the House with his win in New York, but Democrat Jim Prokopiak ensured Democratic control of Pennsylvania’s state House with a blowout 68%-32% win over Republican Candace Cabanas in a race predicted to be much closer. The win was the sixth special election victory for Democrats in Pennsylvania, allowing them to retain control of a chamber they flipped in 2022.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

"That doesn't necessarily translate into support for Biden, experts note, since the president often polls lower than Democrats running for lower office. In the New York 3rd District race Suozzi won this week, for example, a Siena College poll taken the week before the election had Suozzi 4 percentage points ahead but Trump beating Biden by 5 percentage points.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

"Biden won the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate, garnering 64% of the vote without having campaigned or advertised in the state because of Democratic National Committee rules.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"In South Carolina, Biden's win with 96% of the vote was not unexpected. But after a slew of polls showing Black voters are unenthusiastic about Biden, the Palmetto State – which propelled Biden to the nomination in 2020 – indicated otherwise. Black voters, who comprised 56% of the early vote in the 2020 primary, made up 76% of that vote this year, the Biden campaign said.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box
"In Nevada, both Biden and Trump had only nominal opposition in their respective contests (a primary for Biden and caucuses for Trump), but Biden got nearly twice as many votes as did Trump – who wrongly claimed the turnout for the GOP caucuses was a record. While caucuses do tend to have lower turnouts than primaries, the difference was stark.",,www.usnews.com,https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2024-02-16/democrats-are-trailing-everywhere-but-at-the-ballot-box

Democrats are raising concerns that President Biden’s standing among young voters is in jeopardy after polling released this week showed Biden effectively tied with former President Trump among young voters. ,,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"A New York Times/Siena College survey released Monday showed Biden virtually tied with Trump among voters younger than 30, with 30 percent backing Biden and 29 percent backing Trump. Thirty-four percent said they backed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"Meanwhile, an Emerson College poll released last month found 45 percent of voters younger than 30 backing Trump, while 43 percent said they supported Biden.",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"The latest data is surprising, given Biden’s victory over Trump among young voters in 2020. According to AP VoteCast, Biden won 61 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29.",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“Young people as we know have always been fiercely independent,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. “It’s a more cynical electorate with God knows how many more independent candidacies, which on the youth cohort are more likely to hurt Biden more than Trump.”  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
The polling comes as Biden has faced backlash among young voters and activists for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.  ,,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"Earlier this week, several progressive groups, including March for Our Lives, GenZ For Change, and the Sunrise Movement, penned an open letter to Biden, warning his handling of the Israel-Hamas War could depress turnout among Millennial and Generation Z voters come next year.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“We write to you to issue a very stark and unmistakable warning: you and your Administration’s stance on Gaza risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year,” the letter read.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reiterated the same sentiment in an interview on CNN.  ,,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“The primary concern for everybody is the status of Palestinians and the human rights, as well as Israelis too, the safety in the region,” Ocasio-Cortez told the network. “So I try not to look at this through an electoral lens but through what the right thing to do is. But I think it’s certainly something that is, that should be top of mind when it comes to the Democratic coalition.” ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"When asked about the latest polling showing Biden seemingly in a slump with young voters, however, Democrats point to what they see as the pivotal role young voters played in Tuesday’s off-year elections.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“If you want to see how people are going to vote, look at how they are voting,” said Jack Lobel, spokesperson for the Gen Z group Voters of Tomorrow. “On Tuesday, we saw young voters turn out in Virginia and in Ohio and in Kentucky and vote for President Biden’s ideology.”  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
Democrats also say polls and predictions have missed the mark on young voter turnout in the past.  ,,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“The polls for the last several years on young voters have missed the mark every single time. We just had an election, and we were told right before the election that young people were probably not going to vote as overwhelmingly Democratic or turn out at the rates they did,” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the youth voting organization NextGen America.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“We’re not riding the pollercoaster,” she continued. “We’re doing the hard organizing work to make sure that young voters turnout and young voters are overwhelmingly progressive.”  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“I don’t think this poll is reflective of the political reality that has played out every single election post-2016,” she added. ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"Ramirez pointed to top motivators for young Democratic-leaning voters, including climate change, student debt relief and a Trump candidacy.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“In 2020, Joe Biden was not the youth vote candidate, it’s true,” she said. “But what we saw is that young people did turn out and vote for him overwhelmingly, and they did it also in repudiation of Donald Trump and also for progressive policy.” ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"And Democrats are quick to note the recent poll numbers are not about Trump gaining ground with young voters, but rather Biden losing ground. ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“I think it’s that Biden has taken a big hit with younger voters and is just not top of mind and I think that there is a restlessness that’s sort of playing. But I do not think that this is a move toward Trump by young voters by any stretch of the imagination,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"Reinish predicted young voters will ultimately choose Biden over Trump again, assuming Trump gets the nomination, pointing to their stances on climate change, abortion and democracy.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
Della Volpe said it was critical for the Biden administration and campaign to continue to communicate their stances and accomplishments on these issues in an effort to win young voters over.  ,,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“It’s going to be important for members of the Biden-Harris team to constantly communicate the positive change in the country based upon youth participation,” he said, citing issues like climate investments, diversity in government and bipartisan gun legislation.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"Still, Biden has faced questions over his age and whether that will ultimately be a factor in voter enthusiasm for his campaign.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"An AP-NORC poll released in August found that 77 percent of voters younger than 45 said they thought Biden was too old to serve as president effectively. Among Democrats aged 18 to 29 years old, 76 percent said they believed Biden was too old to run for president.  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"However, Democratic activists argued it is Biden’s ideology rather than age that will be the biggest factor. ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“President Biden being 80 years old does not matter to me how I live my life,” said Lobel, who is 19 and voting in his first presidential election next year. “Him investing in my education, in my future as a person who’s going to inherit this world, this economy, this climate, this matters to me.”  ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/
"“As a 19-year-old, these are the numbers I care about, not his age,” he said. ",,thehill.com,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4304919-biden-loses-ground-with-young-voters-prompting-dem-concerns/

"“I don’t think there’s a risk that any substantial number of them would go over and vote for Donald Trump, but I do think there’s a real risk that they won’t be energized and that they’ll stay home,” said Tom Bonier, a longtime Democratic political strategist and senior adviser to TargetSmart polling firm.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"In the 2020 election, young voter turnout was a record 50 percent nationally, a sharp 11-percentage-point increase from 2016, according to Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. That turnout topped 50 percent in many of the key swing states that delivered the election to Biden, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"“When you consider the role that young voters played in Biden’s victory three years ago, it’s going to be really important for him and his coalition to be able to energize young voters and get them out to vote,” Bonier said.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"The climate voters are the most motivated. Seventy-two percent of those who ranked climate policy as their top issue said they were likely to vote, according to the survey. That same group was 37 percent more likely to say they would vote Democratic.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
But there are still many climate-minded voters who would need to be convinced that they should vote for Biden.,,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"The Tufts survey found a significant number of young people are worried about climate change and believe political leaders have done nothing to address it, said Sara Suzuki, a senior researcher at Tufts. The vast majority have heard nothing from any campaign. Overall, only about 1 in 5 young people surveyed had heard from any campaign.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"This year, the administration will roll out major new climate rules and regulations that will limit planet-warming emissions from power plants and vehicles, implement new fees on methane emissions, and impose more stringent requirements on the fossil fuel industry to calculate its greenhouse gas pollution. Under Biden, EPA has also sharply increased its estimate for the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions, which can help federal agencies justify stricter climate rules.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"And yet, many Americans are unaware of Biden’s efforts, let alone his landmark climate law. A majority of Americans, or 58 percent, have only heard a “little” about the Inflation Reduction Act, a Yale University survey released last month showed.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"That’s because Biden has also overseen record levels of oil and gas production. The U.S. is now producing a daily average of about 13.2 million barrels of crude oil, up from a peak of 13 million under Trump and more than the next two top-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"Some fossil fuel projects advanced by the administration, especially Alaska’s Willow project and Mountain Valley pipeline in West Virginia, are also targets of viral TikTok videos, alienating at least some segments of young voters.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"Despite those challenges, the Biden campaign is preparing to use climate policy as one of the sharpest contrasts with Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris will be a key part of that outreach, White House officials say.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"Biden and Harris will spend the year “laying out the dire stakes of this election so they can secure reelection and continue to advance the essential work of creating clean energy jobs and leading the world toward a more sustainable future,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"Harris will continue last year’s strategy of talking about climate policy with college audiences and social media influencers, while also attending groundbreakings for clean energy projects around the country. She is also expected to focus her speeches on climate — even during unrelated events. During a visit last week to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, for example, Harris talked about the importance of improving air quality for local front-line communities.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"“I think you’ll see on the youth engagement part a continued effort for the vice president to go to where young people are, use platforms young people use and speak in a way that is resonant to young folks,” said Ike Irby, special assistant to the president and deputy domestic policy adviser to the vice president.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/
"The White House and its allies are now running a nationwide education campaign on Biden’s climate policies and the work that still needs to be done in a second term. That includes an $80 million effort from Climate Power, a communications organization that is partnering with super political action committee Future Forward to rally voters in the key swing states expected to decide the election.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"Many young people want Biden to do more on climate, but also recognize that they “have a seat at the table” with him, whereas Trump has ignored their concerns, said Jack Lobel, the group’s spokesperson and a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia University.",,www.eenews.net,https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-needs-young-voters-can-his-climate-policy-rally-them/

"Twenty-one Democratic candidates will appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, but incumbent President Joe Biden isn’t one of them.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why

Why? It’s all about a change to the Democratic National Committee’s rules that made South Carolina — not New Hampshire — the first official primary of the Democratic presidential nominating cycle.,,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Because the New Hampshire primary is “non-compliant” with new DNC rules, the national party deemed the contest “meaningless.” The winner next Tuesday will be in name only, walking away with no delegates to the convention in August.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"New Hampshire leaders – both Republicans and Democrats – were not pleased, banding together to uphold state law that requires its voters to have the first primary New Hampshire Attorney General Brendan O’Donnell filed his own cease-and-desist letter accusing the DNC of engaging in voter suppression.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"“This is the election,” said New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, who oversees the state’s election process. “There is no other election taking place in New Hampshire where delegates are going to be awarded to the convention. So whether the Democratic National Committee decides to recognize those delegates or not, that’s on them.”",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why

"The DNC instructed candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate” in the New Hampshire primary as currently scheduled. Two high-profile Democratic challengers ignored the DNC: Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, an author making her second run for the nomination. Biden chose to skip the state altogether.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"“It’s really unfortunate and sad that the president of the United States chose not to be on the New Hampshire ballot,” Scanlan told the NewsHour. “The decision not to do that comes across as petty, but New Hampshire is moving forward with or without him.”",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why

"It’s a grassroots and mostly volunteer campaign led by the president’s supporters in New Hampshire, and it’s running on a shoestring budget. Organizers hope to recruit thousands of volunteers to stand outside every voting location in the state to tell people how to write-in the president’s name on the ballot. Since the effort launched last fall, a super PAC has also joined the effort, spending about $1.25 million so far on direct mailings and advertising.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why

"While high-profile Democrats in and out of the state are vocally supportive of the write-in effort, it is unaffiliated with Biden’s official reelection campaign. The goal is simply to get Joe Biden a victory, and organizers are lowering expectations for what a victory looks like. One Democrat connected to the super PAC told the NewsHour a win is getting just one more vote than the candidate in second place.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
Write-in campaigns can be a logistical nightmare that require a lot of voter education. The president’s supporters have to explain to voters to look all the way at the bottom of the ballot — skipping the long list of Democratic candidates — to fill in a bubble and write the president’s name.,,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Organizers say one thing is to their advantage: “Joe Biden” is an easy name to spell. They take comfort in the successful 2010 write-in campaign of Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, which required significant ad spending to teach voters how to spell her name. Plus, New Hampshire’s secretary of state is expected to allow misspellings to count if the voter’s intent is clear.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Recent polling suggests that despite the challenges of a write-in campaign, Biden has a comfortable lead over the 21 candidates whose names are actually on the ballot. More than three-quarters of Democratic voters have decided who they will vote for, and 69 percent plan on writing in Biden’s name, according to a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll. That’s far ahead of Phillips and Williamson, who have 7 and 6 percent respectively. (In March 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last incumbent to run as a write-in candidate in New Hampshire, won a narrow 7-point victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy before dropping out of the race later that month.)",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Phillips entered the campaign in late October and has been trying to grow his name recognition in the months since, recently running his first ads in New Hampshire. While his advisers at one time suggested he could win more than 40 percent of the vote, Phillips recently told Politico that finishing around 20 percent “would be magnificent.” He also suggested that getting anything less than 60 percent of the vote should be troubling to the incumbent.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"The eventual winner of the Democratic primary will have a lot to do with voter turnout on Tuesday. With an incumbent running without major competition, the secretary of state would usually expect lower turnout in the Democratic race, but the write-in campaign is complicating his turnout projections. Scanlan estimated Friday that voter turnout would be about 410,000 voters, just less than half of registered voters in the state. Expected turnout for Republicans was close to four times that of Democrats, according to his projections.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Nearly 40 percent of the state’s voters are unaffiliated with a political party and can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. That includes around 4,000 Democrats who switched their voter registration to undeclared ahead of the October deadline. Many intend to vote in the Republican primary.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"“The energy and the enthusiasm and the interest is clearly on the Republican side because of the number of candidates who are engaged in that race,” Scanlan said.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Thalia Floras, a lifelong New Hampshire resident, changed her party registration for the first time ever ahead of this election, from Democrat to undeclared. She has grown weary about Biden’s age and thinks he should not have run for a second term. But because her vote in the Democratic primary for either Williamson or Phillips (“both great candidates,” she said) would not count toward their delegate totals, she’s planning to vote for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Republican primary instead.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"“I want to boost the candidate that not only could have a chance to beat Donald Trump but that I can respect as my president,” she said.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
Floras and her friend Hella Ross went to dozens of town hall meetings to hear from the candidates directly and learn about their positions.,,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Ross, another lifelong Democrat, was also hoping to vote in the Democratic primary and said she would support either Phillips or Williamson as the nominee.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"“This particular election is calling for desperate measures,” she said. Like her friend, she plans to vote for Haley, who she believes is “best positioned right now to defeat Trump.”",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"The prospect of Democrats staying home or undeclared voters choosing a Republican ballot is just one of the complicated calculations ahead of election day next week. A Democratic primary with potentially a large number of write-in votes will complicate counting, too.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"Many smaller towns in the state hand count all of their ballots. Larger cities will have machines that separate out the write-in ballots that will then be counted by hand. Local election officials have been recruiting extra volunteers to help with the counting, which will continue on primary night until every vote is counted.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why
"That won’t be unusually late, the secretary of state said. Despite the hand count, there is just one race on the ballot, which Scanlan said will simplify the process. He expects most of the results to be reported by 10 p.m. local time, just two hours after the last polls close.",,www.pbs.org,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-isnt-on-the-ballot-in-new-hampshires-primary-heres-why

"The adviser argued that public acknowledgment of that reality could help Biden mollify younger voters, especially on the left, who are unexcited by his candidacy and fear that his nomination would serve as an eight-year roadblock to the next generation of Democrats.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"By signaling that he will serve just one term and choosing a running mate and Cabinet that is young and diverse, Biden could offer himself to the Democratic primary electorate as the candidate best suited to defeat Trump as well as the candidate who can usher into power the party’s fresh faces.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"“This makes Biden a good transition figure,” the adviser said. “I’d love to have an election this year for the next generation of leaders, but if I have to wait four years [in order to] to get rid of Trump, I’m willing to do it.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"Another top Biden adviser put it this way: “He’s going into this thinking, ‘I want to find a running mate I can turn things over to after four years but if that’s not possible or doesn’t happen then I’ll run for reelection.’ But he’s not going to publicly make a one term pledge.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

Biden adviser,,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"Since Thanksgiving there has been a gradual shift among prominent Democrats once deeply skeptical of Biden’s candidacy. In national polls, Elizabeth Warren, who was on a trajectory to topple Biden, has lost all the gains she achieved since July and fallen to third place. Pete Buttigieg, who has replaced Warren as the hot candidate among white college-educated voters, has shown no evidence that, even as he thrills a subset of the Democratic electorate in Iowa, he can achieve broad appeal among African American and Latino voters. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won 43 percent of the primary vote in 2016, has been unable to break out of the mid-teens for most of this year.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"Biden’s base of older working-class white and African American voters has been unassailable. A year of national polling of the Democratic primary shows his remarkably consistent support. According to the Real Clear Politics national polling average on Dec. 8, 2018, Biden had 29 percent support nationally. On Dec. 8, 2019, he had 29 percent support.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"The greatest threats to Biden’s African American base have been neutralized. Sen. Kamala Harris has suspended her campaign. Sen. Cory Booker has struggled to qualify for the PBS NewsHour/POLITICO Debate, on Dec. 19. Former Gov. Deval Patrick, a pre-Thanksgiving entrant to the race, has barely been heard from and is polling at less than 1 percent.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"This current bright spot could just be some momentary sunshine for Biden before storm clouds gather. Biden’s position in Iowa and New Hampshire, overwhelmingly white states packed with college-educated Democrats unexcited by his candidacy, is middling. Poor showings in both states could upend the race. Warren, who has built a robust national campaign and is generally seen by Biden’s advisers as the strongest primary opponent remaining, could still make a comeback. Biden has struggled with fundraising, while all three of his top opponents — Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg — have demonstrated the potential to fund a long campaign against him. Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire who has quietly bought himself into fifth place by spending tens of millions of dollars on television ads, looms as a potential Super Tuesday threat on March 3, after the first four states have voted.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

"And so the question of how to address Biden’s age, which may be the candidate’s most significant liability, and the related question of the lack of enthusiasm for Biden’s candidacy among the activist wing of their party, has once again seized Democrats.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

"In April, when asked whether he would serve just one term, Biden responded, “No.” More recently, Biden has been ambiguous. In October, The Associated Press reported that when “asked whether he would pledge to only serve one term if elected, Biden said he wouldn’t make such a promise but noted he wasn’t necessarily committed to seeking a second term if elected in 2020.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

"Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director and deputy campaign manager, declined to comment when asked whether Biden had ruled out running for reelection if he wins the Democratic nomination and defeats Trump.

"Several advisers downplayed the idea of a formal pledge. Others emphasized that there were better ways to address concerns about Biden’s age, such as using his age as a proxy for experience. (Biden recently challenged a voter to an IQ test or push-up competition.) But the issue remains a topic of debate inside and outside the campaign, and several advisers now quietly acknowledge that while Biden won’t run for reelection he cannot say so publicly.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
But the case for going public has some advocates.,,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"A political strategist who has recently talked to one of Biden’s closest advisers made the argument for serving one term this way: “Is 81 years old too old to be president? Yes. Is an eighty-one year-old president standing for reelection likely to be successful? He is not. And is it the right thing to do for the country? No. Biden wouldn’t be running if it were President Jeb Bush or President Marco Rubio. He’s running because it’s an exigent circumstance — Donald Trump. The next president will have to have oppositional virtues to the last president. We have a presidency that is defined by abject selfishness, self-regard and self-interest. So a one-term pledge would be viewed as an act of selflessness, putting the country ahead of any ambition.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"One adviser to Biden who favors a one-term pledge argued that if he wins and his presidency is a success, and he’s healthy enough to run for reelection he could always reverse the pledge if Democrats wanted him to remain their candidate in 2024.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"But many prominent Democrats believe a public pledge to serve only one term would do more harm than good, a conclusion also reached by Republican advisers to John McCain in 2008, when the then-72-year-old GOP nominee considered making such a commitment.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"“That’s a weak play,” said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman. “I think who his vice president is will be very important because people will be thinking about that. But I don’t think I would make a one-term pledge. You’ve disempowered yourself as president, and I don’t think it helps you as a candidate. It accentuates your weakness. It doesn’t fix it.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"That’s why the campaign’s current course of strategic ambiguity may be the best approach for Biden right now, key advisers believe. It keeps the issue alive without ruling out a more formal pledge later on. If Biden’s fortunes decline and the pledge makes more political sense it can always be revived. Alternatively, if being seen as a one-termer weakens him in the primary or general election, he can say unequivocally that he will seek reelection.",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129
"“I think he should make [the one-term pledge] privately to himself and his wife and no one else,” said one well-known Democratic strategist. “You can’t let the cat out of the bag. Go back to that old Jimmy Breslin essay on power — you know it’s a lot of smoke and mirrors. If you begin your first day as president as a lame duck, it changes everything. Every Cabinet secretary, every subcommittee chairman treats you differently. I wouldn’t advise it, just from a governing perspective as well as political.”",,www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/11/biden-single-term-082129

Welcome to 538’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.,,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"tia.yang (Tia Yang, editor/reporter): It’s Thanksgiving week, and the presidential turkeys have already been pardoned. Liberty and Bell, this year’s lucky birds from Minnesota, are surely thankful to be heading back home this holiday season. And with most politicians doing the same, here at 538, we thought we’d chat about what we think some of them might be feeling thankful for.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"We’ll start at the top with President Joe Biden, who just turned 81 on Monday. Maybe his birthday wish was for some better polling heading into 2024. But what does the president have to be thankful for this Thanksgiving?",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948

His average approval rating has fallen below 40 percent in 538's tracker. There's a lot of dissatisfaction among his base about his handling of issues like the economy and the war in Israel-Gaza. And he trails former President Donald Trump in most general-election polls.,,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"leah.askarinam: Right. Recent polls have yielded some bad news for Biden — for example, his approval rating declined to his lowest ever in the latest NBC poll, which is widely respected among politicos. But even more interesting to me was how NBC summed up a slew of other record-breaking bad numbers that poll included for Biden. For example, it's the first time the poll found Biden behind Trump in a hypothetical general-election matchup. And one of the pollsters, Republican Bill McInturff, told NBC that the impact the Israel-Hamas war has had was unprecedented, because foreign affairs don't usually hit American presidents quite this hard.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"Perhaps Biden could be thankful that outlier polls exist and could potentially account for some of the bad numbers, although it seems unlikely given recent trends.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"nrakich: Yeah. But I think your first point is absolutely right, Leah — Biden can be thankful that this is November 2023, not November 2024. I'm skeptical that the Israel-Hamas war is going to stay in the headlines long enough to be one of the deciding issues of the 2024 general election.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
It's a long campaign. We're in a bad news cycle for Biden right now. But there is time for several more news cycles to come and go before Election Day.,,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"Including some news cycles that will probably be bad for Trump! And that's what I think Biden should be thankful for: the fact that he is very likely going to be running against Trump, who is almost as unpopular as he is, who may very well be convicted of multiple crimes in the next year, and who has a unique ability to energize the Democratic base.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"If you think the polls are bad for Biden against Trump, take a look at his polls against former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. A Fox News poll that put Biden 4 points behind Trump nationally put him 11 points behind Haley. A Marquette Law School poll that put Biden 2 points behind Trump nationally (among likely voters) put him 12 points behind Haley.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"Now, I don't think Haley would win by that much (no one has won the popular vote by more than 9 points since 1984). But I think if Republicans nominated anyone but Trump, they would be favorites to win back the White House in 2024.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"tia.yang: Plus the fact that Biden’s silver lining is that he’s running against someone almost as unpopular as he is only underlines the fact that he's less popular than Trump. Heading into the 2020 election, Trump was nearly as unpopular as he is now, but Biden's favorability was in positive territory. Now Biden is the unpopular incumbent. That could be bad news for him when it comes to turning out his base.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"leah.askarinam: Right, they're both quite unpopular. But I still think Trump has a harder ceiling than Biden, and the biggest threat to a Biden victory is voters staying at home or voting third-party.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"But to that point, I'd add to Biden's list of things to be thankful for that the off-year elections indicate that voters are still responding to messaging on protecting abortion rights. A new Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found a record-breaking share of Americans — 55 percent — say women should be able to get an abortion for any reason.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948

"Let's move on to the other side of the horse race. Nathaniel, what do you think Trump's feeling thankful for?",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948

"The same things I said above for Biden go for Trump too: If Democrats had a younger, less unpopular nominee like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Sen. Raphael Warnock, Trump would be a serious underdog. But instead, Trump will probably run against one of the only politicians in America who’s more unpopular than he is.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"leah.askarinam: I think there's a slight unknown there though, Nathaniel. We know that Biden versus Trump is basically a dead heat at this point, because Biden's weaknesses are, theoretically, manageable for Democrats. He can still run on abortion rights and preserving democracy, even if voters think that as a human being he is simply too old to be president. He won't win a landslide, but he can certainly win the presidency anyway.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948
"To compare this to Biden’s odds against a more popular Republican, the only reason we know Haley fares well on a national stage is because ... she is running for president and is faring decently on a national stage.

"tia.yang: Right. While Haley's polling looks good in a theoretical matchup against Biden, it's not looking so good against Trump.

"nrakich: Yeah, my alternative answer was going to be that Trump should be thankful that Republican voters are still so loyal to him, even after he lost in 2020. Historically, parties usually want nothing to do with their losing presidential nominees — Democrats moved on quickly from Hillary Clinton after 2016, Republicans from Mitt Romney after 2012. But not Trump after 2020.",,abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948

"Let’s pivot to the legislative branch. In the wake of a House speakership crisis and amid a looming government shutdown, public approval for Congress has been as low as 13 percent in recent polls — 538’s approval tracker had it at its lowest point all year at the end of October. But after 10 straight weeks in session, Speaker Mike Johnson’s House managed to avoid (or at least delay) a holiday season shutdown by punting the next federal funding deadline to January.

"In order to keep the government open, Johnson had to compromise with Democrats and pass a continuing resolution. In other words, he had to do exactly what former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did.

This is the first time in over a decade (since 2012) that Congress doesn’t have at least one government funding deadline in the month of December.

"DONALD TRUMP ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system’s regular offerings. And he focused on hate.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies. Literally everything this man does is a racket.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump’s predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “smarter” way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama’s policies killed a lot of innocent people.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump’s military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates.

"Trump’s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly, babble incoherently, or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him. Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/

"PERHAPS THE MOST devastating dimension of Trump’s time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP’s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"The public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump’s running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man. With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they’ve cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Trump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he’s going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"More broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump’s time in office is profound and terrifying.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Out in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban — and in some ways has succeeded in banning — Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge?",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Trump’s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won’t openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Donald Trump’s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let’s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"What would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers’ rights, civil rights, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus, and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"IT IS IN contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden’s chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that “I’m not Trump” combined with Biden having been Obama’s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"There is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump’s core belief that corruption isn’t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election’s integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden’s cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for, and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing. In numerous interactions with voters, Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner; told an immigrant rights activist to “vote for Trump”; called voters childish names; and threatened a union worker in Detroit, telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker “want[s] to go outside with me.” Let’s not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding “Corn Pop” at the pool. Trump’s temperament is frightening, but Biden isn’t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. “You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,” is not a good line. “Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency” — also not a winning zinger. And don’t think for a moment that Trump won’t hammer away on Biden’s Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"There is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden’s career, his policy record, his mental stamina, or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination. All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months. The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden’s candidacy. Obama and other senior party leaders, major news organizations, and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality. Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot. Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men, the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"What we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying. What we get with Biden, in his current form, is less apparent. Biden will have a team of competent (for better and worse) technocrats and, in all likelihood, an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show. Biden’s administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas. It will, without a doubt, also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish, corporatist Democratic apparatchiks. It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street, believes in bloated war budgets, and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire. It’s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can’t even bank on a return to Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Biden isn’t great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden’s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric. Biden’s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden’s record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"The Obama-Biden administration’s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “deporter in chief,” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “big mistake.” At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama’s torrid pace of deportations. “Absolutely not,” he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden’s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn’t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Biden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “a pariah.” That’s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom’s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/

"Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don’t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don’t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “the team” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"So what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, “I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, “I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.” None of these people’s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “bending the knee” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders’s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama’s troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden’s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden’s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"In the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party’s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s. Unlike Ralph Nader’s independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party’s own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party’s primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"The traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"The war for the future of the Democratic Party is intensifying. There is a possibility of a fracture or at least more clearly defined factions within the party. There will be serious discussions around forming a new party that isn’t the Green Party, but rather an outgrowth of the “Not Me, Us” framework of the Sanders campaign and the growing popularity of groups like the Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, prison abolitionists, immigrant rights groups, and Democratic Socialists of America. It would be a great thing for this country to have a democratic socialist party grow, one that runs serious political campaigns. We have already seen early stage efforts at this with mixed results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez understands the need to engage in strategic partnerships with establishment Democrats to achieve meaningful policy change and strengthen the areas of common ground. But there will need to be a lot more like-minded politicians elected for the strategy to succeed. This primary has shaken the Democratic establishment to its core, and that is a good thing and should be built on.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
But none of that is going to happen before November.,,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"Some Sanders supporters who are deeply concerned by the candidacy of Biden have said he can have their vote but not their soul. For many people that will be their strategic rationale. For others, it will be a question of individual or collective morality in the face of Trump’s horrors. Leftist voters in swing states shoulder a greater moral burden than the rest of us, and many will decide to vote against Trump by pulling the lever for Biden.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"There are also very vocal opponents of Biden who are fed up and are flat out going to refuse to vote for him. They recognize that the opposite of Trump is not Biden. They want a society where free health care is a right and wars are ended, where everyone has housing and work that pays livable wages, where you don’t amass a mountain of debt to get an education, and one that treats immigrants and workers with dignity and defends a woman’s absolute right to choose. They want the racist justice system dismantled and ICE to be abolished. They believe we are in a climate emergency and that Biden is a part of the problem. Mainstream Democrats tell them they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don’t believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats’ cheap dates — treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/
"If Democrats want to try to win them over, they should use the next six months to show them you take their concerns about 2016 seriously and map out the ways this campaign is different. Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump. For them, “He’s not Trump” is not a gamble worth taking. The onus is on the Biden campaign and its supporters to make their case to every eligible voter in this country and earn their votes. No one should be taken for granted.",,theintercept.com,https://theintercept.com/2020/04/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-2020-presidential-election-voting/

The president’s full-throated support of Israel’s war in Gaza continues to hurt him with young voters and voters of color—and the threat that Trump would be worse isn’t resonating.,,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"The 2024 presidential election is less than a year away, and polls continue to show President Joe Biden tied with or losing to future federal felon Donald Trump. While I don’t put much stock in polls taken a year before the election (at this point in 2011, Barack Obama would have lost the 2012 race to a plumber), Biden’s falling approval numbers with young voters and voters of color is frightening. In particular, Biden’s full-throated support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the low value he and his administration seem to place on the lives of Palestinians, appear to be hurting him with Arab American voters and young voters of all backgrounds.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"Plenty of Americans think Biden is doing the right thing in the Middle East. If you are one of those people, you should vote for Biden next November. Even the conservative Fox News commentator Brit Hume praised Biden’s leadership during this international crisis, so hopefully Biden can count on his vote. Best of luck with that.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"But there are other Americans—people no less important to Biden’s coalition, and more reliable as Democratic voters than Fox pundits—who view his foreign policy as aiding and abetting war crimes against the Palestinian people. Some Arab Americans have declared they simply will not vote for Biden (a recent poll found that just 17 percent of Arab Americans plan to vote for the president next year, sharply down from the 59 percent who supported him in 2020), and social media is awash with young people saying they will not vote for him either.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"The response to these voters from other, more establishment Democrats—particularly to the Arab American voters, both on social media and in most cable news coverage—has been vicious. Biden supporters on social media seem to relish pointing out that Trump would “have you deported,” adding that they’ll deserve what they get if Trump wins. Older voters call the young ones petulant and ill-informed if they try to hold Biden accountable for the role America plays in the civilian deaths in Gaza. And always, there is the suggestion that these voters are antisemitic, as if opposing the slaughter of Jews and opposing the slaughter of Palestinians are mutually exclusive positions.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"I will be voting for Joe Biden. I am a single-issue voter—that single issue is the Supreme Court—and being a single-issue voter allows me to put on ethical blinders to just about everything else. But even if I weren’t, “Don’t blame me, I voted for Kodos” is something I need to be able to say in whatever work camp a second Trump term would land me in. But my vote is not the one I’m worried about. I do not think establishment Democrats and hard-core Biden supporters appreciate how useless the “Trump would be worse” argument is to young voters, and how insulting it is to throw Trump out there as the boogeyman that is supposed to ensure Arab American complicity in another war in the Middle East.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"Every single Arab American or Muslim voter I know is well aware of Trump’s disastrous and racist policies. Telling a Muslim about the “Muslim ban” is like telling a fat person like me about Weight Watchers: Yes, I’ve heard of it! I am aware of calories, yet clearly have made different choices regardless of that knowledge. What Arab Americans and especially Palestinian Americans are saying is not that Trump would be a better president for their community, but that Biden’s decision not to do anything to stop the bombardment and killing of their families and friends means that the differences between the two hardly matter.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"For most young voters and non-Arab voters of color, the pain of war is not as immediate. Still, for many, the distinction between Trump and Biden on war is not nearly as clear as most Democrats think it is or should be. Both Trump and Biden support Israel’s war. Trump is a racist, bilious, incompetent supporter. Biden is an avuncular, Beltway, competent support. As far as young voters are concerned, the end results are similar: billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Israel, with either more or less unhinged racism to go along with the cash.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"The astute reader will note that I’ve been comparing Trump to Biden as if this will be the choice facing American voters next fall. But this is a false choice—a false binary that I subscribe to, but that many young voters do not. I’m not actually worried that a majority of Arab American or young voters will vote for Trump; I’m worried that they’ll stay home and not vote at all. The ultimate weakness in the “Trump would be worse” argument is that many voters will see two candidates they don’t like and simply avoid the polls or cast protest votes for a third-party candidate running for president.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"Remember, there are a lot of young voters who don’t want to vote for Biden anyway, for a variety of reasons. Many young people felt pressured into voting for him in 2020 because of the unique threat to democratic self-government posed by Trump. That threat is no less real in 2024, but this time around, Biden’s foreign policy is giving young voters a moral stance to pin their dissatisfaction to. And many voters of color who already viewed voting for Biden as merely a harm-mitigation strategy are wondering how the guy who ran against white supremacy now lets his team smear protesters who call for peace as equivalent to the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"Responding to these valid moral criticisms with “Well, I hope you like it when Trump deports your family and takes away your voting rights” might feel like a cutting retort, but it’s actually a schoolyard bully’s threat masquerading as a political position. It’s an attempt at coercion, and unless you’re going to double down and show up to people’s houses with a baseball bat and a van on Election Day, it’s not a winning get-out-the-vote strategy.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/
"If you come across a young person or a person of color who voted for Biden in 2020 but is determined not to do so in 2024, you can try to ignore them and hope their anger will dissipate closer to the election. You can scream at them and stomp your feet and blame them for risking democracy. But just know that your use of Trump as a threat is not convincing them. The people saying they won’t vote for Biden know that Trump would be worse. They’re saying Biden should be better.",,www.thenation.com,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/biden-democrats-dont-get-hes-in-trouble-on-gaza/

"Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to the international climate summit known as COP28 in Dubai this weekend. The White House says President Joe Biden asked Harris to go to emphasize the importance of the conference and to showcase U.S. leadership on climate at home and abroad. But young people in particular have been pushing Biden to do more when it comes to climate. They have been calling for Biden himself to attend the global meeting. Here to talk about the politics around all of this is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara.",,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan

"LIASSON: Well, first of all, the purpose of the summit is to see if these big fossil fuel-consuming countries can meet their promises to keep the Earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Politically, who goes for the United States is important because this is an example of the difficulty Biden has had with young voters. Young people care very deeply about climate, about the state of the Earth that they're going to inherit, and the White House was feeling the pressure. A source familiar with the plans to send the vice president told our colleague Deepa Shivaram that that pressure made them decide to send Vice President Harris.",,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan
So climate was a big part of Biden's campaign for president in 2020. He's taken some big actions related to climate change since then. He's in Colorado today actually talking about wind power. The Inflation Reduction Act that he signed put huge investments into climate policy - $370 billion. He doesn't get a whole lot of credit for that. But young voters want him to do more. They want him to solve problems and not just on climate. They want the high cost of housing addressed. They want the Israeli-Hamas war to be ended. They want student loan forgiveness. And they're frustrated that Biden can't do more.,,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan

"LIASSON: Absolutely. The war in the Middle East is a motivating issue for young voters, young people right now. This is one place where Biden and young people pushing for an end to Israel's military actions are actually at odds. On climate, they agree. They just think Biden should be doing more. The Middle East is where there is a real policy difference between young voters, between voters of color - very important parts of the Democratic base - and the Biden administration. Whether this issue will hurt Biden next year depends on how long the Hamas-Israeli war lasts. But right now, it's showing some deep rifts inside the Democratic Party which could be a real problem for Biden.",,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan
"Now, climate is not going away. It's going to be an issue now. It's going to be an issue next year. We'll have to see how big of an impact it has on motivating young people to either vote for Biden, stay home or find a third party alternative.",,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan

"LIASSON: The White House has used her as an ambassador to young voters, to the Democratic base, on a whole lot of issues. She's gone on the road. She's talked on college campuses about climate change, about abortion, about gun laws. It hasn't all been smooth for her. At one of her last stops, protesters were shouting about the administration's approach to Gaza. But it's just not clear if Harris is going to be the person to galvanize the youth vote.",,www.npr.org,https://www.npr.org/2023/11/29/1215914493/biden-wants-to-win-over-young-voters-they-want-him-to-do-more-about-climate-chan

"LIASSON: It means there's a huge problem for Joe Biden. This is really important. He is not at risk of losing young voters to Trump. He's at risk of young voters not being enthusiastic. This is going to be a close election, a turnout election. Biden needs every single base Democratic voter to show up at the polls. We know from polling that Republicans are already more enthusiastic about voting in 2024 than Democrats are, so Biden can't afford any apathy among his supporters. And, you know, having a voter who stays home or votes for a third party is really the same thing as losing a vote to Trump because the person who gets a plurality of votes in states is the one who wins all the electors. That's our system. It's not a popular vote system.

"On the night the 2020 Democratic National Convention kicked off, Democrats welcomed Republican speakers to the stage in an effort to lure GOP voters to cross the aisle in November. While crossover speakers at party conventions are quite common, Monday night’s Republican lineup—John Kasich, Susan Molinari, Meg Whitman and Christine Todd Whitman—was designed to show off the Democrats’ big-tent strategy. In addition to the Republicans were Senator Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. On Monday night the Biden campaign was trying to signal that all are welcome into the Democratic fold, and that opposition to Donald Trump does not mean their decision should be to stay home.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
Will it work?,,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"In any presidential election, there are voters who cross party lines. As the parties have become polarized and party affiliation and ideology have become largely synonymous, crossover voting in presidential elections has become much less frequent. For comparison, CNN’s 2016 exit polls show that only 8% of Democrats voted for Donald Trump and 8% of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"Despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that his support within the Republican Party is 96%, that claim is simply not true. Past polling has shown that there are a small percentage of people who continue to identify as Republicans who disapprove of President Trump, but that the number may be higher this year. Between June and August, surveys from The Economist/YouGov in the first week of each month showed Republicans’ approval hovering around 85%, with Republicans’ disapproval between 14-15%.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"There is some ground for Mr. Biden to take a larger percentage of Republicans in 2020 than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Yet, it is hard to imagine that Monday night’s speakers will do the trick and move voters who are on the fence. One of those speakers is a former Ohio governor and another is a former New York congresswoman who hasn’t served in the House since the mid-1990s. Republicans likely have a firm idea of whether they support or oppose President Trump, and a Republican endorsement of Biden likely will not affect that decision. At the same time, President Trump has easy ammunition to criticize Monday night’s speakers, claiming that John Kasich—who Mr. Trump beat in the 2016 presidential primary—and Meg Whitman—who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016—are not real Republicans.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"Another group of voters getting attention from media—beyond Republicans looking to vote across party lines—are former Republicans who now identify as independents or as Democrats. Those former Republicans surely exist, including media personalities like MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough (who has renounced his GOP affiliation) and the Republicans who started the TV-savvy, anti-Trump political action committee The Lincoln Project. Yet, Gallup polling shows that the percentage of the public that self-identifies as a Republican has held stable since Donald Trump was elected president. That number was 28% both in December 2016 and July 2020, and thus, former Republicans are few in number.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"For both groups—former Republicans and Republicans who oppose the president—their choice is not between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Their choice is between Joe Biden and staying home. These voters know who Donald Trump is, and they don’t care for what they see. These voters want to hear better policies, ideas, and vision. They also want to see in Mr. Biden a type of leadership they believe America should have, but they do not think America currently has. They know they will not agree with the former vice president on everything, but it is Mr. Biden who must convince him he is the safer bet.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"And in fact, to convey that “safety,” another group of elected officials may actually play an even stronger role in demonstrating to Republicans and former Republicans why Joe Biden is a safe bet: moderate Democrats. Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) [who spoke Monday night] and Reps. Collin Peterson (Minn.) and Joe Cunningham (S.C.) can present themselves as moderate legislators who will not give Joe Biden a blank check to implement ultra-liberal policies. Even though John Kasich noted that many Republicans may not have imagined voting for Joe Biden and went on to say, “I don’t believe Joe will turn sharp left,” that message would be better received from other sources than a man who came up short in a primary against the president.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"Appealing to moderate voters (a group that can include Republicans and former Republicans) is essential for Mr. Biden’s success, but it is part of a difficult balancing act that the Democratic ticket must undertake. Progressives do not want to hear from an anti-abortion, union-busting conservative governor from Ohio. Republicans don’t want to hear from a self-proclaimed socialist who supports Medicare-For-All and the Green New Deal. It is incumbent on the nominee to give both of those groups a reason to see in him the better path forward, but there may be limits to what even Mr. Biden can accomplish on this front.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/
"In an already abbreviated party convention, Democrats have precious time to fix some of the divisions that exist within their party, generate enthusiasm in the base, and communicate to independents that they are more than just “Not Donald Trump,” but a party of ideas that they can support. And for Trump-skeptical Republicans and former Republicans, they see a three-way race among a tax-and-spend liberal, a print-and-spend conservative, and the decision to stay home. John Kasich speaking on the DNC stage Monday night may not switch many voters. Instead, Donald Trump is the Republican with the greatest capacity to push Biden-curious Republicans to go to the polls and vote Democratic.",,www.brookings.edu,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/kasich-cant-help-biden-win-over-republicans-but-trump-can/

Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, urged Democrats in her state to vote against President Joe Biden in the Feb. 27 primary, citing his support of Israel as they wage war with Hamas in Gaza.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary
"She urged her fellow Democrats to instead vote “uncommitted” to protest the president in a video posted over the weekend by Listen to Michigan, a campaign run by her sister opposing “war and genocide in Gaza.” More than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday. The war began when 1,200 were killed and 250 were taken hostage during an Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary
"“This is the way you can raise our voices. Don't make us even more invisible. Right now we feel completely neglected and just unseen by our government,” Tlaib said outside a civic center in Dearborn, Mich., on Saturday. Over half of the city’s 110,000 people are of Arab descent, according to the U.S. Census. “If you want us to be louder, then come here and vote ‘uncommitted.’”",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary
"Michigan’s primary is not until the end of the month, but early voting began on Saturday and runs through Feb. 25. On the Democratic ballot, Biden faces only Minnesota Rep.

"But the call to vote “uncommitted,” an option in Michigan, comes as Biden faces criticism from some corners of his own party, including Muslim and Arab Americans, that his Israel policy is failing to reign in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his bombardment of Gaza. The Biden administration has pushed back on Israel’s planned ground attack on Rafah, a city in Gaza’s south where around 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have congregated as 80% of their homes have been destroyed, according to U.N. officials",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary
"Despite a growing public gap between Biden and Netanyahu, the president is pushing for billions in military aid for Israel, as well as funds for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. For Tlaib and others who share her views, including antiwar protestors who have disrupted speeches by the president and other politicians across the country in recent months, continuing to enable and support Israel’s war effort is tantamount to assisting genocide.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary

We want to support life. We want to stand up for every single life killed in Gaza.”",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/02/20/rashida-tlaib-israel-palestine-gaza-biden-michigan-primary

"Something strange happened during our recent Times Opinion focus group, the 18th and final one of 2023. When we asked the participants (13 Democrats, Republicans and independents) how they felt about the economy, we didn’t hear the same chorus of complaints that our other groups pretty consistently intoned all year. Our participants were by no means cheery, but several were upbeat, and even the Trump voters in the group weren’t aggrieved about the economy — so much so that our focus group moderator, Frank Luntz, looked a little surprised and said, “OK, this is not that bad. In fact, this is reasonably good.”",,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/29/opinion/2023-america-focus-group.html
"Our intent with this focus group was to bring together people who voted for Joe Biden or Donald Trump in 2020 and explore areas where they agreed or disagreed about the year we just went through. The usual partisan divisions fell away in a few places: In addition to seeing some upsides on the economy, several of the Biden and Trump voters expressed concern about ongoing aid to Ukraine, worry about the U.S. border with Mexico and a desire for Mr. Biden not to run for re-election. The group was more divided over Israel and Gaza and over the prosecutions of Mr. Trump.",,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/29/opinion/2023-america-focus-group.html
"We asked what the participants would say to Mr. Biden if he had been listening to the group. Angela, a 56-year-old Black woman from Califonia who supported him in 2020, said, “Thank you for your many years of service in politics. Go home. Enjoy your wife. Enjoy your life.” Sean, a 39-year-old white man from Georgia who voted for Mr. Biden last time, said, “You got to let somebody else step in. He’s not going to have a good run at this point.”",,www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/29/opinion/2023-america-focus-group.html

"The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence.[9] The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[10] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[11]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics, Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[d] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in presidential primary history, to runner-up Bill Weld's one delegate in the Republican primaries.[12] Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate.",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others; the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[13][14][15] Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail.[16] Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[17][18] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[19]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since 1992, in Arizona since 1996, and in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2008.[20][21]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[22][23][24][25][26] attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results,[27] falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states,[28][29][30][31] in what was described by many as an attempted coup d'état. Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[32][33] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[34][35][36] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[37] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing numerous lawsuits in several states (most of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[38][39][40] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[41] pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a phone call that later became widely publicized) and legislators to change results,[42] pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election ""corrupt"" and intervene,[43][44] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[45][46] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[47] With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to ""fight like hell"", a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count.[48][49][50] On January 7, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name.[51][52][53] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021; in a break from tradition, Trump did not attend his successor's inauguration.[54] Trump was indicted on August 1, 2023, on four counts relating to conspiring to overturn the results.",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[55] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals. The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various state and local-level elections.[56]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.[57][58] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court[59][60] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020.[61] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election,[62][63] and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.[64] An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October 6.[65] The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine's electors (Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way).[66] While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first-choice votes statewide and in each district, use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third-party or independent candidates.[67]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government.[68][69][70] The newly elected Congress, with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes, which began on January 6, 2021, was interrupted by the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and finished the following day.[71]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the apportionment of House seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 United States census occurred, and the states conducted redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting, although some states have redistricting commissions. Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.[72] The party that won the 2020 presidential election could have also won a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts, which would stay in effect until 2032.[73]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[103][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[105][106] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[107] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[108][109]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Several events related to the 2020 presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and its effects, such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.[110][111] On March 12, Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.[112] The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington, D.C.[113] Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,[114] Kentucky,[115] Louisiana,[116] Ohio,[117] and Maryland.[118] As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates had halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID-19 concerns. Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation, could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.[119][120][121]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID-19-related issues, including long lines at polling places, greatly increased requests for absentee ballots, and technology issues.[122] Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic, the number of polling places was often greatly reduced. Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative, but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested.[123]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"The March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail-in voting. By May, Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud, a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations.[124][125] Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus, became a major campaign issue for both parties.[126][127]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

As a result, the elections, which included a presidential primary, went ahead on April 7 as planned.[128] At least seven new cases of COVID-19 were traced to this election.

"On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[130] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a ""flop"", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[131] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[132] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[133] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[134]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"On October 2, 2020, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a positive test from his senior advisor, Hope Hicks, as part of the larger COVID-19 outbreak among White House personnel. Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine, which prevented Trump from further campaigning, notably at campaign rallies.[135][136][137] Later that day, the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever, where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment.[138][139] Trump's diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump; Biden tested negative.[140][141] Trump was discharged from the hospital on October 5.[142]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID-19, an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump, due to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings.[143][144] Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies, which were a major part of his campaign. As a result of Trump contracting COVID-19, Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him.[145][146] On October 12, one week after his discharge from the hospital, Trump resumed in-person rallies.[142] Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies, sometimes two or three in a day. His rallies were criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing, and some polls suggested that voters saw him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees.[147][148]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected.[154][155] The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. On February 21, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed U.S. officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, ""I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.""[156] Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior.[157] In a February 2020 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support Trump's reelection campaign; Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat, and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, for allowing the briefing to go forward.[158][159] China and some government-linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump,[160] though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community.[159][161]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

The emails warned, ""You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.""[162] Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails, using a spoofed return address, had been sent by Iran. He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data, possibly from publicly available information, and ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy."" A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation.[163] In his announcement, Ratcliffe said Iran's intent had been ""to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump"", raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump. It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe's prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage; he had added it on his own.[164] On November 18, 2021, the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information.[165]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

Nonetheless, after his dismissal, in a December 2020 interview, Chris Krebs, the Trump administration's director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described monitoring Election Day from CISA's joint command center along with representatives from the military's United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment, and representatives of state and local governments, as well as his agency's analysis preceding and after that day, saying, ""It was quiet.

No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.""[177][178][179][180] Trump repeatedly claimed that ""the only way"" he could lose would be if the election was ""rigged"" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[181][182] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud;[183][184][185] at one point, Trump said, ""We'll see what happens ... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.""[186] Trump's statements have been described as a threat ""to upend the constitutional order"".[187] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A.

Experts[who?] indicated that, for the election to be legally delayed, such a decision must be made by Congress.[194][195] And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice-presidential terms at January 20, a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment.[196][197]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common, with 25% of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places.[199] An August 2020 state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 – more than double the number in 2016.[200] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots.[201] In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots, the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy, the newly installed United States Postmaster General, including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail,[202] which caused delays in delivering mail,[203] and dismantling and removing hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines from postal centers.[204] On August 18, after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes, DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election.

This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re-election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than he did in the previous election, after 1828. It is also the third election in which the two candidates that received electoral votes carried the same number of states.

"Biden won 25 states, the District of Columbia, and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump won 25 states and one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. This result was exactly the reverse of Trump's victory, 306 to 232, in 2016 (excluding faithless electors).[320] Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since 1992 and in Arizona since 1996,[20] and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since 1992 and Ohio since 1960, casting doubt on Ohio's continued status as a bellwether state.[321] Biden carried five states won by Trump in 2016: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also became the first Democrat since 2008 to carry Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, winning one electoral vote from the state. Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in 2016. Biden's three gains in the Rust Belt—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall, a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from 1992 to 2012, broken by Trump in 2016 when he flipped those three Rust Belt states.[322][323][324][325] Nevertheless, amidst Trump's national and electoral defeat, his scoring decisive victories in Ohio, Iowa, and Florida for the second time, after their having backed Obama twice, has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states.[326][327]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"In light of the attempts to contest the election results, an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome. If Biden's three narrowest state victories—Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point—had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[328][329] causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally. A similar situation occurred in 2016, when a shift of 0.77% or less in each of the three most closely contested states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), or about 77,000 votes, would have resulted in the popular-vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College.[330]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties. This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban–rural divide.[331]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[332] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[332] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[332] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[332] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[333] Biden became the oldest president ever elected, besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984, and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016.",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters.

Frey attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college-educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older White without college degrees.[359] Frey says the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among White and older Americans.[359] Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 16%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since 1980. Democrats won the Latino vote by 32%, which is the smallest margin since 2004, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.[359] Biden reduced the Republican margin of white men without college educations from 48% to 42%, and the Democrats made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women.

In Florida, Trump won a majority of Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Florida.[363] The Latino vote was still crucial to enable Biden to carry states such as Nevada.[364] Latino voters were targeted by a major Spanish-language disinformation campaign in the final weeks of the election, with various falsehoods and conspiracy theories being pushed out by WhatsApp and viral social media posts.[365][366][367]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls overestimated him by three to four points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than 2016's error (one or two points).[386] The numbers represented the highest level of error since the 1980 presidential election.[387] This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls,[388] as well as the House elections, where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted. Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states, including Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states.

"Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts[407] attributed this to several factors, including a ""red mirage"" of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.[408][409][410]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[412] Meanwhile, a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign's lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[413] That judge also noted the official complaint did not state ""why"", ""when, where, or by whom"" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[414]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

While Donald Trump privately acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election, he nonetheless encouraged his legal team to continue pursuing legal challenges.[420] Trump expected to win the election in Arizona, but when Fox News declared Biden the victor of the state, Trump became furious and claimed the result was due to fraud.[421] Trump and his allies suffered approximately 50 legal losses in four weeks after starting their litigation.[422] In view of these legal defeats, Trump began to employ ""a public pressure campaign on state and local Republican officials to manipulate the electoral system on his behalf"".[421][423][424][425]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

Police in Minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway. In Portland, the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police.[426] At the same time, groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix, Detroit, and Philadelphia, shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground.[426] In Arizona, where Biden's lead was shrinking as more results were reported, the pro-Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted, while in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump's lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported, they called for the count to be stopped.[427]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent. Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked.[430][431] On November 9 and 10, The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state; all 45 of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud. Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic, the record turnout, and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots.[33] On November 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a statement calling the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history"" and noting ""[t]here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""[35] Five days later, Trump fired the director of CISA, whom he had appointed in 2018.[432]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day, Trump falsely asserted that there was ""tremendous corruption and fraud going on"", adding: ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""[433] Trump has repeatedly claimed as suspicious that mail-in ballots showed significantly more support for Biden.[434] This blue shift phenomenon is believed to occur because more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail, and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states. Leading up to the 2020 election, the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual, as Trump's attacks on mail-in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots.[435]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

But we won every single statehouse.""[436] Two days later, on January 4, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton, Georgia, supporting Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.

Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result, with 62% of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, while 37% did not.[456] This split in popular opinion remained largely stable, with a January 10, 2021, poll commissioned by ABC News showing 68% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate and 32% did not.[457] These numbers remained largely stagnant, with a June 2021 poll from Monmouth showing 61% believed Biden won fair and square, 32% believed he won due to fraud, and 7% were unsure.[458] More than a year later, public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant, with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that 65% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 33% believed it was not legitimate, and 2% were unsure. The same poll also found that 72% of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were attacking democracy, while 25% thought they were protecting democracy, and 3% were unsure.[459] A March 2022 poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that 52% of voters think that it is likely that cheating ""affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election."" while 40% of voters believe that it is unlikely. 33% say that cheating was very likely, 19% say it was somewhat likely, 13% say it was somewhat unlikely, and 27% say it was very unlikely.[460]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

We were getting ready to win this election, frankly we did win this election.""[478] For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him, Trump refused to formally concede, breaking with the tradition of formal concession started in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President-elect William McKinley.[479] Biden described Trump's refusal as ""an embarrassment"".[480]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"Both before and after the election, Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican-controlled state legislatures to select presidential electors favoring Trump, even if Biden won the popular vote in those states.[488] In Pennsylvania, a state which Biden won, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider allowing the Republican-controlled state legislature to select electors.[489] Legal experts, including New York University law professor Richard Pildes, have raised numerous legal and political objections to this policy, noting that in various battleground states, Democratic Party members holding statewide office would thwart such efforts,[490] and ultimately Congress would probably reject the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those elected by the voters.[491] Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected, including the power to directly appoint them, Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed, which they have designated to be Election Day, meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date.[492] In modern times, most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state's electors,[490] and changing election rules after an election could also violate the Constitution's Due Process Clause.[493]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"As the Trump campaign's lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states, including state legislators, attorneys general, and governors who had supported him during and after the elections. He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes, throwing out certain votes, or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature.[503] In late November, he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan, urging them to reverse their vote certifications.[504] He invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House, where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors.[505] He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state, demanding that they reverse their state's election results, and retaliating when they did not, strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets, and demanding that the governor resign.[506]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"During the first week of December, Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives, urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors; the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state's representatives in Congress to dispute the results.[503] On January 4 The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January 2, Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's result, telling him ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate.[42][507] On January 4, 2021, Democratic congressional leaders, believing Trump ""engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes"", requested the FBI to investigate the incident.[508] In addition, while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump's Georgia call, Democrats began drafting a censure resolution.[509] Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had misquoted Trump, and added a correction to the article.[510] Also on January 2, 2021, Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly 300 state legislators from Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in which he urged them to ""decertify"" the election results in their states.[511]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election
"On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 13,558 votes.[512] The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,284 votes. Therefore, the results of the hand recount netted Trump 1,274 votes. The change in the count was due to a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally.[513][514] After certifying the results Republican governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots, despite the fact that this request was impossible,[466] as signatures on mail-in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices, and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.[515][516] The Trump campaign requested a machine recount, which was estimated to cost taxpayers $200,000 in one Georgia county alone.[517] On December 7, Biden was confirmed as the winner of the recount requested by Trump's campaign.[466]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

Biden also condemned Trump, and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome, for adopting a stance ""so extreme that we've never seen it before – a position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution"" and for exposing state election workers and officials to ""political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence"" that was ""simply unconscionable"".[527][526]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states,[528][529] meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects, the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote.[530][531] A statement from the vice president's office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to ""raise objections and bring forward evidence"" challenging the election results.[532]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election

"On January 6, 2021, shortly after Trump continued to press false claims of election fraud at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, interrupting the Joint session of the United States Congress where the Electoral College ballots were being certified and forcing lawmakers to flee the chamber. As part of an organized effort by Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in close states, the House and the Senate were meeting separately to debate the results of Arizona's election and accepting the electoral college ballots submitted. Several other challenges were also planned. Congress reconvened that same night, after the Capitol was cleared of trespassers, and leaders of both parties, including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Speaker Mitch McConnell urged the legislators to confirm the electors. The Senate resumed its session at around 8:00 p.m. to finish debating the objection to the Arizona and Pennsylvania electors were also considered.

Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans. The pact was formalized in a terse, little-noticed joint statement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day. Both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain–inspired by the summer’s massive, sometimes destructive racial-justice protests–in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump’s assault on democracy.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America’s institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from a remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined President. Though much of this activity took place on the left, it was separate from the Biden campaign and crossed ideological lines, with crucial contributions by nonpartisan and conservative actors. The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory.

They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

Before the election, Trump plotted to block a legitimate vote count.

A group of liberal strategists he brought together in the early 2000s led to the creation of the Analyst Institute, a secretive firm that applies scientific methods to political campaigns. He was also involved in the founding of Catalist, the flagship progressive data company.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The endless chatter in Washington about “political strategy,” Podhorzer believes, has little to do with how change really gets made. “My basic take on politics is that it’s all pretty obvious if you don’t overthink it or swallow the prevailing frameworks whole,” he once wrote. “After that, just relentlessly identify your assumptions and challenge them.” Podhorzer applies that approach to everything: when he coached his now adult son’s Little League team in the D.C. suburbs, he trained the boys not to swing at most pitches–a tactic that infuriated both their and their opponents’ parents, but won the team a series of championships.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Trump’s election in 2016–credited in part to his unusual strength among the sort of blue collar white voters who once dominated the AFL-CIO–prompted Podhorzer to question his assumptions about voter behavior. He began circulating weekly number-crunching memos to a small circle of allies and hosting strategy sessions in D.C. But when he began to worry about the election itself, he didn’t want to seem paranoid. It was only after months of research that he introduced his concerns in his newsletter in October 2019. The usual tools of data, analytics and polling would not be sufficient in a situation where the President himself was trying to disrupt the election, he wrote. “Most of our planning takes us through Election Day,” he noted. “But, we are not prepared for the two most likely outcomes”–Trump losing and refusing to concede, and Trump winning the Electoral College (despite losing the popular vote) by corrupting the voting process in key states. “We desperately need to systematically ‘red-team’ this election so that we can anticipate and plan for the worst we know will be coming our way.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"It turned out Podhorzer wasn’t the only one thinking in these terms. He began to hear from others eager to join forces. The Fight Back Table, a coalition of “resistance” organizations, had begun scenario-planning around the potential for a contested election, gathering liberal activists at the local and national level into what they called the Democracy Defense Coalition. Voting-rights and civil rights organizations were raising alarms. A group of former elected officials was researching emergency powers they feared Trump might exploit. Protect Democracy was assembling a bipartisan election-crisis task force. “It turned out that once you said it out loud, people agreed,” Podhorzer says, “and it started building momentum.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"He spent months pondering scenarios and talking to experts. It wasn’t hard to find liberals who saw Trump as a dangerous dictator, but Podhorzer was careful to steer clear of hysteria. What he wanted to know was not how American democracy was dying but how it might be kept alive. The chief difference between the U.S. and countries that lost their grip on democracy, he concluded, was that America’s decentralized election system couldn’t be rigged in one fell swoop. That presented an opportunity to shore it up.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"On March 3, Podhorzer drafted a three-page confidential memo titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” “Trump has made it clear that this will not be a fair election, and that he will reject anything but his own re-election as ‘fake’ and rigged,” he wrote. “On Nov. 3, should the media report otherwise, he will use the right-wing information system to establish his narrative and incite his supporters to protest.” The memo laid out four categories of challenges: attacks on voters, attacks on election administration, attacks on Trump’s political opponents and “efforts to reverse the results of the election.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Then COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary-election season. Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff polling places. But political disagreements, intensified by Trump’s crusade against mail voting, prevented some states from making it easier to vote absentee and for jurisdictions to count those votes in a timely manner. Chaos ensued. Ohio shut down in-person voting for its primary, leading to minuscule turnout. A poll-worker shortage in Milwaukee–where Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic Black population is concentrated–left just five open polling places, down from 182. In New York, vote counting took more than a month.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Suddenly, the potential for a November meltdown was obvious. In his apartment in the D.C. suburbs, Podhorzer began working from his laptop at his kitchen table, holding back-to-back Zoom meetings for hours a day with his network of contacts across the progressive universe: the labor movement; the institutional left, like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace; resistance groups like Indivisible and MoveOn; progressive data geeks and strategists, representatives of donors and foundations, state-level grassroots organizers, racial-justice activists and others.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"In April, Podhorzer began hosting a weekly 2½-hour Zoom. It was structured around a series of rapid-fire five-minute presentations on everything from which ads were working to messaging to legal strategy. The invitation-only gatherings soon attracted hundreds, creating a rare shared base of knowledge for the fractious progressive movement. “At the risk of talking trash about the left, there’s not a lot of good information sharing,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a close Podhorzer friend whose poll-tested messaging guidance shaped the group’s approach. “There’s a lot of not-invented-here syndrome, where people won’t consider a good idea if they didn’t come up with it.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The meetings became the galactic center for a constellation of operatives across the left who shared overlapping goals but didn’t usually work in concert. The group had no name, no leaders and no hierarchy, but it kept the disparate actors in sync. “Pod played a critical behind-the-scenes role in keeping different pieces of the movement infrastructure in communication and aligned,” says Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “You have the litigation space, the organizing space, the political people just focused on the W, and their strategies aren’t always aligned. He allowed this ecosystem to work together.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Protecting the election would require an effort of unprecedented scale. As 2020 progressed, it stretched to Congress, Silicon Valley and the nation’s statehouses. It drew energy from the summer’s racial-justice protests, many of whose leaders were a key part of the liberal alliance. And eventually it reached across the aisle, into the world of Trump-skeptical Republicans appalled by his attacks on democracy.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The first task was overhauling America’s balky election infrastructure–in the middle of a pandemic. For the thousands of local, mostly nonpartisan officials who administer elections, the most urgent need was money. They needed protective equipment like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. They needed to pay for postcards letting people know they could vote absentee–or, in some states, to mail ballots to every voter. They needed additional staff and scanners to process ballots.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"In March, activists appealed to Congress to steer COVID relief money to election administration. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 150 organizations signed a letter to every member of Congress seeking $2 billion in election funding. It was somewhat successful: the CARES Act, passed later that month, contained $400 million in grants to state election administrators. But the next tranche of relief funding didn’t add to that number. It wasn’t going to be enough.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Private philanthropy stepped into the breach. An assortment of foundations contributed tens of millions in election-administration funding. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative chipped in $300 million. “It was a failure at the federal level that 2,500 local election officials were forced to apply for philanthropic grants to fill their needs,” says Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election official who heads the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"McReynolds’ two-year-old organization became a clearinghouse for a nation struggling to adapt. The institute gave secretaries of state from both parties technical advice on everything from which vendors to use to how to locate drop boxes. Local officials are the most trusted sources of election information, but few can afford a press secretary, so the institute distributed communications tool kits. In a presentation to Podhorzer’s group, McReynolds detailed the importance of absentee ballots for shortening lines at polling places and preventing an election crisis.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The institute’s work helped 37 states and D.C. bolster mail voting. But it wouldn’t be worth much if people didn’t take advantage. Part of the challenge was logistical: each state has different rules for when and how ballots should be requested and returned. The Voter Participation Center, which in a normal year would have supported local groups deploying canvassers door-to-door to get out the vote, instead conducted focus groups in April and May to find out what would get people to vote by mail. In August and September, it sent ballot applications to 15 million people in key states, 4.6 million of whom returned them. In mailings and digital ads, the group urged people not to wait for Election Day. “All the work we have done for 17 years was built for this moment of bringing democracy to people’s doorsteps,” says Tom Lopach, the center’s CEO.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The effort had to overcome heightened skepticism in some communities. Many Black voters preferred to exercise their franchise in person or didn’t trust the mail. National civil rights groups worked with local organizations to get the word out that this was the best way to ensure one’s vote was counted. In Philadelphia, for example, advocates distributed “voting safety kits” containing masks, hand sanitizer and informational brochures. “We had to get the message out that this is safe, reliable, and you can trust it,” says Hannah Fried of All Voting Is Local.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"At the same time, Democratic lawyers battled a historic tide of pre-election litigation. The pandemic intensified the parties’ usual tangling in the courts. But the lawyers noticed something else as well. “The litigation brought by the Trump campaign, of a piece with the broader campaign to sow doubt about mail voting, was making novel claims and using theories no court has ever accepted,” says Wendy Weiser, a voting-rights expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. “They read more like lawsuits designed to send a message rather than achieve a legal outcome.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

"Bad actors spreading false information is nothing new. For decades, campaigns have grappled with everything from anonymous calls claiming the election has been rescheduled to fliers spreading nasty smears about candidates’ families.

"Laura Quinn, a veteran progressive operative who co-founded Catalist, began studying this problem a few years ago. She piloted a nameless, secret project, which she has never before publicly discussed, that tracked disinformation online and tried to figure out how to combat it. One component was tracking dangerous lies that might otherwise spread unnoticed. Researchers then provided information to campaigners or the media to track down the sources and expose them.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The most important takeaway from Quinn’s research, however, was that engaging with toxic content only made it worse. “When you get attacked, the instinct is to push back, call it out, say, ‘This isn’t true,'” Quinn says. “But the more engagement something gets, the more the platforms boost it. The algorithm reads that as, ‘Oh, this is popular; people want more of it.'”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The solution, she concluded, was to pressure platforms to enforce their rules, both by removing content or accounts that spread disinformation and by more aggressively policing it in the first place. “The platforms have policies against certain types of malign behavior, but they haven’t been enforcing them,” she says.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Quinn’s research gave ammunition to advocates pushing social media platforms to take a harder line. In November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election-related falsehoods that were already spreading unchecked. “It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming, all of that to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who attended the dinner and also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. (Gupta has been nominated for Associate Attorney General by President Biden.) “It was a struggle, but we got to the point where they understood the problem. Was it enough? Probably not. Was it later than we wanted? Yes. But it was really important, given the level of official disinformation, that they had those rules in place and were tagging things and taking them down.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

The 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans on the National Council on Election Integrity met on Zoom at least once a week. They ran ads in six states, made statements, wrote articles and alerted local officials to potential problems. “We had rabid Trump supporters who agreed to serve on the council based on the idea that this is honest,” Wamp says.

"The Voting Rights Lab and IntoAction created state-specific memes and graphics, spread by email, text, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, urging that every vote be counted. Together, they were viewed more than 1 billion times. Protect Democracy’s election task force issued reports and held media briefings with high-profile experts across the political spectrum, resulting in widespread coverage of potential election issues and fact-checking of Trump’s false claims. The organization’s tracking polls found the message was being heard: the percentage of the public that didn’t expect to know the winner on election night gradually rose until by late October, it was over 70%. A majority also believed that a prolonged count wasn’t a sign of problems. “We knew exactly what Trump was going to do: he was going to try to use the fact that Democrats voted by mail and Republicans voted in person to make it look like he was ahead, claim victory, say the mail-in votes were fraudulent and try to get them thrown out,” says Protect Democracy’s Bassin.

"The alliance took a common set of themes from the research Shenker-Osorio presented at Podhorzer’s Zooms. Studies have shown that when people don’t think their vote will count or fear casting it will be a hassle, they’re far less likely to participate. Throughout election season, members of Podhorzer’s group minimized incidents of voter intimidation and tamped down rising liberal hysteria about Trump’s expected refusal to concede. They didn’t want to amplify false claims by engaging them, or put people off voting by suggesting a rigged game. “When you say, ‘These claims of fraud are spurious,’ what people hear is ‘fraud,'” Shenker-Osorio says. “What we saw in our pre-election research was that anything that reaffirmed Trump’s power or cast him as an authoritarian diminished people’s desire to vote.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

Most analysts had recognized there would be a “blue shift” in key battlegrounds– the surge of votes breaking toward Democrats, driven by tallies of mail-in ballots– but they hadn’t comprehended how much better Trump was likely to do on Election Day. “Being able to document how big the absentee wave would be and the variance by state was essential,” the analyst says.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/

They created a force of “election defenders” who, unlike traditional poll watchers, were trained in de-escalation techniques.

He phoned Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan, to see if Primus agreed and would make the argument publicly. Primus said he thought the meeting itself was inappropriate, and got to work on an op-ed for Politico warning that the state attorney general–a Democrat–would have no choice but to investigate. When the piece posted on Nov. 19, the attorney general’s communications director tweeted it. Protect Democracy soon got word that the lawmakers planned to bring lawyers to the meeting with Trump the next day.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Reyes’ activists scanned flight schedules and flocked to the airports on both ends of Shirkey’s journey to D.C., to underscore that the lawmakers were being scrutinized. After the meeting, the pair announced they’d pressed the President to deliver COVID relief for their constituents and informed him they saw no role in the election process. Then they went for a drink at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A street artist projected their images onto the outside of the building along with the words THE WORLD IS WATCHING.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"That left one last step: the state canvassing board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans. One Republican, a Trumper employed by the DeVos family’s political nonprofit, was not expected to vote for certification. The other Republican on the board was a little-known lawyer named Aaron Van Langevelde. He sent no signals about what he planned to do, leaving everyone on edge.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"When the meeting began, Reyes’s activists flooded the livestream and filled Twitter with their hashtag, #alleyesonmi. A board accustomed to attendance in the single digits suddenly faced an audience of thousands. In hours of testimony, the activists emphasized their message of respecting voters’ wishes and affirming democracy rather than scolding the officials. Van Langevelde quickly signaled he would follow precedent. The vote was 3-0 to certify; the other Republican abstained.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"After that, the dominoes fell. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the rest of the states certified their electors. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia stood up to Trump’s bullying. And the Electoral College voted on schedule on Dec. 14.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"There was one last milestone on Podhorzer’s mind: Jan. 6. On the day Congress would meet to tally the electoral count, Trump summoned his supporters to D.C. for a rally.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Much to their surprise, the thousands who answered his call were met by virtually no counterdemonstrators. To preserve safety and ensure they couldn’t be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was “strenuously discouraging counter activity,” Podhorzer texted me the morning of Jan. 6, with a crossed-fingers emoji.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"Trump addressed the crowd that afternoon, peddling the lie that lawmakers or Vice President Mike Pence could reject states’ electoral votes. He told them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building. As lawmakers fled for their lives and his own supporters were shot and trampled, Trump praised the rioters as “very special.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"It was his final attack on democracy, and once again, it failed. By standing down, the democracy campaigners outfoxed their foes. “We won by the skin of our teeth, honestly, and that’s an important point for folks to sit with,” says the Democracy Defense Coalition’s Peoples. “There’s an impulse for some to say voters decided and democracy won. But it’s a mistake to think that this election cycle was a show of strength for democracy. It shows how vulnerable democracy is.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"The members of the alliance to protect the election have gone their separate ways. The Democracy Defense Coalition has been disbanded, though the Fight Back Table lives on. Protect Democracy and the good-government advocates have turned their attention to pressing reforms in Congress. Left-wing activists are pressuring the newly empowered Democrats to remember the voters who put them there, while civil rights groups are on guard against further attacks on voting. Business leaders denounced the Jan. 6 attack, and some say they will no longer donate to lawmakers who refused to certify Biden’s victory. Podhorzer and his allies are still holding their Zoom strategy sessions, gauging voters’ views and developing new messages. And Trump is in Florida, facing his second impeachment, deprived of the Twitter and Facebook accounts he used to push the nation to its breaking point.",,time.com,https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/
"As I was reporting this article in November and December, I heard different claims about who should get the credit for thwarting Trump’s plot. Liberals argued the role of bottom-up people power shouldn’t be overlooked, particularly the contributions of people of color and local grassroots activists. Others stressed the heroism of GOP officials like Van Langevelde and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who stood up to Trump at considerable cost. The truth is that neither likely could have succeeded without the other. “It’s astounding how close we came, how fragile all this really is,” says Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director. “It’s like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff–if you don’t look down, you don’t fall.

"Donald Trump’s supporters propelled him to about a 10-point victory over Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. Here, Trump speaks at an election night party in Nashua, N.H., as Vivek Ramaswamy (from left), Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Eric Trump watch.

Donald Trump won Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary by more than 10 points over Nikki Haley (54.5 to 43.2 percent) and will now sweep his way easily to the nomination.,,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
Or not.,,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
"The first scenario seemed to be the general consensus of media pundits, but some noted that Trump only attracted about half of GOP voters in the N.H. primary and Iowa caucus, raising questions about how he would fare in the general election. And Haley has vowed to fight on. The next Republican primary is in her home state, South Carolina, but Trump is favored there, too.",,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
"(President Biden, meanwhile, handily won the Democratic race in New Hampshire, even though voters had to write his name in.)",,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
We asked a handful of BU experts to help us sort out the results from a variety of perspectives.,,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
"Tammy Vigil, associate professor of media science and senior associate dean, College of Communication: 
Despite the win in New Hampshire, the results actually illustrate weaknesses in Trump’s candidacy. The likelihood Trump will secure the Republican nomination remains high, but Tuesday’s outcome revealed distinct fissures within the Republican ranks that could provide some strategic insights for Haley now and Biden during the general election. According to exit polling, Trump is not drawing support from moderate conservatives, and a high number of New Hampshire GOP voters selected Haley to indicate their opposition to Trump. Haley should more earnestly court disaffected Republicans moving forward; Biden also needs to build a space for them in his campaign.

Christine Slaughter, assistant professor of political science, College of Arts & Sciences:
Many Republican voters are looking toward the general election, presuming that Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee. The path forward for Haley looks ragged. As former South Carolina governor, losing the Republican primary would be a final dagger to her campaign. The majority of Iowa and N.H. voters support Trump and, apparently, three of his former competitors also support his candidacy. There’s enthusiasm for him, as if he’s the incumbent.

Bruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History, College of Arts & Sciences:
It was a bad [boring] night for journalists as the results came in more or less as expected. Trump won decisively but not overwhelmingly, in a contest that figured to play more to Haley’s strengths than most other Republican primaries, while Haley finished well enough to stay in the race. The only question is whether Haley will stay in for the long haul hoping that Trump’s legal worries damage his candidacy, or whether she’ll drop out after the next contested race in South Carolina.

Paul Hare, senior lecturer in international relations, Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, and former British ambassador to Cuba:
Most Republicans agree with Trump that foreign policy is a minor issue. For Trump, it’s personal. On Ukraine, Zelensky would not “do him a favor” over Hunter Biden. [As president, Trump asked Ukraine’s leader to investigate the younger Biden.] Trump likes Putin because Putin likes him. He dislikes Netanyahu because he congratulated Biden [on Biden’s 2020 win]. Trump wants to block Biden’s bipartisan deal on immigration and aid to Ukraine/Israel. He needs the US border issue to fester. Haley recognized US interests in foreign policy, but most Republicans see Democrats as the threat. Saudi Arabia is now the Trump family’s main business partner—in massive Saudi resort and sports deals and billions in investment funds.

Shawn M. Lynch, senior lecturer in social sciences, College of General Studies:
Haley did well among independents, which is trouble for Trump, but she cannot win the nomination. There is no Republican Party any longer, there is only the Trump Party. The Trump “Republican” electorate will not vote for a person of color over Trump. This party will, however, nominate someone who is a convicted rapist and utter incompetent facing 91 felony charges, who may well be in prison by November. The party and its MAGA base have chosen electoral suicide.

Rachel Meade, lecturer in political sciences, College of Arts & Sciences:
This means that Trump is very likely to be the nominee and Haley has become a long-shot candidate. If she can’t win in a state with so many independent voters (when her polling is strongest among independents), then it is unlikely she can win in states with a more traditional Republican voter base. However, this is not a normal election cycle in that the front-runner is under multiple indictments, with the January 6 trial scheduled to start during the primary season. Haley may be staying in the race so she could be poised as next in line in case a dramatic legal development changes Trump’s support base or causes the GOP to drop him. Even so, this looks like a long shot as his base has shown that they mostly see the trials as an example of politically motivated elites going after a leader that they see as a threat.",,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
"Vigil: As a write-in candidate who didn’t officially campaign in New Hampshire, Joe Biden secured over half of the Democratic votes on Tuesday and earned more than double the combined votes cast for Dean Phillips and [Marianne] Williamson in a decisive, and completely unsurprising, result. As expected, Tuesday’s outcome indicates that neither Phillips nor Williamson are viable Democratic contenders. More revealing is how the GOP primary results could inform Biden’s general election campaign. Similar to 2020, there is a clear opportunity to earn significant votes from anti-Trump Republicans, but Biden will need to be strategic about building bipartisan appeals while coalition-building.

Slaughter: There’s about a 10 percent margin between Haley and Trump in N.H. The primary set a turnout record—with many Trump supporters and voters seeking an alternative in Haley. N.H. is a competitive state, so hopefully Biden can appeal to N.H. voters who are opposed to Trump. Processing write-in ballots takes time, so it is not yet known for sure how well or how poorly Biden fared in N.H., but he had an overwhelming victory in the votes that have been counted.

Schulman: The Democratic results mean little, but if I were Biden’s campaign manager, my line would be: “Biden outperformed Trump in New Hampshire and he wasn’t even on the ballot!”

Hare: Biden got what he wanted: a Trump rematch. Haley showed independents are overwhelmingly against Trump. Biden was fearful of having to face a moderate Haley. Trump, however, has shown most Republicans now believe something Trump himself didn’t believe. His chief of staff and his daughter have testified that Trump knew he lost to Biden. But now millions are pouring money into his coffers because they see the 2020 election as stolen—just like Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his support doesn’t waver. But, as Haley remarked in New Hampshire, a Trump victory is what Democrats have been working for.

Lynch: I did not vote for Biden or Trump, but Joe Biden is the most competent president of my lifetime (1971 onward). He will win the November election in a landslide, presuming the contest is Biden vs. Trump. This is because the people that hate Trump hate him more than the people who love Trump love him. Independents have abandoned him (and will continue to do so), and there are too many people who will crawl over broken glass to keep him out of the White House. Besides, he’ll likely be imprisoned by the date of the election, and this will not expand his support.

Meade: Democrats should be focusing on the most likely scenario: a rematch with Donald Trump. They might also note the limits of an anti-Trump, pro-democracy messaging strategy, since Haley has recently been pushing something similar. Democrats will also need to show why they will be affirmatively better for voters than Trump would be—for example, by highlighting specific policies that benefit their constituencies, from the American Rescue Plan or Build Back Better Act. The MAGA base is different from the traditional GOP in having more isolationist foreign policy and more openness to social and economic spending. This can be seen in Trump’s anti-Haley ad in New Hampshire accusing her of wanting to cut Social Security [funding], and that is the area where Biden might be able to make a similar attack on Trump.",,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/
"Vigil: They might not. Edison Research’s exit polling shows Trump’s strength remains his core followers and that many New Hampshire primary participants were motivated opposition voters supporting Haley to register antipathy toward Trump. Trump’s current campaign messaging contains very few efforts to expand his appeal beyond the MAGA faithful—a strategy he also employed in 2020. Sticking with this approach, to win the general election, Trump will have to rely on voters abandoning Biden. While that could happen, it is a risky game plan, since failure to attract moderate Republicans and unaffiliated voters narrows Trump’s potential margin for victory. 

Slaughter: Turnout in midterm elections is generally lower than in presidential elections. This election is unprecedented, since Trump is facing criminal indictments and is the first former president to face criminal charges. This is his third presidential campaign. Campaigning will look different since court dates are approaching. It’s clear that despite his legal troubles, and attempt to overthrow the government on January 6, there are still voters and other politicians that support his third presidential bid.

Schulman: I would challenge the premises of this question. If you’re asking whether Trump (or Trumpist candidates) can win a majority of the popular vote, the answer is no. Trump will lose the popular vote by a wide margin, as he did in both 2016 and 2020. But the presidential contest will be decided in a handful of states, all of which Biden won very narrowly in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Whichever candidate takes three of those five states will win the election. So, Trump could still win the presidency even though I think Biden will handily win the popular vote.

Hare: History suggests there is never going to be a MAGA majority in the US. Trump lost by three million popular votes to Hillary Clinton and eight million to Biden. But, of course, a few states could be rogue outliers. So, 10,000 votes in Georgia, Michigan, or Arizona could decide the election. And America’s justice system may simply be too slow and incompetent to bring to trial Trump’s serious election indictments. They will prove, whatever legal boffins may say, that Trump truly is immune from prosecution. It’s that Fifth Avenue thing again.

Lynch: The Republican Party is dead and will likely be wiped out nationally in November. They will certainly lose control of the House and will not take the Senate. Biden will crush Trump. The party of Reagan and Bush is dead. It surrendered to an incompetent, narcissistic sociopath and adopted irrational, violent, and hateful politics. Good riddance. I feel it likely that some Republican states will refuse to accept the loss and begin talking secession after the election. They have nowhere else to go, with Trump definitively defeated. (Knock on wood!)

Meade: The failure of Trump to get his chosen candidates elected in midterm elections doesn’t necessarily tell us that much about how he would fare running himself. Populist charismatic appeals are usually quite specific to the individual and hard to transfer to someone else, and in Trump’s case, relates to his “outsider” reality TV and business background and unique speaking style and sense of humor. In terms of a repeat of 2020, there are some important differences there too. We are now in a post January 6 landscape, and Trump is under multiple indictments, with trials or even convictions possible by the general election, all of which could potentially benefit Biden. On the other hand, Trump has been out of the public eye long enough, particularly given not being on X (formerly Twitter), and not participating in the primary debates, that the chaos which comes with a Trump presidency and which turned off some of his own voters is less salient. Also, Biden is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm in his own base. In addition to concerns about his age, many younger voters on the left are very unhappy with how he has handled the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dissatisfaction with both Trump and Biden as candidates could also draw a higher than usual third party vote, and I think RFK, Jr., who has an outsider appeal that draws from both left and right, is particularly important to watch.",,www.bu.edu,https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/bu-experts-weigh-on-nh-primary/

In total, Trump has been indicted for committing 91 felonies.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/

"One is that hardcore Trump supporters are convinced that the indictments are just further evidence of how far the Democratic Party is prepared to go to use the Justice Department, the FBI and other organs of the “deep state” against Trump.

"With Trump’s die-hard supporters having already discounted evidence of his unethical behavior, it is hard to imagine anything that might be revealed about his actions that would so shock his supporters as to make many of them turn away from him. A lot of Trump supporters who disdain his personal behavior say they will vote for him anyway because they like his ""Make America Great Again"" policies or because they dislike the Democrats’ big government, big-spending ways or because they believe Washington has become a cesspool of corruption that requires radical surgery that only Trump has the courage to perform.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/

DeSantis did not get the strong uptick in popular support from his performance at the first Republican debate this month that he needed to give new life to his lackluster campaign. For some on the stage, like the young Vivek Ramaswamy, the debate looked more like an audition to become Trump’s running mate. Short of facing a health crisis — not an insignificant concern for someone who is 77 years old, overweight, eats unhealthy food and doesn’t exercise — Trump is on track to be the GOP candidate in 2024.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/

In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National poll, for example, 41% of respondents said that the former president has done nothing illegal, a number that is down from 50% in June. Even if that number continues to go down, however, it is hard to see how any other Republican could become popular enough to deny Trump the nomination. All a weakening of Trump support will do is hurt his chances of winning the general election, which is what the Democrats are hoping for and why Republican leaders are wary of criticizing him.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/

"In a New York Times/Siena poll published on Aug. 1, Biden and Trump were tied at 43% support.

"In his campaign for president, Biden argued that the election was about saving the “soul” of America, replacing bitter division and partisanship with compromise and comity. But partisan divisions remain as deep as ever and “culture wars” about what to teach young children about the history of racism in the United States or about gender “choice” continue to be fought with undiminished intensity. Nor has Biden made any progress in coming up with a coherent policy to stem the flow of migrants across the southern border than the country did before he became president.

There is a much higher level of enthusiasm for Trump among the Republican base than there is for Biden among the Democratic Party’s rank and file. Trump’s supporters will turn out to vote in large numbers while many voters who are not enthusiastic about Biden might well decide to stay at home.

"In that case, and as the trial proceeds, his father will be confronted with uncomfortable questions about past actions that are bound to damage the Biden brand and the idea that his personal conduct is above reproach. Reports that Joe Biden, when he was vice president and then while Trump was in office, joined telephone conversations that Hunter had with executives of Burisma, the Ukrainian oil company, and with other foreign businessmen are bound to become fodder for an ever more intense Republican attack on the president.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/
"The Democratic Party has circled the wagons, dismissing accusations that Biden helped his son get millions of dollars in consulting fees from foreign businessmen. But one would have to be naive in the extreme to believe that Biden, in joining conference calls with Burisma executives, did not consider that he was lending his son a helping hand by impressing them with Hunter’s access to the powerful. It is impossible to know how much value a foreign company would place on being able to have a conversation with the president of the United States, even if only about the weather, but it is a safe assumption that it would be quite high.",,www.japantimes.co.jp,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/commentary/2023/08/29/world/trump-biden-candidacies/

Haley was governor of South Carolina during the Charleston shooting and gained national attention by urging lawmakers there to remove a Confederate flag from the state house grounds.

itting presidents do not tend to abandon bids for re-election. The most recent to do so was Lyndon Johnson, in 1968. And that is a year that his party, the Democrats, would rather forget. Johnson was unpopular. The country and the party were divided by the Vietnam war and the civil-rights movement. After a surprisingly strong challenge in the first primary, he stood aside, only to unleash chaos. One of the leading candidates to replace him, Robert Kennedy, was assassinated. The nomination was eventually awarded by party grandees to a man who had not won a single primary, Hubert Humphrey. In the end the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon, who had been widely considered unelectable at the beginning of the year, won convincingly. He went on to do more damage to the presidency than anyone bar the Republicans’ likely candidate this year, Donald Trump.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Mr Trump, too, should be unelectable, owing to the 91 felonies with which he has been charged in different parts of America. Yet Joe Biden, the incumbent president, is so unpopular he may well lose to Mr Trump. There have been occasional calls for Mr Biden to step aside, like Johnson. But there is no sign that he is willing to do so and no guarantee that the Democrats would end up with a stronger candidate if he did. For that reason, although many Democratic operatives have grave misgivings about his candidacy, most are keeping quiet. As one puts it, if you’re all stuck on a boat of questionable seaworthiness, it is natural to wish for a finer vessel, but unproductive to poke holes in the hull or stoke a mutiny.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"It is Mr Biden’s feeble polling that is seeding the angst. The Economist’s poll tracker for the Republican primary puts Mr Trump more than 50 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival, making him the prohibitive favourite. A polling average for the general election compiled by RealClearPolitics shows Mr Trump ahead of Mr Biden by a margin of 2.3 percentage points. This is well above his showing in the past two presidential contests, in which he consistently lagged in the polls. At this point in 2016 Mr Trump’s support was seven points lower: he trailed Hillary Clinton by a margin of five points. At this point in 2020 he trailed Mr Biden by five points.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"With most states so partisan that they are not worth contesting, the presidential campaign will be centred on six where the outcome is actually uncertain: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Early polling in these states also shows Mr Biden several points behind. And some Democrats fear that these polls may be underestimating Mr Trump’s support, because his conspiracy-minded voters may not be open with those taking the surveys.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Underpinning Mr Trump’s strength is a broad political shift. Partisan allegiance in America may seem hysterically entrenched, but in fact it is mutable. White working-class voters powered Mr Trump to victory in 2016; in the years since, the non-white working class has begun to shift, too. Between 2016 and 2020 Hispanic Americans, once fairly loyal Democratic voters, moved 18 points towards the Republicans. Black men are also slowly peeling away from the Democrats. Only the influx of white college graduates has kept the Democratic Party competitive nationally. These demographic trends are sizeable enough to determine the outcome of the election if they persist—and they do appear to be. The latest polls indicate higher support for Mr Trump among African-American and Hispanic voters than he enjoyed in 2020 (see chart 1). “It seems like the 2024 polls right now are 2020 trends carried forward,” says Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Secular trends aside, there is plainly a problem with Mr Biden himself. The president’s net approval rating is -16 points, according to several public polling averages. That is notably worse than Mr Trump’s at this point in his presidency. Voters are worried about his fitness for office. One of YouGov’s weekly polls for The Economist in December found that 55% of Americans think that the 81-year-old Mr Biden’s health and age “severely limit his ability to do the job” of president, including 25% of Democrats. Only 24% of Americans want him to run for president again. Fully 61% of them do not, including 38% of those who voted for him in 2020.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Americans are only marginally more enthusiastic about the 77-year-old Mr Trump’s revenge bid for the White House, but they are much less likely to think that he is too old or frail to resume the office. Mr Biden, after all, did not do much campaigning in 2020, owing to the pandemic. He does not seem to relish the arduous campaign ahead, whereas Mr Trump appears to like nothing better than rambling on in front of adoring crowds. Four years ago Mr Biden reportedly toyed with promising to remain in office for just a single term. “If Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running,” he said to a room full of donors in December. When asked how many other Democrats could beat Mr Trump, he said, “Probably 50 of them…I’m not the only one who could defeat him. But I will defeat him.”",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"There is almost no chance that Mr Biden will voluntarily abandon his re-election bid. He sees himself as a divinely appointed Trumpbuster and believes his electoral record reflects that. First he vanquished Mr Trump in 2020. Then in the midterm elections of 2022, when Republicans had expected to deliver a terrible rebuke to Democrats, the Democrats’ support held up surprisingly well.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Mr Biden’s supporters, naturally, express great confidence. “If you play poker, which I do, you’d rather have our cards than their cards,” says Jim Messina, the manager of Barack Obama’s successful re-election bid in 2012—although he admits, “This thing will be really close.” The campaign argues that the president has been underestimated before, as in the hotly contested Democratic primary of 2020, when he looked fatally unpopular before suddenly becoming the consensus candidate.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Campaign staffers point to the mid-terms as proof that Republican candidates who champion abortion and reject the election results of 2020 will fare poorly. They argue, correctly, that polls conducted ten months from an election are a poor guide to the outcome. Most voters will not devote much thought to the election for months and the billion-dollar campaign machines are only just gearing up. When Americans are paying more attention, the campaign insists, the spectacle of Mr Trump shuttling between rallies and court appearances will remind Americans of the chaos of his time in office.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Mr Biden’s polling deficit is not insurmountable. Bidenworld also thinks that, with time, voters will give the president more credit for his achievements. The labour market is robust, unemployment is low and wage growth is strongest at the bottom of the income distribution, reducing wage inequality. Inflation, which has infuriated many voters, is abating without a recession. YouGov’s polling for The Economist suggests Americans are unduly gloomy: 58% think the country has high unemployment (it does not); 44% think the country is in a recession (it is not); and 40% think inflation will be higher in six months (quite unlikely). The Democrats are hoping that voters will notice that the economy is doing better than they thought by election day. But Republicans keep talking about “Bidenomics” as a pejorative, suggesting that they doubt the topic will end up helping the president.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Mr Biden’s apologists also argue, in effect, that he will win because he must. “We’re going to win because democracy and freedom and the very ideas that make America America are on the line. We have no other choice,” says Quentin Fulks, his deputy campaign manager. They see a battle for the very “soul of the nation”, as Mr Biden often says. This is a stirring appeal, but only for the converted. A new study by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group finds that Americans like to invoke democratic norms to chide someone from the opposing party, but are willing to suspend them when it comes to their own preferred candidate. Mr Trump is also muddying things by deploying apocalyptic rhetoric of his own: he has recently taken to calling Mr Biden “the destroyer of American democracy”. Republicans in Congress may pursue a farcical impeachment inquiry against Mr Biden in order to claim that both men are equally disreputable.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Anyway, the end-of-days argument cuts both ways. It could be used to assert that the Democrats cannot risk as weak a candidate as Mr Biden. The party has plenty of non-geriatric politicians who could helm a presidential ticket. The problem is that none of them has dared to enter the primaries, in part for fear that they would not be able to beat Mr Biden and instead would only harm his chances in the general election. Only little-known politicians such as Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman from Minnesota, have put themselves forward. “President Biden—a man I respect and I think a person of decency and integrity—is perhaps one of the only Democrats who could lose and probably will lose to Donald Trump,” explains Mr Phillips. He says he is merely saying “the quiet part out loud” about the president’s advanced age and unpopularity.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"As reasonable as Mr Phillips’s criticisms may be, his challenge looks doomed (“keep the faith” is one of his catchphrases). He could score unexpectedly highly in the New Hampshire primary, to be held on January 23rd, which Mr Biden is boycotting over a scheduling spat within the Democratic Party. Thereafter, things will be harder. Some states, such as Florida, have in effect cancelled their Democratic primaries altogether, declaring that there is only one qualified candidate. The difficulty of getting on the ballot prompted Robert Kennedy junior, the son of the candidate assassinated in 1968, to abandon an attempt to stand in the primaries against Mr Biden and instead try to get on the ballot in the general election as a third-party candidate.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Even if more plausible candidates saw any hope of defeating Mr Biden, they are too late to initiate a serious primary challenge. The deadlines to file as a candidate in the primary have already passed in more than 20 states, and several more loom in early January. In recent years the primary calendar has become much more compressed: most of the almost 4,000 ordinary delegates will be allocated by the end of March (see chart 2), giving an insurgent candidate very little time to gain any momentum.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"All of which suggests that Mr Biden will easily secure his party’s nomination. It is possible, of course, that he might be forced to step aside by what pundits politely call a “health event”. But such an outcome would not necessarily be providential for the Democrats. As when Johnson declared in 1968, “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president”, pandemonium would probably follow. The party might have to rewrite the rules of the primaries, to allow more candidates late access to the ballot, but even so, the campaign would presumably be nasty, brutish and short. Only a few candidates, with the resources to crank up an electoral machine at short notice, would be able to compete.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Kamala Harris, the vice-president, would be the presumptive nominee, with the institutional support of the party behind her and perhaps even Mr Biden’s endorsement. Democrats are a hierarchical bunch. The last time they denied a vice-president seeking the presidential nomination was in 1952. The unfortunate man was Harry Truman’s deputy, Alben Barkley, a septuagenarian whose abysmal eyesight required documents to be set in inch-tall font.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"But Ms Harris, who ran a disastrous campaign for the presidency in 2020 that ended before the first votes were cast, would almost certainly attract challengers. Only 36% of Americans think she is qualified to be president, according to YouGov. Only 23% think she would beat Mr Trump (including 43% of those who voted for Mr Biden in 2020 and just 3% of Trump voters). Although it would be awkward in an identity-conscious party to attempt to step over the first black and the first female vice-president, some rivals would probably be willing to take the plunge.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b
"Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, is plainly clamouring for the chance to be president, although he denies it, and has built a formidable political machine. The governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, has both ambition and an inherited fortune worth billions. But the moderate governors whom many Democrats see as best-placed to take on Mr Trump—such as Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania or Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan—might not have enough money to hand to compete properly in a suddenly open primary or enough time to build a viable campaign. The biggest political talents in Mr Biden’s cabinet, such as Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, and Gina Raimondo, the secretary of commerce, would probably have to resign if they wanted to enter the fray. A coronation of Ms Harris might simply be unavoidable.",,www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/01/04/joe-bidens-chances-do-not-look-good-the-democrats-have-no-plan-b

"Nikki Haley, the last Republican challenger to Donald Trump, vowed to stay in the race for the GOP nomination Tuesday, saying she feels ""no need to kiss the ring."" ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"The former ambassador to the United Nations and governor of South Carolina said during a campaign stop in Greenville that she's ""far from"" dropping out of the race, regardless of an expected primary loss in her home state on Saturday. She said she would campaign ""until the last person votes,"" noting that only four states will have held their primary contests by Saturday. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"""Dropping out would be the easy route,"" she said. ""I've been the underdog in every race I've ever run. I've always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, I'm not just fighting someone bigger than me. I'm fighting for something bigger than myself."" ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"Haley's home turf hasn't translated into an advantage for her in the polls. Nearly two-thirds, 65%, of likely GOP primary voters said in a recent CBS News poll that they'd vote for Trump, with Haley trailing at 30%. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"Haley acknowledged the growing calls for her to drop out and her low polling against Trump, but argued that Trump has only secured high-profile endorsements because fellow Republicans fear him. A number of South Carolina Republicans, including Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Nancy Mace, whose careers were once helped by Haley's support, are backing Trump. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"""Many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him,"" she said. ""They know what a disaster he's been and will continue to be for our party.

",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"Haley escalated her attacks on the former president, saying she has ""no fear of Trump's retribution,"" isn't jockeying to be his vice president and that her ""political future is of zero concern."" ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"""He's gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than he does on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He's completely distracted, and everything is about him. He's so obsessed with his own demons from the past. He can't focus on delivering a future Americans deserve,"" Haley said. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"""He's taking out his anger on others. He's getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He's trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they'll be barred from MAGA permanently. That's not the way you win elections,"" she added. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"Before Haley's speech, Trump's campaign predicted ""the end is near for Nikki Haley"" in a memo sent to the press. The campaign characterized Haley as a ""wailing loser hell-bent on an alternative reality."" ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/
"While campaigning in the state earlier this month, Trump attacked Haley by mocking the absence of her husband, who is deployed with the South Carolina Army National Guard in Africa. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-announcement-2024-race-donald-trump-south-carolina/

"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fewer than four in 10 U.S. registered voters say President Joe Biden deserves to be reelected, while less than a quarter say the same about most members of the U.S. House. As is almost always the case, voters are more inclined to believe the U.S. representative from their own district should be returned to Congress, with 55% holding that view.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
These results are based on a Jan. 2-22 Gallup poll. The 38% of voters who say Biden deserves a second term is slightly lower than the 41% of Americans who approve of the job he is doing in the same survey.,,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Voters are somewhat more willing to say Biden should be returned to office now than they were when Gallup last asked the question in June 2022 (33%), leading up to that year’s midterm elections.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"As would be expected, the vast majority of Democratic registered voters (82%) versus few Republican voters (3%) believe Biden should be reelected. At 29%, independent voters’ support for a second Biden term is much closer to that of Republicans than Democrats.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Independents are the least likely party group to believe most members of Congress, and their own member, deserve to be reelected. Less than half of independents say their own representative should receive another term, compared with more than six in 10 Republicans and Democrats.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"In January of prior incumbent reelection years, Gallup asked whether former Presidents Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush deserved reelection. The same question was asked about George W. Bush (October 2003) and Barack Obama (December 2011) late in the years before they sought reelection.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Of these, the younger Bush (who won reelection) had the highest reelect figure, at 53%, while two incumbents who lost, Trump at 50% and the elder Bush at 49%, scored just below. Although Biden’s current rating ranks lowest among the readings for the past six presidents, his 38% is most similar to Clinton’s 44% and Obama’s 43%, both of whom won a second term.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
Biden can take some solace in the fact that voter sentiment about whether a president deserves reelection has often changed over the course of prior election years.,,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"After receiving subpar reelection support early on, Obama and Clinton saw significant improvement, resulting in election wins:",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Conversely, two presidents saw their promising early readings dwindle between January and Election Day, to the point that they lost their reelection bids:",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"The younger Bush’s reelection figures hovered around the 50% mark in three surveys leading up to the 2004 election, before he won a second term.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Today’s congressional reelection figures are also lower than is typical for early readings in presidential election years. Slightly fewer U.S. registered voters in 2012 and 2016 thought their local representative deserved to be reelected than do now, but 60% or more did so in other years.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"The 24% who believe most members deserve reelection is lower than in all recent presidential election years except 2012, when 20% held that view in the late 2011 survey. The current figure is similar to that from 2016, but in all other years, 35% or more thought most members should be reelected, including a majority of 56% in 2000.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Voters’ opinions of whether members of Congress deserve reelection have usually not changed much over the course of presidential election years. There have been exceptions, though -- as in 1992, when voters became much less inclined to want to reelect members, and in 2012, when there were modest increases in incumbent reelection sentiments.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"Voters are not enthusiastic about returning most elected federal officials to office. Biden trails other incumbents at similar points in their presidencies, and voters are less likely than in other recent election years to say members of Congress deserve reelection.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx
"While the numbers for Congress are unlikely to improve, based on historical patterns, Biden’s numbers could. He hopes to follow the paths of Clinton and Obama, whose electoral fortunes improved during their reelection years and saw them win second terms, rather than those of Trump and the elder George Bush, whose support for a second term deteriorated over the course of the election year.",,news.gallup.com,https://news.gallup.com/poll/609602/voters-biden-house-don-deserve-term.aspx

Trump has relentlessly promoted false claims that the election was rigged against him and he has savaged Republican elected officials he perceives as standing in the way of his quest to subvert the results.

"Sidney Powell, who was removed from Trump’s legal team last month, has teamed up with Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who is known for his representation of several high-profile clients, particularly in defamation cases.

"Trump has asked his supporters to get out and vote. The “seats are the last line of defence to save America and protect all that we’ve accomplished,” he said at the recent Georgia event.

"I believe that Joe Biden will most likely win reelection by a large or larger margin than in 2020. My reasoning? Well the economy, despite inflation, has seen an improvement since 2022 and now appears to be getting better (as far as I know and have researched). Trump has now faced multiple indictments and his ties to the January 6th insurrection and support for conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and his liability in a sexual assault case is enough to turn off quite a large portion of independent and undecided voters. Plus with things seemingly getting worse for Trump by the day I would honestly not be surprised if he dropped out sometime early next year.",,www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/
"The other republican candidates also don't have much traction and would likely be weak candidates against Biden in a general election. Ron DeSantis goes far too much into the ""woke"" crap and his anti-LGBT record will definitely make LGBT voters turn out in droves for Biden, Vivek Ramaswamy only gains traction with the far right and a majority of voters have never even heard of him, Mike Pence would dissapoint MAGA republicans due to him not supporting Trump, Chris Christie would also dissapoint MAGA and those voters would likely stay home.",,www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/

"I don't know. I really hope we don't get another Trump for 4 years. I believe for a democratic candidate to win, they need to get voters that don't normally vote out especially the younger generations. Talking to my Zoomer friends, they had a list of things they were excited to vote for (some universal higher education, public option, etc). My Zoomer friends aren't excited for Biden at all now. I don't know if Biden will excite the base enough to win again. Trump does rile up his base quite a bit. We will see though. I think it could go either way.",,www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/
"Well, it would be unjustifiable to say that he had a as high as 70% chance of winning. I’m assuming your definition of “extremely strong” lies somewhere between 50-70%?

"Biden would be 82 years old entering a new term, 86 years old at the end of the term. I think more and more Americans, even if they don't admit it publicly, don't feel that Biden has the strength and stamina to give the country what it needs to overcome a lot of the escalating issues. Dems are making a huge mistake by assuming voters will happily elect a lame duck president just because they are on the ballot and not Trump. And I think many conservatives, even if they don't publicly support Trump, feel the cultural pendulum has swung far enough to the left and will vote for anyone on the ballot to bring it back the other way. Maybe this will age poorly but I have strong conviction that Trump will win comfortably based on Biden's approval ratings, polling, and general sentiment I'm observing across different social networks across the political spectrum.",,www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/

"On this edition of Inside the Race Weekend, Politico White House Reporter Myah Ward and Politico Politics Reporter Brittany Gibson join Scripps News National Political correspondents, Haley Bull and Charles Benson, and host, Joe St. George to discuss if this presidential race may see a rise in popularity of third-party or independent candidates. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulling big numbers in Wisconsin in the latest polls, Benson highlighted the battleground states history with third-party candidates. Gibson, who specifically covers third-party candidates, said Kennedy has been polling better than a lot of recent third-party campaigns. One of his interesting strategies is focusing more on podcast interviews instead of traditional media interviews with local news outlets. Another big topic right now is the age of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Bidens memory was recently questioned after a report from Special Counsel Robert Hur claimed the 81-year-old president didnt remember when he was vice president or when his son Beau died of brain cancer.Bull said Biden has forcefully fought back against the claims his memory isnt good. Ward said it could make some voters stay home, with a lack of enthusiasm for candidates that dont connect with younger voters.

"What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most consequential global events since World War II, affecting virtually every country in the world. By the end of November 2020, more than 60 million people had contracted the virus and over one and a half million had died. In response to the pandemic, governments restricted citizens’ movement to varying degrees through lockdown measures, with the objective of slowing the spread of the disease. The pandemic contributed to severe economic contractions in most countries, increasing unemployment and poverty around the world.1",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In the USA, the COVID-19 pandemic struck during a presidential election year, shifting the political narrative and Trump’s re-election prospects. Prior to the pandemic, the US economy was performing well, and Trump, while extremely polarizing, enjoyed strong support among Republican voters.2 The virus changed the narrative and shaped the political campaign. As of the end of November 2020, the USA had suffered the largest numbers of cases (over 8 million) and deaths (over 220,000) in the world. Trump’s pandemic response, which contrasted with those of many leaders in other Western democracies, was repeatedly criticized by epidemiologists and scientists.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In this paper, we explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election. We investigate whether Trump’s electoral support fell in localities hit harder by the pandemic. Guided by a pre-analysis plan (PAP), which reduces concerns about data mining, we constructed a data set at the county-level, with the difference in vote share for Trump between the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections as our dependent variable.3 Our main independent variable is COVID-19 cases, which we gather from the data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In our estimates, we control for social distancing and four occupational measures: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. In addition, we account for demographic and socioeconomic variables and for changes in unemployment between August 2019 and August 2020. In placebo tests, we show that COVID-19 incidence is uncorrelated with changes in Republican candidates vote share in previous elections, e.g., votes for Trump in 2016 compared with votes for Romney in 2012.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In an attempt to sharpen our identification strategy, we instrument COVID-19 cases with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. We show that counties with a larger share of workers employed in meat-processing factories experienced a significantly larger number of cases than counties with a smaller share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. Our two-stage least squares estimates also control for the share of manufacturing workers and the share of food manufacturing workers in each county as well as for counties’ vulnerability to Trump’s trade policies in an effort to validate the exclusion restriction.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Our results indicate that COVID-19 cases had a significant negative effect on the Trump vote share in the 2020 presidential election (in comparison to 2016). This finding holds in both the reduced form analysis and the instrumental variable analysis. We also find potentially important heterogeneity in the effect of COVID-19. In particular, the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a formal stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that the change in the unemployment rate is related to electoral support for Trump. There is some evidence that COVID-19 cases affect voters’ mobilization, measured as the number of votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"These effects not only are significant and robust to many robustness checks but they are also quite sizable. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if the number of COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin—likely resulting in his re-election.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Our paper is related to several streams of the literature on political behavior and political economy.4 First, our paper speaks to the literature on retrospective voting, which examines how citizens evaluate and vote based on their perceptions of the incumbent’s performance (Fiorina 1981; Ferejohn 1986; Persson et al. 1997; Fearon 1999; Canes-Wrone et al. 2001; Ashworth 2012). Our findings indicate that voters assess the competence of political leaders in the case of a pandemic and hold them accountable for rising numbers of cases and deaths. This is consistent with evidence in Herrera et al. (2020), who find in a sample of 35 countries that approval of incumbent politicians falls as COVID-19 cases grow, as well as Gutierrez et al. (2020), who find that voters punished the incumbent government following the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Second, our paper is related to a literature that links shocks such as natural disasters to political behavior (Abney and Hill 1966; Chen 2012; Malhotra and Kuo 2008; Bechtel and Hainmueller 2011). The logic of this literature is similar to that of retrospective voting. Rational voters reward incumbents not only for delivering a positive economic performance in good times but also for organizing prompt rescue and relief programs in bad times, such as in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Our findings indicate that incumbent governments are punished electorally for failing to provide effective mitigation and relief, even if the primary shock (in this case, a virus) is not directly attributable to them.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Third, our paper speaks to the literature on the effect of personally experiencing shocks (e.g., crises and wars) on political and social attitudes (Lau et al. 1978; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981; Erikson and Stoker 2001; Mo and Conn 2018). Our findings are consistent with studies showing that negative economic shocks increase support for government intervention in the economy and redistributive policies as well as people’s beliefs about the relative importance of luck versus effort (Margalit 2013; Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014). These changes in voters’ preferences and beliefs are consistent with increasing support for a Democratic candidate over an incumbent Republican president in the midst of a pandemic.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Finally, our paper also relates to a growing literature on the pandemic. For instance, Allcott et al. (2020) rely on smartphone data and provide evidence that areas with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing. Baccini and Brodeur (2020) show that Democratic governors and governors without a term limit are significantly faster (and more likely) to adopt stay-at-home orders than Republican governors and governors with a term limit. Warshaw et al. (2020) demonstrate that states and local areas with relatively more COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support Republican House and Senate candidates. Other papers have explored related issues, such as policy responses and social distancing, in other countries such China and Italy (Qiu et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021; Milani 2021).",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"News of a novel coronavirus made global headlines beginning in January 2020. On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a coronavirus-type pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began screening at three major US airports on January 20, and the first US coronavirus case was confirmed the following day. On January 23, China made the unprecedented move of quarantining Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The white House announced on January 31 a travel ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to China within the past 14 days. The first US death from the disease occurred on February 29 in Washington State.5",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. That same day the US National Basketball Association suspended all games, and the actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for the virus in Australia. Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, unlocking up to $50 billion dollars in federal funding to combat the spread of the disease, the same day on which several states announced school closures. On March 19, California became the first state to issue a “stay-at-home” order, with exceptions for work and shopping for essential needs. On March 26, Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which provided $2 trillion in aid to businesses, hospitals, and local governments.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"While no country was unaffected, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the USA particularly hard. The US COVID-19 death toll passed the grim mark of 100,000 on May 28; by September 22, 200,000 American lives had been lost. Measured on a per capita basis, only Brazil, Spain, and Mexico have recorded higher death rates among large countries.6 Along with lost lives, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the USA exerted a profound economic impact. Increasing numbers of cases caused changes in consumer behavior, with large drops in consumption of services (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020) leading to an unprecedented increase in unemployment (Chetty et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020). The economic downturn coincided with changing political attitudes about the role of government, with Rees-Jones et al. (2020a) finding deaths and infections associated with increased support for expanding the US safety net.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In sharp contrast to most world leaders and to his opponent Joe Biden, Trump sought to downplay the threat of the virus, with limited political success. He began this tactic early in the crisis, and never veered from it. On February 10, Trump claimed, “a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat...” On February 26, as US cases began to appear, he said, “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Again, on April 3, he remarked, “It is going to go away. It is going away.” He continued making similar comments throughout the summer, and in his first remarks after contracting the virus himself in October, he declared, “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”7 The tactic did little to help his standing with the electorate. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating fell from a 2020 high of 49% on March 22 to 38% on June 30.8 Polls showed nearly 60% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s response to the pandemic, with very little variation in the 5 months leading up to the election.9",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"There are several reasons to believe that the pandemic and the Trump administration’s response were detrimental to Trump’s reelection prospects. The strong disapproval of the president’s handling of the virus suggests that a majority of the public blamed the administration for its failure to curtail its spread. Most importantly, voters likely associate rising local cases and deaths with an increasing threat to the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. In this context, we might expect that the greater the local exposure to risk, the more likely voters are to punish the president by voting for the challenger. Another channel through which COVID-19 may have lead to diminished Trump support is economic. Despite a big rebound in economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate remains well above the historical average. Ominously, rising case numbers in the lead-up to the election portended another wave of hospitalizations and deaths—and the prospect of more localized lockdowns, business closures, and a double-dip recession. Both retrospective and prospective voting frameworks suggest that voters are likely to hold the president accountable for the toll of the virus. For these reasons, we examine whether more severe local outbreaks are associated with weaker support for Trump in 2020, compared to the 2016 presidential election.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"There is, however, a counter-argument to be made. A possible interpretation of Trump’s strategy in responding to the pandemic is that it was in line with the preferences of his core constituents. Survey data reveal a striking difference in attitudes toward the pandemic between Democratic and Republican voters. According to Gallup, only 25% of Republican respondents are “worried about getting the coronavirus,” whereas this percentage climbs to almost 80% among Democratic respondents.10 Similarly, about 60% of Republican respondents are “ready to return to normal activities right now,” whereas a mere 3% of Democratic respondents are ready to resume a normal lifestyle. We see similar differences for questions related to practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. While ideology influences attitudes toward the pandemic in other countries as well, the differences between Democratic and Republican voters in the USA are uniquely large. In short, given the polarization of US politics, voters seem to be experiencing the very same event in very different ways based on their partisan identities. If this is the case, even a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths may not meaningfully reduce support for Trump, especially among his base.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"In this section, we describe the empirical strategy that was pre-specified in a PAP.

"As stated in our PAP, we first rely on the following model:",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"where Yc is the differential in Trump’s vote share in 2020 and 2016 for county c. COVIDIncidencec is the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants as of October 22, 2020.15 We report standard errors clustered at the state-level.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"We include in the model Xc, which is a vector of county-level variables. We include the following demographic and socioeconomic variables: population, share of female population, share of foreign-born population, share of population with a college degree, share of non-Hispanic Black population, share of non-Hispanic white population, share of population by age group (9 dummies), social mobility index, and four occupational indexes. Moreover, we compute employment changes due to the pandemic at the county-level by taking the unemployment rate as of September 2020 minus the unemployment rate as of September 2019.16 The inclusion of these variables is key to our identification assumption that no omitted variables are related to COVID-19 incidence and the change in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election. Finally, 𝜃s represents state fixed effects. This set of fixed effects allows us to further control for county-level characteristics that are common to counties within the same state.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Our estimation is thus at the county-level and we effectively test whether counties with relatively more COVID-19 cases or deaths differentially voted for the Trump in 2020 compared with the previous presidential election. We use this model instead of a model relating COVID-19 incidence to vote share in 2020 alone to better capture trends in voting behavior. In other words, we compare how voting behavior changed pre- and post-COVID-19 rather than simply analyzing voting behavior post-COVID-19. We believe this is crucial in this context given the increasing political polarization in the USA. Moreover, we think that the inclusion of state fixed effects and controlling for social distancing and a large set of demographic variables helps account for differential (changes in) behavior and preferences across counties. This is also crucial because a growing literature has shown, for instance, that individuals identifying as Republicans are less likely to comply with social distancing orders than those identifying as Democrats (e.g., Allcott et al. 2020; Gollwitzer et al.2020).",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"We complement the reduced form analysis with an instrumental variable approach. The concern we attempt to address is that COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths do not occur at random, but rather they correlate with individuals’ behavior, which may be different between those who vote for the Democratic Party and those who vote for the Republican Party. For instance, it may be that voters living in “red” (i.e., Republican-leaning) counties are less likely to observe social distancing or to wear masks. If this is the case, this type of behavior would be likely to increase the number of COVID-19 cases (and in turn COVID-19 deaths) and we would observe a larger share of votes for Trump than for Biden in the same counties. While we control for social distancing in the previous analysis, we may have missed some other confounders in our analysis.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"To attempt to achieve exogenous variation of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county-level, we instrument COVID-19 cases and deaths with the share of employment in meat-processing factories in each county. More specifically, we use the average number of workers in the NAICS industry code 3116, “Animal Slaughtering and Processing,” in each county between 2012 and 2015, i.e., before Trump’s presidency. We divide this number by the average number of total workers in each country during the same time frame, i.e., 2012–2015. Data come from the CBP and measure raw employment.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"The rationale for the instrument is that there is evidence of meat-processing plants becoming COVID-19 hotbeds due to their cold, humid environment and difficulties with workplace physical distancing.17 According to a CDC report on July 10, among 23 states reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and poultry facilities, 16,233 cases in 239 facilities occurred, including 86 (0.5%) COVID-19-related deaths.18 Based on cases reported by Johns Hopkins University, as of May 6, counties containing or within 15 miles of one or more meatpacking plants reported 373 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents.19 That is roughly double the US average of 199 cases per 100,000 in all counties with reported cases.20 The severity of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in meat-processing facilities prompted research on how to control the spread of the virus in these plants.21",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Armed with this instrument, we estimate:",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"where MEATc is the share of workers in meat-processing plants. We run a first stage in which we regress this variable on the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants at the county level, including all controls and state fixed effects as in Eq. 1. Then we plug in the predicted values of this first stage and estimate the second stage of the 2SLS.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"For our instrument to be valid two conditions have to hold. First, our instrument has to be a strong predictor of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories since the beginning of the pandemic for the (1) top 1% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories. This figure illustrates the cumulative number of number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories for the (1) top 1% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. Employment data is from the County Business Patterns",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
This figure provides direct evidence that counties with a higher share of employment in meat-processing factories had a higher incidence of COVID-19 during the entire pandemic. COVID-19 case (and death) incidence is much larger for counties with a relatively high share of employment in meat-processing factories and much smaller for counties with no employment or positive employment share. This result suggests our first stage is strong and that the relationship between the share of employment in meat-processing factories and COVID-19 incidence is non-linear.,,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Note also that the raw correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument is 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. The correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument conditional on controls and state fixed effect is much higher, i.e., above 0.5 for cases and 0.3 for deaths.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Second, the identifying variance is the industrial composition of each county, specifically the presence of meat-processing factories. In order for our instrument to allow a causal interpretation, employment in meat-processing factories must only affect the change in voting behavior from 2016 to 2020 through its effect on COVID-19 cases and deaths, i.e., the exogeneity assumption. While there is no test to assess the validity of this assumption, we discuss other possible channels through which our instrument can affect the outcome variable and explain how we account for these channels. While we control for a host of variables that could potentially affect the exclusion restriction, we discuss here two main possible violations of the exogeneity assumption.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"First, we control for the share of manufacturing employment. We do so because it may be that counties with a large share of workers in manufacturing voted against Trump in 2020 due to job losses for which he was now held accountable as the incumbent president. It may also be that trade unions were more actively campaigning against Trump in 2020 than they were in 2016, since he was the incumbent Republican president. In an effort to isolate the effect of our instrument on COVID-19 cases, we also include the share of workers in food manufacturing, i.e., NAICS industry code 311, to which “Animal Slaughtering and Processing” belongs. Including this variable implies that every possible violation of the exclusion restriction has to be specific to the meat-processing industry.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In the same spirit, we are concern that Trump policies—both those related and those unrelated to trade—did not specifically affect meat packaging industry. We thus include the China trade shock variable, which captures the vulnerability of US manufacturing counties to foreign competition especially from China.22Autor et al. (2020) show that the China trade shock increased Trump’s vote in 2016 and, in the same vein, it could have decreased his electoral support in 2020 as the incumbent president.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Second, it may be that Trump’s trade policies have negatively affected meat sales, and in turn this could have led to a loss of support among workers in this industry and in surrounding communities. Kim and Margalit (2021) provide evidence of that. For addressing this concern, we include variables capturing the potential impact of Chinese tariffs and US tariffs on the workforce in each county.23",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Note also that the correlation between our instrument and the share of manufacturing employment and share of employment in food manufacturing is 0.3 and 0.4 respectively, whereas the correlation between our instrument and the other controls is never higher than 0.1.24",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In Appendix Table 8, we provide empirical evidence that COVID-19 incidence is significantly related to votes for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

"What clearly emerges is that COVID-19 cases are negatively related to votes for Trump during the 2020 presidential election in comparison to the 2016 election. In column 1, we include state fixed effects and our set of demographic and socioeconomic controls. We find that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 0.12 percentage points on average. The point estimate is statistically significant at about the 10% level.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"In column 2, we add to the model our indicator of social distancing, i.e., time spent at workplaces in April 2020. Column 3 is our most extensive model specification.

"In column 4, we add to the model a quadratic term of COVID-19 cases. The quadratic term of COVID-19 cases is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level, but very small in magnitude (6.10e-08). In contrast, the magnitude and sign of the coefficient of our variable of interest, cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000, remain the same. This result suggests that the negative effect of additional COVID-19 cases on Trump’s 2020 vote share becomes slightly smaller as the number of cases increases.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Of note, the coefficient of unemployment change (August 2019 to August 2020) is small and statistically insignificant.27 Our results thus suggest that job losses during the pandemic are not significantly related to voting behavior and that increases in the unemployment rate does not seem to be a major factor behind the negative effect of COVID-19 on the share of votes for Trump. A possible explanation is that job losses are triggered by policies, e.g., lockdowns, implemented by the states, which Trump opposed or at the very least for which Trump cannot be held directly responsible.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"The coefficients for some of the other control variables are worth discussing (not shown for space consideration).

Our OLS results provide suggestive evidence that the pandemic affected the 2020 presidential election. The main concern with our OLS estimates is that omitted variables could be related to both COVID-19 incidence and differential voting behavior in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.

"So far, our analysis has underscored an important finding: the COVID-19 pandemic costs Trump votes. But is this effect large enough to have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election? To answer this question, we conduct a simple counterfactual exercise to determine the magnitude of the effect by exploring how the composition of votes in a number of closely contested states would have differed if there had been fewer COVID-19 cases. The computation of the counterfactual is based on the coefficient estimate in column 1 of Table 2. For each county, we compute the fraction of total votes that Trump would have received if the number of COVID-19 cases had been X% smaller as − 0.0012 ×COVIDc × X% – i.e., the point estimate of the effect of COVIDc on Trump’s vote share from the OLS estimates, the size of each county’s measured COVID-19 cases, and the scaling factor X%. We next multiply this product by the number of total votes in a county to calculate the number of additional votes that Trump would have received in the counterfactual scenario. We then aggregate these county-level votes into state totals. To allow for the margin of error in our counterfactual calculations, we use the lower and upper bounds of our estimate (i.e., 0.0012), using the 90% confidence interval. We report these bounds in parenthesis.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Table 3 presents the results of this counterfactual analysis. Column 1 shows the actual vote margin in favor of Biden in the 2020 election for a set of closely contested states. The three subsequent columns show counterfactual outcomes had COVID-19 cases been 5% or 10% or 20% fewer. Since we find that the COVID incidence decreased Trump’s vote share, the counterfactual analyses for fewer COVID-19 cases correspondingly increase Trump’s counterfactual vote totals. The results in Table 3 show that, ceteris paribus, Trump would have won Michigan in a counterfactual scenario with 20% fewer cases. Trump would have won Pennsylvania with 10% fewer COVID-19 cases. He would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, with 5% fewer COVID-19 cases. Under this last counterfactual, Trump would have been reelected. Even if we consider the lower bound calculations, which are very conservative, Trump would have kept the presidency with 21% fewer cases.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"The computation of the counterfactual is based on the estimate from the OLS model. An increase in per COVID-19 cases reduces Trump’s share of vote by 0.0012 percentage points (see column 3 in Table 2). The actual outcome in column 2 reports the margin in favor of Biden in each state. Negative values indicate that Biden won the state in 2020. The reported values in columns 3 and 4 are estimated margins in favor of Trump in the counterfactual scenario of fewer COVID-19 cases. The numbers in parentheses are the lower and upper bound on these calculations, using the 90% confidence intervals of our OLS estimate. A positive value in columns 3 or 4 larger than the negative value in column 2 implies that Trump would have won the state",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"We investigate heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 on voting in Table 4. In columns 1 and 2, we first investigate whether the effect of COVID-19 incidence is larger/smaller for states that have implemented a stay-at-home order than for states that did not implement such a policy during the pandemic. Data on stay-at-home order comes from Raifman et al. (2020) and only include directives/orders for the entire state, i.e., did not include guidance or recommendations. Of note, all states without a stay-at-home order are states that Trump won in 2016. Our 2SLS estimates suggest that COVID-19 had a larger effect in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order during the pandemic. This result seems to suggest that if Trump had taken the pandemic more seriously and had placed more emphasis on health and safety issues, he would have lost less electorally and he would have had higher chances to get re-elected.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

The magnitude of the coefficient is about 50% larger than the magnitude of the coefficient in the entire sample.30 In contrast, the coefficient of COVID-19 cases is small, positive, and not significant in those states that Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election (column 2).31",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"The fact that our 2SLS estimates are of about the same magnitude for cases and deaths suggests that our conclusions are similar when using deaths instead of cases. Nonetheless, two differences are worth mentioning. First, our instrumental variable is only weakly related to COVID-19 deaths.33 The probability that a COVID-19 infection results in death rises dramatically with age, and we expect that this and other factors such as healthcare coverage may contribute to the divergence in estimated effects. Second, it is plausible that voters are less aware or less likely to know someone who has died of COVID-19 than to know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"We provide many robustness checks for our 2SLS results in Baccini et al. (2020). For instance, we add to the models well-known predictors of voting behavior or COVID-19 incidence. We show that our results are robust to controlling for the China shock variable (Autor et al. (2020)) and two variables capturing Chinese tariffs and protection by US tariffs at the county-level from Kim and Margalit (2021). The rationale for including these variables has been explained in the previous section.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"We also check whether our OLS and 2SLS point estimates vary if we change the date for the moment in which we calculate the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. As stated in our pre-analysis plan, we rely on October 22nd for our main analysis. In a set of robustness checks, we instead rely on July 1st, August 1st, September 1st, and August 1st. The estimates for the OLS are all larger and more significant than for our baseline, i.e., cases as of October 22nd, suggesting that we are very conservative in estimating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the differential in votes for Trump. For the 2SLS, the point estimates all range from − 0.011 to − 0.013 and are statistically significant at the 1% level. Similarly, changing the start period to April or May, i.e., excluding cases that occurred early on in the pandemic, has no impact on our conclusions.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Last, we show that our conclusions are robust to using a different geographical level for the analysis. In Baccini et al. (2020), we replicate our main analysis using commuting zones as our unit of analysis. Commuting zones are significantly larger than counties, which provides the advantage that the distribution of employment in the meat-processing industry is less limited geographically, since many commuting zones have at least one meat-processing factory.39",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"This paper explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election using both a reduced form and IV approach. Our key finding is that COVID-19 cases decreased electoral support for Trump. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have been reelected. We find that the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential elections, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that worsening economic conditions reduced electoral support for Trump. The 2SLS estimates show evidence that COVID-19 cases affect positively voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"At least two explanations are consistent with these findings. First, voters may have electorally sanctioned Trump for how he handled the pandemic, which was at odds with most major countries, and widely criticized. This explanation is consistent with a retrospective voting approach (Fiorina 1981; Fearon 1999; Norpoth 2001), in which voters sanction incumbents for their handling of negative shocks. Second, some voters may have switched from Trump to Biden due to changes in preferences triggered by the pandemic and the recession. In particular, a severe public health threat and major economic losses may have shifted preferences in favor of an expansion of the social safety net, including healthcare and unemployment insurance programs (Rees-Jones et al. 2020b). Since the Democratic Party is more likely to champion these policies, Biden benefited from this switch in voters’ preferences. This explanation is in line with studies claiming that political preferences are shaped by personal experience. If it is true that these changes in preferences are long lasting (Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014), the Democratic Party may be able to capitalize electorally in future elections.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
"Our empirical analysis is unable to tease out which of these two channels is operative; this remains an important task for future research. Future studies should also explore how turnout, which was quite high for the 2020 presidential election but for which granular data is not yet available, influenced the results reported in this paper. Finally, when individual-level survey data become available, it will be important to explore how voter heterogeneity in race, age, and other characteristics conditions voters’ responses to the pandemic.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

The over-time variation is given by the difference in imports from China to the USA between 2000 (i.e., pre-accession to the WTO) to the period 2016–2019 (i.e., average value over this 4-year window).",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/
23These variables are built by matching the list of targeted commodities (by China and the USA) to industry classifications and constructing an original measure of the county-level share of employment targeted in each round of retaliatory tariffs.

"24We also implemented the plausibly exogenous test as suggested by Conley et al. (2012). The result of the test, which is available upon request, shows that our instrument is plausibly exogenous with p < 0.1.

"27Using the change in unemployment for different dates does not affect our conclusions.

"28There are many plausible explanations for why our 2SLS estimates are larger than our OLS estimates. First, there is a great deal of measurement error in our estimation. Second, we are estimating a local average treatment effect (LATE) with our IV estimation. Voting behavior in counties with relatively more employment in meat-processing factories may be differently affected by the pandemic than counties with no or a small share of employment in this industry. For instance, counties with employment in meat-processing factories are significantly more populous than counties without any jobs in this industry.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

"31We also tested the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in red states, for states with and without stay-at-home order. Our 2SLS estimates suggest a large negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote for both sets of red states, but that the effect is larger for states without stay-at-home orders.",,www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809554/

35We also investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases on the number of votes for Trump and the Democratic Party separately. The estimates are presented in Baccini et al. (2020). We do not find evidence that COVID-19 is related to the number of votes for Trump in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our OLS and 2SLS models.

"President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has plenty of people to thank for his election win over incumbent President Donald Trump. But voting data shows he should be especially grateful for the support of young voters—in particular, young voters of color.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"Nationwide, 61 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for Biden, while 36 percent voted for Trump, according to analysis from the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), the non-partisan research center on youth engagement at Tufts University’s Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life. That’s higher than the level of youth support Hillary Clinton received from young voters in 2016. About half of eligible 18- to 29-year-olds voted, and CIRCLE projects that could rise to 56 percent when all votes are counted.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"Across the country, young voters of color overwhelmingly cast ballots for Biden, including 87 percent of young Black voters, 83 percent of young Asian voters, and 73 percent of young Latino voters. The white youth vote also favored Biden, but much more narrowly, at 51 percent.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"“During this election cycle, as young people are raising their voices, advocating for change, and voting in historic numbers, CIRCLE’s research has provided the essential data and analyses that help us all see and understand the importance of young people to our nation’s civic life and their impact on the future of our democracy,” said Alan D.

A deeper dive into CIRCLE’s data reveals more striking points.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"In Georgia, about 57 percent of young voters favored Biden over Trump, giving the Democratic candidate a razor-thin lead over Trump in the traditionally red state. Among young voters of color in Georgia, Biden’s lead was much wider: 90 percent of young Black voters chose Biden.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"Of Michigan voters ages 18 to 29, 62 percent chose Biden and 35 percent went for Trump, giving Biden an edge of about 194,000 youth votes—higher than the 148,000-vote margin of victory in the state. About 77 percent of Michigan’s young voters of color cast ballots for Biden.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"“Young people’s activism, participation, and leadership in this election have been historic, with young people of color playing an especially critical role,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, Director of Tisch College’s CIRCLE. “Our data reveal that youth cast more than 10 million early and absentee ballots, and possibly upwards of 25 million ballots in total, turning out at a higher rate than in recent elections.”",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
Many young voters cited the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for their decision. A CIRCLE analysis found that more than half (52 percent) of 18- to 29-year-olds said they or someone in their home lost a job or had reduced pay due to COVID-19. Those voters favored Biden by a 33-point margin.,,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"About one out of five young people said they’ve lost a friend or family member to the virus, and that number is higher among youth of color, whose communities have suffered more case numbers and deaths from COVID-19 than white communities. Support for Biden was even higher among young voters who know someone who died of COVID-19. ",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"“Even at this time of so much uncertainty, when the nation is confronting a pandemic, widespread economic hardship, and systemic racism, young people voted in large numbers across the country—and powered the Biden-Harris ticket to victory,” said Kawashima-Ginsberg.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"While many young voters made sure to cast their ballot, not all of them expressed confidence that it would be counted properly. A CIRCLE analysis of election data found that a majority of young voters had at least some doubts about the electoral process: 73 percent of young white voters and 68 percent of young voters of color were either “not too confident” or “somewhat confident” that votes would be counted accurately.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"Voters ages 18-29 also worried about interference from other countries in this election, CIRCLE’s analysis showed. About 44 percent of youth voters of color said they were “very concerned” that this interference would affect the presidential election results.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win
"However, young voters were more optimistic about other parts of the electoral process. More than three out of four young people said they were somewhat or very confident that eligible voters would be allowed to cast a ballot, and those voters were similarly confident that voter fraud would not be an issue.",,now.tufts.edu,https://now.tufts.edu/2020/11/12/young-voters-were-crucial-bidens-win

"I am deeply grateful for the enormous contributions President Joe Biden has made to restoring the American government. He has accomplished a great deal.

"If you’ve lived through the last five years and haven’t been forced to medicate yourself to the point of unconsciousness, you’re probably aware that Donald Trump has been very bad for society, on account of the racism and the corruption and the mass casualties and the general, ongoing assault on democracy. Because of that, it would be ideal if neither the 45th president nor his acolytes sat at the seat of power ever again, though, unfortunately, that’s no sure thing. For one thing, Republicans have a shot at flipping the Senate in 2022, and there are a disturbing number of GOP lawmakers there whom Trump has wrapped around his morally bankrupt finger. For another, Trump is reportedly “laying the groundwork” for a 2024 run, and if you recall, 74 million people inexplicably voted for him in 2020, which wasn’t enough to actually win but was a disturbing number nevertheless.",,www.vanityfair.com,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/donald-trump-tells-supporters-not-to-vote
"Obviously also at issue is that since Trump lost to Joe Biden, Republicans have responded by attempting to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible. Allies of the former guy have been paving the way to meddle in future elections by passing bills that “allow Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds,” which would, per The Atlantic, let state legislatures or their appointees interfere “in local decision-making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona, Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020: throw out ballots in rival strongholds in order to overturn a statewide result.” Which is bone-chillingly terrifying.",,www.vanityfair.com,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/donald-trump-tells-supporters-not-to-vote

"But you know what would be great? If somehow we could wave a magic wand and ensure that none of the people who support Trump or Trump-endorsed candidates show up to vote, which would be a tremendous turn of events for humanity, though one that would clearly never happen unless—what? What’s that you say? Donald Trump has, in an incredible self-own, told his base to stay home and not vote in the next two elections?",,www.vanityfair.com,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/donald-trump-tells-supporters-not-to-vote

"Setting aside for a moment the idea of Trump instructing millions of people not to vote, which would have the obvious effect of helping the other side, it’s important to note that Trump is still—still!—clinging to the idea that the 2020 election was stolen and there is a chance it could be overturned and he could be “reinstated” at the White House. That’s extremely scary because, in case anyone missed it the first thousand times, there is absolutely zero evidence that fraud played a role in the last election, despite multiple attempts by conservatives to conduct “audits” of results in battleground states, which have thus far only proven how badly Trump lost.",,www.vanityfair.com,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/donald-trump-tells-supporters-not-to-vote
"Nevertheless, we absolutely love the idea of Trump throwing a hissy fit and saying, “Oh yeah? You won’t overturn Joe Biden’s win? My people will show you!” First, because it underscores how very, very stupid he is, and second, because he and his allies have done this in the past and it predictably worked out great for Democrats.",,www.vanityfair.com,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/donald-trump-tells-supporters-not-to-vote

"election night in 2016, my six-year-old daughter and I wore matching “feminist” T-shirts, ordered a pizza, and sat glued in front of the television with my mother.

But I’m still furious: I can’t believe that when faced with the most dangerous president of our lifetime, Democrats are moving ahead with a nearly 80-year-old moderate who has shown himself time and again not up for the fight.

"Most of all, I’m angry that people who want Trump out are expected to just vote without airing our concerns about the man who stands between him and another four years. I understand the deep worry so many Democrats share about fighting Trump with anything less than full-throated enthusiasm for our candidate. The consequences of losing another election — more far-right Supreme Court justices appointed, more children separated from their parents at the border, more hate crimes, and more lives and jobs lost amid this mismanaged pandemic — are real and terrifying.

,,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Joe Biden, President of the United States, served as Vice President from 2009 to 2017 and in the United States Senate from 1973 until 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, he made his second presidential run in 2008, later being announced as Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate in 2008. He was elected vice president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. In April 2019, Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign.[1] He became the presumptive Democratic nominee in April 2020,[2] was formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August 2020,[3] and defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.[4]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Over his career, Biden has generally been regarded as belonging to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.[5][6] Biden has been described as center[7][8][9] to center-left[10] and has described himself as the latter.[11] Figures farther to the left such as Bernie Sanders have criticized Biden for not embracing Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Biden's policies emphasize the needs of middle-class and working-class Americans[12] and have drawn political support from those groups.[13] Biden has supported campaign finance reform including the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and overturning Citizens United;[14][15] the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act;[16] the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[17][18] student tax credits;[19] carbon emissions cap and trade;[20] the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration;[18] mass transit;[21] renewable energy subsidies;[20] student loan forgiveness;[22] and reversals of Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.[23][12][24] He supports building upon the Affordable Care Act through a public health insurance option instead of a single-payer system.[25][26] He supports decriminalizing cannabis at the federal level and the right for states to legalize it.[27] Biden has been publicly in favor of same-sex marriage since 2012 when he became the highest-ranking U.S. official to voice support for same-sex marriage, preempting Obama on the subject.[28] He also supports the Roe v. Wade decision and since 2019 has been in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.[29][30]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In a 2019 article about Biden's record on abortion, his press secretary Jamal Brown said that when Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 he thought Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, but now ""firmly believes that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and should not be overturned"". In 1981, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe v. Wade. In 1982, he voted against the same failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe, and in 2006, he stated in an interview that ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy[.]""[31] He now says he would consider codifying the Roe precedent into federal law in case the United States Supreme Court overturns the ruling.[32][33] He pledged that he would appoint United States Supreme Court justices who shared his beliefs in upholding Roe.[34]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"From 1976 to June 5, 2019, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment.[35][36] On June 6, 2019, Biden reversed his support and now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment.[37] In 1981, he voted to end federal funding for abortion for victims of rape and incest.[32] Biden previously supported the Mexico City policy, but now supports repealing it.[33]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In 2003, Biden voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.[38] In 2007, he opposed the United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart which upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. He defended his opposition, saying he opposed the court's reasoning for the ruling, not the decision itself.[39]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's leading opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[40]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In his first Senate campaign, Biden expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[41] In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment.[42]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Later, Biden was heckled when he told a meeting of Delaware parents that his position on busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions.[further explanation needed][43] This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with anti-busing senators.[40] In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;[44] he said busing was a ""bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense"" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[45] At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities, and voting rights.[42] In 1977 Biden then voted against integration stating he did not want his children going to school in a ""racial jungle"". Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1978.[46]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

"Since June 20, 2019, Biden opposes capital punishment. Biden supports legislation to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and incentivize states to abolish capital punishment. He supports individuals on death row instead serving life sentences without probation or parole.[48][49] Prior to June 20, 2019, he had supported capital punishment. He originally wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act included Title VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, creating 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes,[50] for crimes related to acts of terrorism, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death. However, he voted against limiting appeals in capital cases and also opposed rejecting racial statistics in death penalty appeals.[citation needed]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden helped author the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which deployed and trained more police officers, increased prison sentences, and built more prisons. The bill led to a decrease in crime rates[citation needed] while also introducing the Violence Against Women Act. Part of the bill was an assault weapon ban and additional money was redirected towards crime prevention programs. Some critics say that the law had the unintended by-effect of creating a financial incentive for jailing people and keeping them there for longer periods of time; this had a disproportionate impact on minorities.[51]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a slogan of ""defund the police"" arose, which some interpreted to mean the abolition of police departments. Biden stated in a June 2020 opinion piece, ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police."" President Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that Biden supports ""defunding police""; the Trump campaign spent at least $20 million in July 2020 on campaign ads promoting the falsehood.[52][53] As a senator, Biden had long forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure which was supported by police unions but opposed by police chiefs.[54][55] As a 2020 presidential candidate, Biden faced criticism from some on the left for his proposal to double federal spending for community policing programs, to $300 million.[56] He called for racial justice while speaking at George Floyd's funeral service.[57] In September 2020, he condemned the institutional racism in the United States and police violence against African American communities.[58]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden earned a reputation for being a ""drug warrior"", leading efforts in the war on drugs.[59] During the 1980s crack epidemic when both Democrats and Republicans were ""tough on crime"", Biden was the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee that passed numerous punitive measures against drug offenders. In 1986, Biden sponsored and co-wrote the Anti-Drug Abuse Act which caused a large disparity between the sentencing of crack cocaine and powder cocaine users. Black drug users were more likely than whites to use crack and hence were incarcerated in larger numbers.[60][61] He later acknowledged the negative consequences of the legislation and in 2010 supported the Fair Sentencing Act.[62] The bill eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine, and aimed to reduce the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses.[63]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden favored increased funding for anti-drug efforts. He frequently criticized President Ronald Reagan in this regard,[64] stating in 1982 that the administration's ""commitment is minuscule in terms of dollars"".[65] He also criticized President George H. W. Bush's anti-drug strategy as ""not tough enough, bold enough or imaginative enough"",[66] stating that ""what we need is another D-Day, not another Vietnam, not a limited war, fought on the cheap"".[64] In 1982, Biden advocated for the creation of a drug czar, a government official overseeing all anti-drug operations. This led to the establishment of the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.[59] Biden also supported increased penalties against those caught selling drugs within 1,000 feet of schools.[67]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden advocated for increased use of civil asset forfeiture by law enforcement agencies.[66] Biden played a key part in the passage of the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act in 1983, partnering with Strom Thurmond, a conservative Republican. A Washington Post article described Biden's role in the negotiations: ""He got the Democrats to agree to strengthen forfeiture laws and allow judges to hold more defendants without bail; he persuaded the Republicans to drop such controversial provisions as a federal death penalty, and he made sure Thurmond got most of the credit. Civil liberties groups said the measure could have been far worse without Biden.""[68]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"In the early 2000s, Biden was critical of raves, describing most of them as ""havens"" for use of ecstasy and other illegal drugs.[69] He was the sponsor of the bipartisan Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act in 2002; the bill's successor, the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, was later enacted as part of a broader 2003 crime bill that became law.[69][70] The legislation, an expansion of the existing 1986 federal anti-""crack house"" statute, provided for civil and criminal penalties for event promoters and property owners/managers who knowingly allowed their property to be used for sale or consumption of drugs.[71] The legislation was opposed by the ACLU and electronic dance music enthusiasts who viewed it as overly broad.[70][72] Responding to criticism, Biden said that the statute would not target law-abiding promoters, saying on the Senate floor: ""The reason I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill 'the rave scene' or silence electronic music—all things of which I have been accused. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or expression. It is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids.""[70] Although the law has been rarely used, advocates such as Drug Policy Alliance and DanceSafe argue that it discourages event producers from engaging in harm reduction efforts, and have sought to clarify the law.[73]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden opposed the legalization of marijuana as a young senator in 1974, in contrast to his other more liberal views.[74] In 2010 he maintained this position, stating: ""I still believe it's a gateway drug. I've spent a lot of my life as chairman of the Judiciary Committee dealing with this. I think it would be a mistake to legalize.""[66] In a 2014 interview, Biden said, ""I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources"" but said, ""Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization.""[75] In 2019 and 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden expressed support for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing medical marijuana; reclassifying it as a Schedule II drug to ease marijuana research; automatically expunging prior convictions for marijuana convictions; and allowing states to legalize without federal interference.[76][77] In October 2022, President Biden announced that all federal convictions for simple marijuana possession would be pardoned, while also announcing that he would initiate a review to determine how cannabis should be scheduled under federal law, adding that the Schedule I classification of cannabis ""makes no sense"".[78][79]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

He later claimed publicly on several occasions that the USA PATRIOT Act, which eased restrictions on the Executive branch in the surveillance and detention of those suspected of terrorism or facilitating it, was essentially a duplicate of the anti-terrorist legislation he had drafted years earlier.[99] Biden supported the PATRIOT Act but voted to limit wiretapping on the bill. He supports implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to fight terrorists but voted to preserve habeas corpus rights to the alleged terror suspects serving in Guantanamo Bay. In the 1990s, he voted in favor of 36 vetoed military projects and supports efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. He was given a 60% approval rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reflecting a mixed voting record on civil rights issues.

Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical.""[104] Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized and partially funded the construction of fencing along the Mexican border,[105] mostly as a means to combat cross-border drug trafficking.[104] During the same campaign, Biden said that would not allow sanctuary cities to ignore federal law.[106] In 2007, Biden said that illegal immigration would not stop unless U.S. employers stopped hiring undocumented workers, saying: ""All the rest is window dressing.""[107]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

Russia has repeatedly shown that it is not ready to abide by the rules of international trade.""[157] Biden described the Russian action as ""part of a bigger picture in which Russia has failed to behave as a responsible member in the international community"" and called for the U.S. to block Russia's application to join the World Trade Organization.[157] Biden also worked to promote funding to research avian influenza.[156]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has outlined a rural and agricultural policy broadly similar to that of the Obama administration. The plan aims to obtain net zero emissions for agriculture (making the U.S. the first nation to do so) via incentives and permitting farmers to join carbon markets. The plan also calls for changes in trade policy to encourage U.S. agriculture exports; expansion of broadband Internet in rural areas; renewable energy investment; promotion of local and regional food; and an expansion of the USDA Conservation Stewardship Program to encourage farmers to adopt carbon sequestration and other environmental practices.[158]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies and Biden's largest contributor in the late 1990s,[51] and other credit card issuers.[159] He fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines.[159] He also worked to defeat amendments which would have protected members of the military and those who are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debt. Critics expressed concern that the law would force those seeking bankruptcy protection to hire lawyers to process the required paperwork, making it more difficult for students to execute education-related debt.[51] The overall bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton in 2000, but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting it.[159] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden moved to the left on the issue, endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy reform proposal, which would roll back many aspects of the 2005 law.[160][161][162]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

The legislation would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions and required a reduction in U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.[167] He strongly opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling,[168][169] although when he became president, he only called for a temporary moratorium instead.[170] In 2007–2008, during his presidential campaign, Biden called for a gradual increase in automobile fuel-economy standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2017,[167] called for increase production of renewable energy,[167] and identified energy security and resolving the energy crisis as key priorities.[171]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

The proposal incorporated elements of the Green New Deal proposal but lacked many key aspects, such as less funding, no healthcare expansion, no guaranteed jobs or benefits, less guaranteed housing, and no bans on fracking.[172] Biden's plan would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; halt issuance of new permits for oil and gas extraction on public land and water; step up Clean Air Act enforcement; strengthen fuel economy standards to promote a shift to electric vehicles; regulate methane pollution; and create ""aggressive"" energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.[173] Biden also promised that he would re-enter the Paris Agreement (from which Trump pulled the U.S.) on his first day in the White House and called for ""a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries' climate targets.""[173] To pressure countries failing to meet their climate obligations, Biden also called for ""carbon adjustment fees"" to be levied on goods imported from countries that failed to meet emissions targets.[173] The plan also won considerable support from the fossil fuel industry.[174]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

The areas can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. In January 2021, the administration put a pause on new federal gas and oil leasing but was sued to open them for sale by several Republican-led states.

Because while Iraq's illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not – do not – pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered.

There's other organizations as strong and as consequential"" and adding ""I've never disagreed with AIPAC on the objective. Whenever I've had disagreement with AIPAC it has always been a tactical disagreement, not a substantive disagreement.""[262] Biden strongly opposed granting executive clemency to Jonathan Pollard, who was convicted of spying for Israel, saying ""If it were up to me, he would stay in jail for life.""[248][263]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

But the notion that somehow if Israel just did the right thing, [the peace process] would work ... give me a break."" He also stated that ""The responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist, will not play fair, will not deal, will not renounce terror.""[255] During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated that the Bush administration's policy concerning the Middle East had been ""an abject failure"" and pledged that, if elected, he and Barack Obama would ""change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.""[259] In a 2010 speech to the Jewish Federations of North America, Biden said ""There is no substitute for direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured – the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli people's decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for nationhood.""[268] Speaking in 2019, Biden said, ""At the present, neither the Israeli nor Palestinian leadership seems willing to take the political risks necessary to make progress through direct negotiations,"" and said that if elected president, he would be focusing on urging ""both sides to take steps to keep the prospect of a two-state outcome alive.""[251] Following Trump's controversial move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Biden said he would not return the embassy to Tel Aviv if elected president, but that he would re-open the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem for outreach to Palestinians.[251]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

"Biden has consistently criticized Israeli settlement policy.[251] In a 2009 speech at the AIPAC conference, Biden called upon Israel ""to work towards a two-state solution"" by dismantling existing Israeli settlements, halting new settlement construction, and allowing Palestinians freedom of movement, and called on the Palestinians to ""combat terror and incitement against Israel.""[270] In a 2016 speech to J Street, Biden said that he had ""overwhelming frustration"" with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the government's promotion and expansion of settlements, legalization of outposts, and land seizures. Noting that he had opposed Israeli settlements for more than three decades, Biden said they are counterproductive to Israel's security. In the same speech, Biden criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks and Palestinian recourse to the International Criminal Court, which he called ""damaging moves that only take us further from the path toward peace,"" and called out President Mahmoud Abbas for failing to condemn terrorist attacks. Regarding a multi-billion dollar defense deal that the U.S. was negotiating with Israel, Biden said ""Israel will not get everything it asks for, but it will get every single solitary thing it needs,"" and said: ""No matter what political disagreements we have with Israel – and we do have political disagreements now – there is never any question about our commitment to Israel's security.""[271][272] In a subsequent speech in December 2019, Biden criticized Netanyahu for his drift to ""the extreme right in his party,"" calling this move a bid to retain political power and a ""serious mistake.""[273]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

He believes Iran, not Russia, will be the biggest beneficiaries in the short term if Syria remains a battlefield. President Bashar al-Assad will also need to be removed from power, otherwise Syria will never have peace or security.[279] Biden said there is no uniting principle in Syria, unlike Iraq, hence only certain safe harbors can be established in the region to reduce the number of displaced people and deaths.[279]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

These initiatives were part of a larger effort for institutional reform in the region to counter drug trafficking.[350][351]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"During the 2014 Central American child-migrant crisis, Biden supported a $1 billion economic aid package to affected Central American countries. In an op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote, ""the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.""[352] He also supported further institutional reforms to combat corruption in those countries, so they can provide their people with safer living conditions.[353]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"While in the Senate, Biden voted for the Helms-Burton Act and supported the U.S. embargo against Cuba; in 2006, Biden called for the U.S. to be ""putting together a plan as to how we are going to play a positive role in moving that country, after the Castros are gone ... more toward democratization and liberalization.""[226][354] As vice president, Biden supported Obama's Cuban thaw and reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.[355] Biden stated that the lifting of U.S. trade and travel restrictions removed an ""ineffective stumbling block to our bilateral relations with other nations in the hemisphere"" and made it easier for the U.S. to engage on issues around human rights.[355]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Biden has criticized Trump's moves to roll back the détente between the U.S. and Cuba, writing in an op-ed in Americas Quarterly that Trump's resumptions of restrictions on travel and commerce harm Cubans seeking ""greater independence from the Communist state"" and alienate Western Hemisphere allies.[356] Biden also wrote in the Miami Herald that ""Trump's...callously limiting the ability of Cuban Americans to reunite with and support their families in Cuba, and the administration's Latin America policy, at best, is a Cold War-era retread and, at worst, at worst, an ineffective mess.""[357] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to restore Obama-era U.S. relations with Cuba.[224][358]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden
"Asked about the 2021 Cuban protests, Biden criticized the ""failed state"" of Cuba for repressing its citizens and referred to communism, which Cuba follows, as ""a universally failed system."" The President also described socialism as ""not a very good substitute.""[359][360][361]",,en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden

"One of the ironies of the liberals’ dream of the post-racial United States in the run-up to that election was that Muslims were never meant to be part of it. The lie that Obama is Muslim was always code for “He’s Black.” But in 2008 liberals couldn’t say that they wouldn’t vote for someone who is Black. Post-racial anti-Blackness had to be more subtle. After seven years of the War on Terror, it was widely accepted that Muslims are subhuman and our lives disposable. So it was easy for people to simply say that they wouldn’t vote for someone who is Muslim. ",,inthesetimes.com,https://inthesetimes.com/article/muslims-palestinians-vote-biden-2024-election-bhatti
"The HBO political satire Veep captures how insidious and widespread anti-Muslim rhetoric remains. Spoiler alert, but in the show’s penultimate episode, news broke that U.S. President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) had accidentally bombed a wedding in Pakistan and her popularity soared as a result. One of her advisers tells her, “It turns out Americans don’t give a flying fatwa if you drone a bunch of Muslims!” Another adds, “Your favorables have never been higher, ma’am.”",,inthesetimes.com,https://inthesetimes.com/article/muslims-palestinians-vote-biden-2024-election-bhatti
"During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama never directly addressed the bigotry behind the allegations that he is Muslim. Obama treated the misinformation campaign as a slanderous lie, further reinforcing the idea that Muslims are unfit for the Oval Office. At a rally in Michigan, members of his campaign even asked Muslim women in hijabs who were sitting behind the podium to move so cameras wouldn’t catch them in the frame. I, like many Muslims, found his campaign’s handling of the issue to be infuriating.",,inthesetimes.com,https://inthesetimes.com/article/muslims-palestinians-vote-biden-2024-election-bhatti
"And yet, when I was confronted with this woman’s allegation in North Carolina, my initial instinct was to let it go and simply reassure her that Obama is, in fact, a churchgoing Christian. After all, the margins in the polls in North Carolina were razor thin and after George W. Bush’s wars on Muslims, both domestically and internationally, we needed to get a Democrat in there, even if he was tacitly enabling anti-Muslim bigots. I bit my tongue and did my job.",,inthesetimes.com,https://inthesetimes.com/article/muslims-palestinians-vote-biden-2024-election-bhatti
"Obama went on to further Bush’s wars, bomb more Muslim-majority countries than Bush, and kill countless more Muslims. The horrifying “double-tap” policy for the U.S. drone program was also employed under his watch as he expanded airstrikes in Muslim-majority countries. That approach is when after a drone is ordered to fire, they wait a period of time and fire again — often after first responders have arrived — seeking to kill not just their first target, but also those in the target’s vicinity. I voted for Obama again in 2012. I even went to Nevada and knocked on doors for him, yet again.

Horserace polling can’t tell us anything new about who will win the electoral college – but the existence of an anti-Maga majority is clear,,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"N
ow that Thanksgiving has passed in America, and everyone’s Trumpy uncle is on his way back to his conservative state, we still have our catastrophizing Democratic cousins to contend with. Triggered by the drumbeat of horrific poll results, they are panicking that Joe Biden is too old and unpopular to prevent a second Trump administration from taking power.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"These cousins, and perhaps you too, are suffering from the latest strain of what I call Mad Poll Disease. It’s a perpetual state of anxiety – spread by the media’s obsession with using polls to forecast the outcome of the next election, instead of empowering voters with all the information they need to decide what they want that outcome to be and act, or vote, accordingly.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"To cure Mad Poll Disease, start by making this your mantra: Horserace polling can’t tell us anything we don’t already know before election day about who will win the electoral college. We know it will be close. We know it will be decided by six swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Importantly, these states were so close that even the best polls couldn’t call all of them the day before the 2016, 2020 or 2022 elections.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"In both 2016 and 2020, the margin of victory in most of them was less than one point. If you had clicked on FiveThirtyEight in June 2022, you would have thought Republicans had a 60% chance of controlling the Senate, in September that Democrats had a 70% chance of holding the Senate, and on election day, that Republican had a 60% chance of flipping it again. But in the real world, Democrats increased their Senate majority.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"Trying to use horserace polls to project the winner in swing states is like trying to predict the weather nine months from now by taking the temperature outside today. Elections come down to turnout, and what that will look like on election day is truly anyone’s guess. Taking the temperature of how voters feel today doesn’t tell us how they’ll feel a year from now – much less whether they will act on those feelings by turning out to vote, or for whom they’ll vote if they do.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats

"Pollsters want voters to tell them who they will vote for next November; voters want to tell pollsters how unsatisfied they are now with the direction of the country and their own lives. For most of this century, Americans have said the country was on the wrong track – and they have taken out those broader frustrations on whoever was president at the time. Low presidential approval ratings are now the norm in the United States (for old and young presidents alike), in a stark contrast to the last century.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats

"But when it comes time to cast a ballot, voters understand the stakes. This is where we can really tell those cousins to take heart: ever since Trump’s shocking win in 2016, many Americans who thought elections didn’t matter realized that they very much do. Most Americans reject everything Trump and Maga stand for – taking away our freedoms, filling the government with incompetent lackeys, and ruling with hate and fear. An anti-Maga majority was born, and it has turned out to vote in record numbers again and again. This has been a predictable weather pattern since 2018, but most pollsters and pundits fail to account for it.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"Remember how 2022 was supposed to be a Red Wave, but it never materialized? Actually, it did – in 35 states. But in the other 15 states, where a prominent Maga candidate was running, we saw numbers more like the 2018 Blue Wave. Where voters understood the anti-Maga stakes, they turned out. This allowed Democrats to keep the Senate. When Democrats lost the House, it was by a much narrower margin than pundits expected. And it could have gone the other way had anti-Maga voters in California, New Jersey and New York understood what similar voters in the states with key Senate races understood – that staying home was voting for Maga to control the chamber.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"As a practical matter, only Biden can decide not to run, and he shouldn’t base that decision on fear of bad polls. Polls can mislead us into making unforced errors. We hear a lot about how risky it is to run an 81-year-old candidate with bad poll numbers. What about how risky it would be to replace someone who has beaten Trump before, and who has already been defined by both left and right, with someone who hasn’t? It would be an absurd gamble – like doubling down on your bet when you haven’t seen any of your own cards yet.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"It’s even more absurd to focus on this when we still have a year of news headlines in front of us. As we saw after Roe v Wade was overturned, there is a huge difference between knowing intellectually that something could happen, and actually living in the world where it is happening. It’s not news to most people that Trump will stand trial for multiple criminal indictments next year. But none of us can fully feel the way we will about it once we are reminded every day of Trump’s crimes against the country.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"To be clear, I’m not saying that Biden is going to win – just that there’s no reason to declare him likely to lose. But media outlets create this narrative out of thin air when they choose to field and devote so many headlines to horserace polls a year out from the election. This saps our agency as voters by creating a false sense of inevitability about the final outcome. And it steals oxygen from coverage of why an election matters – the real stakes to voters’ lives.",,www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats
"We know what those stakes are because we have lived through some of them. We know how much worse Trump and Maga are promising to do.

"The Democratic Party has just nominated Joe Biden and his running mate at its mid-July convention in Milwaukee, while Republicans are gearing up to renominate Donald Trump in Charlotte, N.C. At his usual rallies, Trump is pointing to the roaring economy to make his case for re-election, while Biden struggles to stir up crowds with his plea for a return to normalcy.

"But in the 2020 that’s actually happening, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything–from how the campaign is conducted to how we vote to what we value. It has canceled conventions, relegated fundraising and campaigning to the digital realm, and forced many states to rapidly change how people get and submit their ballots, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous results. The acute crises have refocused the nation’s attention, bringing issues like public health and economic and racial inequality to the fore and prompting the public to revisit what characteristics it wants in its leaders.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"For four years, Trump has been the dominant force and inescapable fact not only of national politics but also of American life. Now he finds himself displaced as the central character in his own campaign by a plague that answers to no calendar, ideology or political objective. Just as the virus has changed the way adults report to offices and children go to school, upending whole industries in the process, it has spurred a massive shift in the fundamental act of American democracy: how we select the President who will be charged with ending the pandemic’s reign of destruction, dealing with its aftermath and shaping the nation that rises from its ashes. And as with so many other changes wrought by the coronavirus, the practice of American politics may never be quite the same again.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"This was always going to be an unusual contest–the high-stakes re-election campaign of a historically divisive President at a pivotal moment for the nation, a referendum on his norm-shattering style and disruptive vision, a test for his scattered opposition to prove which side of a polarized political spectrum represents the mainstream. As the campaign enters its final three-month stretch, Trump trails badly in national and battleground-state polls as Americans give his dismal handling of the pandemic a failing grade. But the end of Trump’s turbulent term will be written by the virus. It startled us with its rise and spread in January and February, suspended normal life in March and April, and lulled many into complacency before whipsawing us again with its resurgence in June and July. Who knows what kind of October surprise it may have in store?",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Like most things these days, presidential politics has adapted in ways that can get a little weird. For example, on Facebook one recent Thursday evening, Donald Trump Jr. is rhapsodizing with the aging former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka about childhood physical abuse. “Maybe a few more kids in this country need a little bit more ass whoopin’ than participation medals!” says Trump Jr., who wears an open-necked purple polo shirt and AirPods. Ditka, whose phone is tilted upward toward his bottle-brush mustache, looks confused. “How can you say that?” he replies. “These poor kids.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The broadcast, an installment of Trump Jr.’s Triggered podcast, epitomizes the content the Trump campaign is feeding hungry supporters online. On another recent evening, it hosted “The Right View,” in which Trump Jr.’s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump’s wife Lara, and Trump campaign aides Mercedes Schlapp and Katrina Pierson laud the debunked virtues of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment in a segment that will eventually rack up more than half a million views on Facebook.

"The Biden campaign has also moved online, where its presence, like its candidate, is more sedate and traditional. “Events” are advertised to local supporters and organized around constituency groups or issues, just as they would be in a normal campaign. Biden’s wife Jill appears, via Zoom, at a “virtual campaign stop” with the mayor of West Palm Beach, Fla., to talk about his plans for seniors; former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams hosts an online “racial and economic justice roundtable” with business owners in Detroit; Biden himself joins his former running mate, Barack Obama, for a stagey 15-minute “conversation” about the Trump Administration’s failures.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Despite the pandemic, Trump had hoped to keep up the rallies central to his political mythology. But an attempted return to the stage in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20 turned into a debacle, with a sparse, mostly maskless crowd that barely filled the bottom deck of the indoor arena. Lately he’s settled for online “tele-rallies,” glorified conference calls that Trump supporters in key states are invited to tune in to a couple of times a week. At a recent one targeting voters in Maine and New Hampshire, Trump dutifully shouts out the local Republican candidates, extols lobster fishermen and vows to get tough on Canadian currency manipulation. Almost 13,000 people are listening live, and hundreds of thousands more will eventually “view” the half-hour audio stream. “The future of our nation will be defined by patriots who love our country and want to build it up and make it bigger and better and stronger–or it will be defined by the radical left. And usually radical left Democrats are left-wing extremists who hate our country,” he intones.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"In person, this kind of line would draw a roar from Trump’s throngs of admirers, but online, the only feedback is the silent scroll of Facebook comments. Trump’s political adviser Jason Miller says the tele-rallies have been a hit. “The genius of Donald Trump is that he knows how to foster and build one-on-one relationships with his voters,” he says. But it’s clear the virtual gatherings are no substitute for the real thing. Lacking his usual source of mass adulation, the President has taken to touting the crowds that line the streets when he visits various states on official business.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Some local candidates–mainly Republicans–are still holding in-person events despite the risks. But the pandemic has become a vector for partisan attacks. When a GOP Senate candidate in Virginia posted a video of himself attending an indoor political event without a mask, the state Democratic Party seized on the image to call him “dangerously irresponsible.” Many state Democratic parties have chosen to hold all-virtual conventions, but several of their GOP counterparts have tried to blaze ahead. The Republican Party of Texas took its case all the way to the state Supreme Court, which sided with the Houston mayor who had canceled its in-person convention. The hastily assembled virtual confab that ensued featured extensive technical difficulties–at one point, Texas Monthly reported, pranksters invaded an online planning document and added “Peepeepoopoo” to the schedule–and by the end angry delegates ousted the state chairman.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"It’s been a similar story at the national level. Democrats decided early on that the planned July convention in Milwaukee would not be feasible; it was pushed back to mid-August and radically scaled down, with delegates staying home and voting remotely and Biden himself staying away. The GOP has had a bumpier road. In June, Trump moved the convention from Charlotte, N.C., to Jacksonville, Fla., in a fit of pique over the North Carolina Democratic governor’s insistence on safety protocols. As Florida’s COVID-19 caseload surged this summer, party officials made a series of frantic adjustments, culminating in a last-ditch effort to hold the festivities in an outdoor stadium in the August heat. Finally, in late July, Trump announced the Jacksonville program would be scotched; the current plan, which is still being developed, is to hold a small number of party meetings in North Carolina and have the President accept the nomination with a televised speech at a location to be determined.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The lack of traditional conventions is perhaps not such a loss. Events where party insiders in smoke-filled rooms once actually picked presidential nominees and running mates have become, in the modern era, little more than infomercials. But they serve as a major engine of the parties’ fundraising–another operation that’s moved online in the age of coronavirus.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The swanky catered affairs that donors once paid tens of thousands of dollars per plate to attend are now BYOB livestreams. Campaigns have had to get creative as the novelty fades. “When the stay-at-home orders started, campaigns immediately started doing virtual events–a Zoom fundraiser, a field-organizer hangout,” says Brian Krebs, who works at a Democratic digital-campaign firm called Rising Tide Interactive. “But the bar is rising now that a lot of people are Zoomed out. You’ve got to have a special guest or some kind of hook. People aren’t going to show up if it’s just 12 squares talking.” On the other hand, celebrity guests can be easier to land when they can appear at your fundraiser without leaving L.A. The Texas Democratic Senate nominee MJ Hegar recently recorded an event with the cast of Supernatural and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, none of whom were physically present. Hegar campaign volunteers have also gotten creative with their outreach, holding a voter-registration texting session that doubled as a Taylor Swift listening party.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Around this time in an election, campaigns traditionally shift from registering, identifying and persuading voters to pushing them to the polls. The GOP is still doing so, knocking on a million doors a week, the Republican National Committee claims. But on the left, an intense debate has broken out about the ethics of going door-to-door amid a plague. Research suggests that in-person conversations with voters are the most effective way to get them to turn out. But most liberal groups and the Biden campaign aren’t planning on door knocking this year, viewing it as too risky for workers and voters alike. One group that forged ahead, the Progressive Turnout Project, had to suspend its operations in a dozen states after several employees tested positive for COVID-19.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The irony is more Americans are eager for political engagement this year. In a Fox News poll in July, 85% said they were extremely or very motivated to vote, and the percentage of respondents who told Gallup they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting was up 10 points from 2016. Despite the difficulties of pandemic voting, primaries in states such as Texas and Georgia have set turnout records. At the same time, new voter registrations have plummeted because of the closure of government offices like departments of motor vehicles.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"In Pinal County, Arizona, a small progressive organization called Rural Arizona Engagement had gotten only a quarter of the way to its voter-registration goal when it had to stop canvassing in March. Attempts to continue the work by phone were mostly unsuccessful. Even though Arizona is currently a coronavirus hot spot, the group hopes to go back into the field to turn out the vote. “We feel like if we can follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and train our staff in a way that protects them and the people we’re talking to, this is a year that requires this work to be done,” says the group’s co–executive director Natali Fierros Bock.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The pandemic, she says, has heightened people’s awareness of why their vote matters. (It’s also increased canvassers’ success rate: with so many people isolated in their homes, more are willing to answer the door and talk with a stranger.) Despite robust public support for wearing masks, the Pinal County board of supervisors decided against a mask mandate for businesses, and the rabble-rousing county sheriff, Mark Lamb, announced he would not enforce the state’s stay-at-home order. (Lamb was forced to cancel a planned appearance with Trump at the White House when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in June.) “People are starting to connect the dots,” Fierros Bock says, “and consider who is serving in these local offices and how much power they wield.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The pandemic landed in the midst of America’s primary-election season, forcing state election officials to adapt on the fly. The results offer a glimpse of the massive challenges the general election will pose–and the disasters that could ensue.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"One of the first test runs came in Ohio, whose primary was scheduled for March 17, just days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, the NBA abruptly suspended its season and states across the country began rapidly shutting down. When Republican Governor Mike DeWine sought to delay the primary, some candidates sued, and courts ruled he didn’t have the power to do so. Finally, at 4 a.m. on Election Day, with workers already starting to set up for balloting, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the state’s health director could order the polls closed as an emergency measure. But the GOP-controlled legislature wouldn’t go along with DeWine’s proposal to move the vote to June, so a mail-only election with an April 28 deadline was held instead.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Other states soon had their own experiences with the logistical, constitutional and political complexities of pandemic voting. In Wisconsin’s April 7 primary–held on schedule after a last-minute standoff between its Democratic governor and Republican legislature–hundreds of polling locations were forced to close when poll workers fearful for their safety declined to show up. Hundreds of thousands of voters still turned out, standing in socially distanced lines for hours to cast their ballots. (One scientific study later tied the election to a surge in COVID-19 cases, though other researchers disagreed with that assessment.) Georgia’s June 9 primary melted down amid short staffing and technical problems, leading to endless lines and significant disenfranchisement that Democrats charged was an intentional bid by GOP officials to suppress the vote. In New York, a state that normally votes almost entirely in person, election officials blame an unprecedented flood of absentee ballots for the fact that more than a month after the June 23 election, they still haven’t declared a winner in some contests.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"In each case, the coronavirus struck at a system that was already fragile. “It is a mistake to think of the pandemic as something separate from other problems with our election systems,” says Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine. “It interacts with the existing pathologies to make things worse.” Hasen’s most recent book, Election Meltdown, was published on Feb. 4, the day after the calamitous Iowa Democratic caucuses, whose delayed results illustrated the problems balky election infrastructure can produce even without a worldwide epidemic.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Many states that have been administering elections in person for decades are now attempting to pivot to mail voting, allowing people to vote absentee without an excuse or by citing COVID-19 as a legitimate medical reason. But not all. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Democratic lawsuit that sought to allow all Texas voters to choose mail ballots. In Georgia, the GOP secretary of state mailed every voter a ballot application for the primary but will not do so for the general election. “I think it’s because there was historic turnout, particularly among Democratic primary voters, and [Republicans] don’t want to encourage that in the general election,” says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Some states, including California, Nevada and Vermont, will mail ballots to all voters, joining five existing states with universal mail voting. Many others will send all voters an absentee-ballot application, but experts warn they may not be prepared for the flood that is coming. Postage, postmark and notarization or witness requirements vary widely from state to state. States facing pandemic-induced budget crunches aren’t necessarily in a position to pay for protective equipment and millions of stamps, but Congress has allocated only a fraction of the election funding they’ve requested. The U.S. Postal Service, itself teetering on the brink of insolvency, is ill equipped to handle the surge, and Democrats allege the popular agency, recently entrusted to a Trump ally, may be intentionally slowing the mail in urban areas in order to help the President. States’ voting procedures continue to shift as the vote nears, making it difficult for voters to keep track of what’s required.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"What worries election experts the most is that all these challenges and changes could throw the result into doubt. Barring a blowout, election night is likely to end without a clear winner, and it could take weeks or months to count all the votes. “What we didn’t see in the primary, even where there was confusion or it took weeks to count, was someone calling the election rigged or stolen,” says Aditi Juneja, an attorney who staffs the bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises. “We want to make sure that happens in the general election. If the outcome is unclear or uncertain, that leaves space for bad actors to make wild claims.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"That, of course, is exactly what Trump has been doing. Continuing the drumbeat he began in 2016, the President has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the vote, wrongly insisting that mail voting is not secure and that the election will be “rigged.” Trump claims there is a difference between vote by mail, which generally refers to ballots mailed to all voters, and absentee voting, when voters typically must request a ballot. But experts say there’s no difference in terms of security. Trump attacked Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, for going “rogue” when she mailed absentee-ballot applications before the state’s primary–a step many of her GOP counterparts had also taken. “It is not helpful when false or misleading information, mudslinging and partisan rhetoric are injected into the discourse,” Benson tells TIME. “It causes people to have doubts about the sanctity of the process and the validity of their vote. The truth is, we are working every day to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"On July 30, Trump suggested postponing the presidential election, prompting an immediate outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike. “The concerns the President has raised are not valid in the state of Ohio,” Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose, a Republican, tells TIME. “Both political parties in Ohio have trusted our system for 20 years and work hard to get voters to take advantage of voting by mail.” As for postponing the election, “That is not something we should even be considering,” he says.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Election experts of both parties worry that Trump’s pernicious campaign to undermine confidence in the election’s integrity is a pretext for refusing to accept the result if he loses, throwing the nation into constitutional crisis or worse. When a bipartisan group of academics and former officials called the Transition Integrity Project recently war-gamed a contested election, every iteration of the exercise produced “both street-level violence and political impasse,” the group’s organizer, Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks, told the Boston Globe.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"When the reality of the pandemic began to set in, Trump’s approval rating initially went up, as often happens for Presidents in times of crisis. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump–which has stayed within a narrow band throughout his term–reached 46% in late March, the highest level since his Inauguration, according to the polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight. Then it began to plummet.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Today, barely 40% approve of Trump’s performance, while nearly 55% disapprove. Americans now disapprove of his handling of the pandemic by a 20-point margin. Biden holds significant leads in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan. States such as Texas, Arizona and Georgia, which Democrats haven’t won at the presidential level in decades, may now be up for grabs. Many top Republicans fret that their candidates are in for a wipeout up and down the ballot. “The breadth and depth of Trump’s weakness is hard to overstate,” says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, a member of the Navigator Research team that has surveyed more than 24,000 Americans on a rolling basis since March. “There was a little bit of rally-round-the-flag at the beginning–people wanted him to succeed–and then when it was clear that he wasn’t taking it seriously, you saw that change.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"In truth, Trump was an unusually weak incumbent long before the pandemic hit, the only President never to top 50% approval in Gallup’s regular tracking. His current rating remains higher than his nadir of 35% in August 2017, after the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Democrats’ current 8-point advantage on the generic ballot is about the same as their margin in the national vote in 2018. Biden has consistently held an edge over Trump, posting margins similar to or greater than the current state polls since before he even entered the race. A large portion of the American electorate seems to have made up its mind about this President early on, abandoning him–and his party–and never looking back.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Indicators that normally correlate to incumbents’ political fortunes, such as the economy, may not apply this year, says GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. The situation is simply too anomalous. Many people see the pandemic as a fluke wrought by China, and may be receptive to the argument that the economic pain is not the President’s fault. Trump may also be benefiting from the popular emergency economic relief legislation Democrats helped him enact. “The country can unite behind its leaders in a crisis if they feel like things are at least moving in the right direction,” Ruffini says. “The summer’s case spike seemed to break off that possibility for the President. He’ll still have a chance to show that things have turned a corner before November, but time is running very short.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"COVID-19 has changed the tenor of the election in unmistakable ways. Optimism has nosedived: the share of people who believe the U.S. is on the right track has declined 20 points since March. The pandemic has brought new urgency to issues like access to health care, inequality and the social safety net, while driving Trump’s preferred topics of immigration and trade out of the picture. “The voters are fundamentally the same, but the context of the 2020 election has changed,” says UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, author of Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Trump’s character flaws suddenly loom larger for voters. “For a long time, it was annoying but it didn’t necessarily change anything in their lives–‘I wish he’d stop tweeting, but the economy’s good,'” says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, which commissioned polls and focus groups of thousands of voters in suburban swing districts. “What this has done is to put the perception they already had about Trump together with real, horrific impacts on them and their family and their country.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Asked an open-ended question about Trump’s vision for the country, about half the respondents in Third Way’s surveys volunteered “self-serving” or “divisive.” Respondents also rejected his calls for “law and order” in response to street protests. Asked who is hurt by Trump’s vision, 30% of undecided suburban voters said “all of us.” “It used to be people would say LGBT people, or women, or people of color,” Erickson says. “Now, 4% say immigrants, 6% say minorities–but 30% say all of us.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Some focus-group participants were asked what they were looking for in the election. The responses were heavy on leadership qualities: people yearned for someone who was strong, compassionate and listened to experts. People agreed that Trump was strong (and questioned Biden’s strength) but rated the President abysmally on the other two.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Just as Trump’s worst qualities were magnified, Biden’s strengths suddenly seem matched to the moment. When he announced his candidacy a year ago, he said he was compelled to run by Trump’s equivocal response to Charlottesville. Some Democrats criticized his mantra of a “battle for the soul of the nation” as too puffy or vague at a time when his rivals were pumping out ambitious left-wing policy proposals. But a character-based campaign, tinged with nostalgia, now looks not just prescient but essential, whether or not you believe Biden has what it takes to deliver on it.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"Trump’s campaign insists he is positioned for victory despite the headwinds. Public polls are undercounting Republicans, says Miller, the Trump political adviser, and the President’s supporters are more enthusiastic about voting by a 2-to-1 ratio. “Are people going to stand in line for two hours to vote for someone they’re not enthusiastic about?” he asks. But analysts in both parties are skeptical. “Overwhelmingly, voters believe the pandemic and the resulting economic meltdown are the most important issues facing the country,” says GOP pollster Whit Ayres. “Efforts to change the subject might work with people who are already in favor of the President, but there’s no evidence they’re working with the people who need to be brought into his coalition if he’s going to win.”",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"If the pandemic has revealed the fault lines in American society, it has exposed something else too: some things are still too important to get caught up in politics. Trump’s attempts to make public health a partisan matter have mostly failed. Large majorities of Americans support their states’ pandemic restrictions, believe it’s more important to rein in the virus than to get the economy up and running, think more needs to be done and–by resounding margins–support mask wearing.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"The national mood has undergone a wholesale shift in this most tumultuous of election years. In Third Way’s studies, voters talked about feelings of sadness, anger, anxiety and fear. Pollsters’ response rates have skyrocketed because so many lonely, homebound people are answering the phone just to have someone to talk to. America is a divided nation, but also one that craves communion and solidarity. When a Black man was brutally murdered on video by police in Minneapolis, people took to the streets in unprecedented numbers. Three-quarters of Americans said they backed the recent racial-justice protests, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged, stunning political observers. It’s hard to imagine this happening without Trump. But it’s hard to imagine it without COVID-19 too.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/
"When one day Americans look back on this plague, the campaign it coincided with will be an inextricable part of the story. The U.S. has held elections under difficult circumstances before: wars, depressions, natural disasters. Each time, in the face of difficulty, we voted on schedule; each time, democracy gave us the opportunity to choose how we would steer out of the crisis.",,time.com,https://time.com/5876599/election-2020-coronavirus/

"To distract myself from wondering if my chest is tightening, I sometimes think about other things that could go really wrong this year. The list is long, but somewhere near the very top is the thought that the President could somehow eke out a close election victory, despite—well, despite everything.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"There’s no guarantee it won’t happen. The Democrats didn’t find a perfect candidate, and there’s going to be an endless blizzard of Facebook lies, and team Trump is topnotch at voter suppression. But there are ways to lessen the odds a little, and a good one would be to not have a third-party challenge from the left this year, at least in the six or seven battleground states that are going to make the difference. That means asking the Green Party to stand down in those places. People with impressive left credentials—Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, Ron Daniels—did this already, in January, in a well-argued open letter. But it didn’t seem to work: the Party’s most likely Presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, declared that he would run even if the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, who, Hawkins told an interviewer, had been “a little slow” in his plans for reform. Hawkins has run many times for governor of New York, and also for the House and the Senate from that state, while never getting more than five per cent of the vote. (He did come in a respectable second in a Fourth District city-council race in his home town of Syracuse, in 2013.) “Recognizing the danger of Trump does not mean that electing any damned Democrat should trump all other considerations,” Hawkins said. So I probably won’t be able to persuade him, either, but let me at least offer the suggestion that there’s a particularly useful reform that Greens—and others interested in a more vibrant politics—could be working on, instead, this autumn.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"To understand why this reform—ranked-choice voting—seems so important to me, let me say that, by ideology, I’m pretty much a Green. One of my favorite politicians anywhere is Bob Brown, a former member of the Australian Senate, who, in 1972, helped found what was arguably the first Green Party (and also saved a large portion of Tasmania’s classic wilderness). I’ve given speeches on behalf of German Greens and European Union Greens and local Green parties in many states and cities, and, whenever Canada holds an election, I stay up to watch the returns from the island district in the Pacific, off Vancouver, just to make sure that Elizabeth May, who for many years led the nation’s Green Party, has retained her seat. So I’m about as small-“g” green as green gets, having spent my adult life working on the greatest environmental crisis in the history of our civilization, the rapid heating of our planet.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"But I haven’t supported the Green Party in national elections in this country, and that’s because of the way our electoral laws work. The obvious difference between the United States on the one hand and most of Europe on the other is that we have a de-facto plurality-winner-take-all two-party system that makes it all but impossible for a small party to make a non-perverse difference, while European countries have parliamentary systems with electoral mechanisms that encourage small parties to play constructively pivotal roles. Time and again, by winning five or ten or twenty per cent of the vote, and a like share of seats, the Greens who operate in parliamentary democracies have ended up with enough representatives to give them bargaining power when it came time to form coalition governments. And those bargains make big differences: having the Greens in a power-sharing government was a major reason that Germany pioneered renewable energy; currently, in British Columbia, a Green-Liberal coalition has bolstered opposition to giant pipelines.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"In the United States, winning a few percentage points of the vote gets you nothing, except a chance to argue about whether you were the spoiler. Ralph Nader, in 2000, and Jill Stein, in 2016, have roundly insisted that they weren’t, arguing that the Democrats who were defeated in crucial states by margins smaller than their vote totals there did not run skillful enough campaigns. Relitigating that history seems less essential than looking ahead: the last poll I saw for Wisconsin showed that the race between a Democrat and Trump, for the state that many analysts predict will sway the election, was currently within three percentage points. So, if a Green Party candidate is on the ballot and attracts even a smidgen of support—well, it could end very badly indeed. And why would you take that chance this year?",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"That’s not to say that America wouldn’t be better off with more electoral alternatives. We clearly would. And to get them we needn’t wait for some unlikely constitutional change that might produce a parliamentary system. Instead, we can work to get more states to follow the lead of Maine, which last year introduced a ranked-choice voting system for most elections. Here’s how it works: if there are ten candidates on your ballot, you list your choices from one to ten. You can proudly vote for the Green candidate as your No. 1 choice for Congress, and, if she comes in last, you haven’t lost your vote or spoiled someone else’s chances.

"This is not some impossible dream of a reform—pundits used to say “as Maine goes so goes the nation,” and, indeed, last year, after Maine adopted the plan, so did New York City, with the support of seventy-three per cent of its voters. “Before the pandemic, R.C.V. was gaining momentum, with efforts teed up in several states to advance it via ballot initiative or legislative lobbying,” Josh Silver, the director of the electoral-reform campaign RepresentUs, said. “A ballot initiative for R.C.V. is likely in Alaska this year, and possibly in North Dakota and Massachusetts. There is a huge opportunity for legislative lobbying efforts in many other states, blue and red, as evidenced by the deep-red Utah legislature’s vote to allow their cities to enact R.C.V.” That is to say, Green enthusiasts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could skip Presidential campaigning and, instead, push their legislatures hard to put R.C.V. on the agenda. The pandemic has only increased the urgency, because the one drawback of a now necessary vote-by-mail system is that candidates sometimes drop out of elections after you’ve mailed in your ballot. Silver again: “This happened to millions of voters in this year’s primary, and R.C.V. fixes it. We must lean in hard to this opportunity.”",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"If we managed to enact this reform, the result would be a much better system in many ways. One is that you could really build small progressive parties without potential supporters worrying that they’d inadvertently elect Trumpish figures; if the Greens, or any third party, are ever going to have a real breakthrough on a national level, it will be because people can vote for them without fear, real or imagined, of being a spoiler. But there’s another reason, too, which I got to see close up while covering elections as a young city-hall reporter in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which for decades was the only major city in the country to use R.C.V. It’s that these elections not only allow for more ideological diversity but also tend to reduce the truly hateful divisiveness that’s become such a feature of our elections. If you’re a candidate in a ranked-choice election, you have a strong incentive not to be a sneering jerk to your competitors, because that kind of behavior reduces your chances of getting crucial No. 2 votes. You have to make your case, and you have to at least understand someone else’s.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"Obviously, campaigning for R.C.V. is less sexy than campaigning for President, and it will take a little while (though the whole Green Party project seems premised on a kind of radical patience). If the Party insists on running a Presidential candidate in the few states where it really matters, I hope people will not waste their votes on them. That’s not because I think Joe Biden is a hero; it’s because I think he’s not only better than the alternative but also pushable. Politics doesn’t end on Election Day—if you’re serious about change, politics in some ways begins once the votes are counted, with the less exciting business of prodding politicians to keep promises or opening up the political space for them to do what they want. In that world, which is always the real world, the job is to elect a politician whom you have a chance of pushing, one who might take advantage of openings that movements can provide.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"So, for instance, I had no problem working hard to elect Barack Obama as President (and Joe Biden as Vice-President), and also no problem helping gather some of the largest demonstrations of their Administration outside the White House. We were pushing for Obama to keep his pledge to be a climate activist by opposing the construction of the Keystone Pipeline; he eventually came on board. That was a hugely important development in the fight against climate change—and it launched similar movements around the world. With Trump’s election, of course, that kind of opening ceased—there’s no point pushing someone who takes pride in destruction. Now, there’s a very real chance that the pipeline will be built. Magnify that scenario across all the issues of the day and you see why most climate activists I know just shake their heads at the thought of a third-party challenge this November.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
"It took me a while to reach that point. In the first Presidential election I ever voted in, in 1980, I voted for Barry Commoner, of the Citizens Party (albeit in the safely blue state of Massachusetts). But the results of that and subsequent elections convinced me that Americans would do well to avoid third parties at the national level until our electoral structure shifts. That’s why, I think, Bernie Sanders has run for President as a Democrat and has always insisted that he would support the Party’s eventual nominee. As he told Biden on Monday afternoon, in his endorsement announcement, “I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every Independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy.” (He has also shown that you can change politics in dramatic ways from within the Democratic Party.) After Sanders lost in 2016 Democratic primary, I campaigned strenuously for Hillary Clinton across the swing states of the Midwest, and it was there that I began to worry that the Green Party was doing just well enough to threaten real trouble. So, that October, I wrote about the importance of voting for Clinton, even if she wasn’t your first choice. I don’t want to wait that long this time, and I know from reading the work of such long-standing Green activists as Ted Glick that there’s an active debate within the Green Party about the wisdom of competing in this year’s Presidential election.",,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy
I hope it’s never necessary to write any take on this subject again. And not because the Greens or other idea-oriented parties disappear but because we rebuild our electoral system in easily doable ways that would allow for better elections.,,www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/instead-of-challenging-joe-biden-maybe-the-green-party-could-help-change-our-democracy

"KEITH: Well, we've all seen polls showing Biden may have serious trouble with younger voters and voters of color. They are turned off from politics and, in some cases, disillusioned. So the Biden campaign is already spending money on advertising directed to Black and Latino voters in key swing states. And part of that is trying to figure out which messages will work and how to get them to people. Not a lot of them are likely to vote for Trump or a Republican, but they could stay home or vote for a third-party candidate.

"KEITH: Well, they had a ton of people out in the field, organizers in these key states. The Biden campaign just doesn't have that yet, and that makes some Democrats nervous. But the Biden team says they have to do things differently because the way people get information has changed so dramatically since then. And they have begun announcing some new hires in swing states - Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada. We'll be talking about them a lot in the year to come, and we can expect to see more of that.

"Organized by Arab American political activists, the group Listen to Michigan is asking voters who object to President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war — who view Biden as culpable in the deaths of nearly 30,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry — to choose “uncommitted” on the Feb. 27 Democratic presidential primary ballot.",,www.freep.com,https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2024/02/19/michigan-presidential-primary-2024-biden-uncommitted-votes-arab-american-support/72651890007/
"Among Arab American voters I’ve talked to, there’s pain and betrayal, white-hot rage, and a powerful aversion to casting a ballot for Biden, even if that hastens a second Donald Trump presidency, even though no one I talked to believes that would be better for Arab Americans, or for Gaza.",,www.freep.com,https://www.freep.com/story/opinion/columnists/nancy-kaffer/2024/02/19/michigan-presidential-primary-2024-biden-uncommitted-votes-arab-american-support/72651890007/

"As of last week, around 400 Arab American voters had requested absentee ballots — a gauge of voter enthusiasm and anticipated turnout — Grebner says.

"A campaign to get Michigan Democrats to vote against incumbent President Joe Biden in the state's February 27 primary has just gained a new supporter, Rep. Rashida Tlaib.

Congresswoman Tlaib, the daughter of Palestinian immigrants, has been an outspoken supporter of the Palestinian cause and was censured by the House last year for her pro-Palestinian comments, including her use of the controversial phrase ""from the river to the sea.""

Now, she's joining a campaign led by her sister to turn that disappointment in the Biden administration into an ""uncommitted"" vote in the upcoming Michigan primary, Tlaib said in a video posted to the X account of the campaign Listen To Michigan on February 17.

Tlaib described the campaign as a way to ""create a voting block"" that could voice its opposition to the current policy of military support for Israel, which Tlaib says is committing ""genocide.""",,www.businessinsider.in,https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/rashida-tlaib-endorses-campaign-to-vote-against-joe-biden-in-the-michigan-democratic-primary/articleshow/107837351.cms
"Tlaib's spokesperson hasn't returned a request for comment at the time of publication.

The campaign, Listen to Michigan, is an effort to earn Biden's backing for a cease-fire in Israel's war in Gaza by having Democrats vote ""uncommitted"" in the Michigan primary. It is largely led by activists from Dearborn, a Detroit-area city with a large Arab-American population that Tlaib represents in the House.

The group's campaign manager, Layla Elabed, is Tlaib's sister, but Tlaib didn't endorse the campaign immediately. Her office didn't respond to Business Insider's February 9 questions about the campaign, but she released the endorsement just over a week later.",,www.businessinsider.in,https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/rashida-tlaib-endorses-campaign-to-vote-against-joe-biden-in-the-michigan-democratic-primary/articleshow/107837351.cms
"The news comes after the Biden White House sent officials to speak with Michigan Arab-American and Muslim leaders earlier this month. There are concerns that dissatisfaction with Biden's foreign policy could hurt him in Michigan, which Biden won in 2020 by less than 3% and Hillary Clinton lost to Trump by less than 11,000 votes in 2016.

2020 Census data shows that more than 300,000 people of Middle Eastern and North African descent live in the state, which will likely be key to the president's reelection campaign. Muslim voters voted 64% to 35% for Biden in 2020, according to the AP.

Tlaib's endorsement of the strategy is the latest roadbump for the Biden campaign, though it is unlikely to threaten his hold on the primary for the state, where he is the only candidate other than Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips.

Biden's administration is supporting plans to send an additional $14 billion in aid to Israel on top of the billions of dollars the US spends every year. However, he recently described Israel's policy in Gaza as ""over the top.""

Tlaib's responded to the policy of her own party's leader by opposing efforts to give aid to Israel as a legislator and working with labor unions like the UAW who have endorsed a cease-fire. Now, speaking from an early voting site in Michigan, she's telling her constituents to vote against the president directly.

""If you want us to be louder then come here and vote uncommitted,"" Tlaib said.",,www.businessinsider.in,https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/world/news/rashida-tlaib-endorses-campaign-to-vote-against-joe-biden-in-the-michigan-democratic-primary/articleshow/107837351.cms

"Biden has rarely mentioned Musk or Tesla, the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, even when discussing issues involving the automobile industry or the administration’s efforts to promote EVs. Biden invited the chief executives of the Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. to the White House for an event in 2021 but did not extend an invitation to Tesla.

"That rankled Musk, who cited the administration’s snub on Wednesday. Without “doing anything to provoke the Biden administration, they held an electric vehicle summit at the White House and specifically refused to let Tesla attend,” Musk said. “Biden went on to add insult to injury and publicly said GM was leading the electric car revolution.”",,www.bnnbloomberg.ca,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/musk-says-he-cannot-see-himself-voting-for-biden-in-2024-1.2005198

"Since Biden has taken office, Musk has sought to court influence with Republicans and is a longtime donor to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He’s also offered praise for many of Biden’s political adversaries and encouraged the public to vote for a GOP Congress in the 2022 midterm elections.

And I’m here to tell you why.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"I’m running for president because we have a country to save. Since the start of my campaign, I’ve been focused on the real issues our country faces. The ones that determine whether America will thrive… or spiral out.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/

We’ve all heard the calls for me to drop out. We all know where they’re coming from. The political elite.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
The party bosses. Their cheerleaders in the commentator world.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
The argument is familiar. They say I haven’t won a state. That my path to victory is slim. They point to the primary polls and say I’m only delaying the inevitable. Why keep fighting when the battle was apparently over after Iowa?,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Look, I get it. In politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong. A lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. The pressure on them was too much. They didn’t want to be left out of the club.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party. They’re just too afraid to say it out loud.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud. I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him. My own political future is of zero concern.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/

I’ve heard from a retired army medic who looked evil in the eye. When he says we’re heading toward disaster—that American lives are on the line—he knows what he’s talking about. He knows we can’t afford more of the same. That’s why he told me to “give ‘em hell.”,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
I’ve heard from a mom who promised to email me every day and does. She just wants a “return to normalcy.” She wants me to keep running for the sake of her 4-year-old son. She hopes he’ll see the “America she grew up in”—an America that’s strong and proud and united in purpose.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"And I’ve heard from a high-school student, who just last week came to hear me speak. She asked me to sign a note to her teacher explaining her absence. After growing up amid the chaos and anger of the last few years, she finally has hope that America will make it… if we make the right choice.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"I’m constantly hearing from Americans like these—hundreds a day, thousands a week, and hundreds of thousands since I declared my candidacy. They see the same polls as me. But more importantly, they have the same belief as me. They believe in America. They believe America can do so much better—that we must do better. And they know when the country’s future is on the line, you don’t drop out. You keep fighting. In fact, you fight harder than ever.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"That’s why I refuse to quit. South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I’ll still be running for president. I’m not going anywhere.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"I’m campaigning every day, until the last person votes, because I believe in a better America and a brighter future for our kids. Nothing good in life comes easy. I’m willing to take the cuts, the bruises, and the name calling. Because the only way you get to the blessing is by going through the pain.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Dropping out would be the easy route. I’ve never taken the easy route. I’ve been the underdog in every race I’ve ever run. I’ve always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, I’m not just fighting someone bigger than me. I’m fighting for something bigger than myself.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"I’m used to people questioning my intentions, so I’ll make a few things clear.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Some people used to say I was running because I really wanted to be Vice President. I think I’ve pretty well settled that question.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Other people say I’m trying to set up a future presidential run. How does that even work?,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"If I was running for a bogus reason, I would have dropped out a long time ago. The rest of the fellas already did that. They have their own plans. I don’t judge them. But I’m still here. I’m fighting for what I know is right. And I don’t care what the party leaders and political elites want. I’ll keep fighting until the American people close the door.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/

"The presidential primaries have barely begun. Just three states have voted. Three. That’s it. After this weekend, we’ll be at four. That’s not a lot. In the 10 days after South Carolina, another 21 states and territories will vote.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"People have a right to have their voices heard. And they deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don’t rig elections!",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Americans of every belief and background are tired of our national mess. They don’t want more chaos and craziness. They worry about a national collapse.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"If I weren’t in the race, we’d be reading the exact same story every day until November 5. There would be widespread reports of Americans suffering from a bad case of “Biden-Trump fatigue.” And it would be true. A stunning 70% of the country doesn’t want a Biden-Trump rematch. The majority of Americans don’t just dislike one candidate. They dislike both.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"As a country, we’ve never seen such dissatisfaction with the leading candidates. We’ve never had so many Americans mired in pessimism and division. We still have a chance to restore their faith. I will fight as long as that chance exists.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Now, I know what Donald Trump is saying. He wants an election with no opponent. But that’s not what voters are saying. Despite being a de facto incumbent, Donald Trump lost 49% of the vote in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Trump lost 46% of the vote. That’s not good. We’re talking about almost half our voters. What does it say about an incumbent who is losing nearly half his party? It spells disaster in November. We shouldn’t silence these voters, like Trump wants. They have the right to keep speaking out.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Trump sees this. That’s why he and his allies are now trying a different tack. They’re saying I’m helping Joe Biden by staying in.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Let’s unpack that for a second.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"First thing’s first: Joe Biden is doing more damage to himself than any Republican could ever do. Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds like his mind is closing up shop. The Democrats are getting weaker by holding a coronation for Biden. Republicans will get stronger through a vigorous competition.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"We have plenty of time to hash this out. If the race ended today, we’d have the longest general election in history. There are still eight and a half months before Election Day. Do we really want to spend every day from now until November watching America’s two most disliked politicians duke it out?",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
No sane person wants that.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
But there’s another reason Trump is wrong.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/

The Democrats know it. They don’t even try to conceal their glee at the prospect of running against,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Trump. They want to win—so they want the guy they’ve already beaten time and again.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Trump knows it too, but he won’t admit it. True to form, he’s taking out his anger on others. He’s getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He’s trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they’ll be barred from MAGA—permanently. That’s not the way you win elections.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Well, I’ve dealt with bullies my entire life. They don’t intimidate me. They only motivate me further. And I’ve never met a bully I couldn’t take on.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"There are also those who try to paint me as, quote, “Never Trump.” That’s not who I am. Never have been. I supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. I was proud to serve America in his Cabinet. My purpose has never been to stop Trump at all costs.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/

Joe Biden has turned our country upside down. It’s not normal for millions of migrants to illegally cross our border without being stopped. It’s not normal for our schools to be more focused on gender pronouns than reading and math. It’s not normal to have skyrocketing prices and soaring crime. And it’s not normal to have wars raging in Europe and the Middle East.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"All of that is on Joe Biden. But he’s not the only one who’s replaced normalcy with chaos. Donald Trump has done that, too.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
It’s not normal to insult our military heroes and veterans. It’s not normal to spend fifty million dollars in campaign donations on personal court cases. It’s not normal to threaten the people who back your opponent. And it’s not normal to call on Russia to invade NATO countries. Donald Trump has done all that and more in just the last month.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Look, I’ve said it many times — I think Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. But times change—and so has Trump. He’s gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He’s completely distracted. And everything is about him. He’s so obsessed with his own demons from the past, he can’t focus on delivering the future Americans deserve.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
We have two hugely flawed candidates in Biden and Trump. Americans know it. They’ve been saying it for years. And we all know why.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
Trump and Biden are two old men who are only getting older. Nearly 60% of Americans say Trump and Biden are both too old to be president—because they are. We’ve all seen them fumble their words and get confused about world leaders. That’s not who you want in the Oval Office when Russia launches a nuclear weapon at our satellites or China shuts down our electricity grid.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
We’re talking about the most demanding job in human history. You don’t give it to someone who’s at risk of dementia. You give it to someone who is disciplined—someone who can work day and night for eight years straight. No vendettas. No drama. Just results.,,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Even if Trump and Biden weren’t too old—and again, they are—Americans still oppose them because we know what they’ll do. They’ve already done tremendous damage—and they’re just getting started.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Biden has crippled families with years of inflation. He’s put welfare over work and doled out more corporate welfare than any president, ever. Meanwhile, Trump added more to the national debt than any president in history. And it wasn’t because of COVID, no matter how many times he tries that excuse. Now he wants a 10% tax hike on every American. Just like Biden, Trump will devastate families and destroy good-paying jobs.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"We need to shift our economy into overdrive—not reverse. Most importantly, we need a President who protects America.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"Biden has failed this basic duty. As Commander-in-Chief, he tried to cut the military. He’s made us weaker while our enemies get stronger. He withdrew from Afghanistan in a way that encouraged our enemies to do whatever they want. Three years later, Russia has invaded Ukraine. Hamas has murdered Israeli women and children in their beds. China is launching unprecedented cyberattacks on American infrastructure. Iran is killing American soldiers.",,nikkihaley.com,https://nikkihaley.com/2024/02/20/nikki-haley-delivers-state-of-the-race-speech/
"At the same time, Donald Trump has plenty of his own problems on national security. He’s all but said he’ll abandon Ukraine. That’s a massive gift to Vladimir Putin. Now Trump is inviting Putin to invade NATO countries. Those are the same countries that stood with us after September 11th. Of course we should demand they pay more.

"If you’ve ever had a family Thanksgiving turn nuclear after Aunt Helen decided to share her opinion on All Lives Matter during the dessert course, you know it can be extremely difficult to change your loved ones’ minds about deeply held political views. But talking about these subjects with close friends and family doesn’t always lead to slammed screen doors and smashed pie plates. Sometimes these relationships provide a way into perspective-shifting conversations that might otherwise be impossible.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"“There is someone in your life that only you can get through to,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “I need you to use your relationships to get through and check in on people and make sure they’re stepping up and doing the right thing, and they’re not staying home on Election Night, and they’re not giving their vote to Donald Trump.”",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"The Cut talked to seven people about how they got through to that person in their lives — from jaded nonvoters to disillusioned Republicans — and convinced them to cast their vote for Joe Biden this fall. As 15-year-old Claire said of getting her Republican grandma in Florida to vote for Biden, that personal closeness can make all the difference: “She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true.”",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html

"My dad used to be a Republican congressman. Our family always grew up pretty conservative, though it sure feels, as I get older, I’m becoming more liberal, especially with Trump in power.

"My brother’s a retired banker down in Dallas, and he’s ten years older than me. He’s a conservative Republican, he’s a loyal soldier for the party, but he also believes Trump is a moron. He knew he wasn’t gonna vote for Trump this time; he was planning to write in Reagan’s name. And I just started pleading with him, saying, “Texas is in play. The state is so close. And if the Republicans can lose Texas, maybe that’s a wake-up call for them to get their act together.” The Republicans are pulling out every dirty trick they can to suppress voting and try and save this guy’s bacon. And I said, “You can’t just vote for Reagan or Ross Perot and feel good about it.”",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html

"I live in rural Pennsylvania. It’s very red, and I was a big Trump supporter in 2016 when I was in high school. As the years went on, I started to drift away, and I finally turned and got on the Bidenmobile in about September. COVID-19 was kind of the final straw for me. Other countries have beaten this back, and we’re climbing like crazy. I also personally feel like, as someone who studies climate change and someone who is LGBTQ, another four years with Donald Trump in the White House is not the best for a person like me. When I first supported Trump, I did not realize I was LGBTQ, and I wasn’t nearly as much of an environmentalist as I am now.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"My boyfriend and I met in 2019 and started dating this spring. He had been a Trump supporter but was increasingly on the fence, and he was starting to show the early signs of getting annoyed with Trump’s rhetoric. Still, he said he wasn’t going to break his back going to the polls, but if he did manage to go, he was gonna vote Trump, just do a straight red ticket. And then that’s when I kind of threw a lot of persuasion at him.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"It started as a little bit of joking banter, like, “Vote for Biden and I’ll buy you this.” And then eventually, I kind of got to him. I helped him realize that, of the two main options available, Biden was the lesser of two evils. I said, “Do you want to spend the next four years reading angry tweets and opening up Twitter and saying, ‘Oh, what did Trump do now?’” I think the first debate also really helped convince him because Trump spent the entire time attacking Joe Biden’s son and Joe Biden as a person, and I think he felt that Biden at least portrayed an ounce of professionalism that was desperately needed. He kind of just said, “Fine, finally I get it, I’ll do it.” ",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"My son is in the National Guard; he’s 21. He’s like a lot of people in that generation, where they think it doesn’t really matter. He’s pretty progressive, he supported Bernie, and none of his friends are voting, because they don’t like Biden either. But he’s been activated four times now during COVID, for protests in Seattle and for COVID relief, doing testing and food banks, and he’ll be activated for the election, for whatever may or may not happen. In encouraging him to vote, I said, “Remember, you’re also voting for your boss, because we also have a tight gubernatorial race.” I told him, you know, “If we get a conservative governor here, that guy is gonna activate you every time somebody breathes wrong.” He doesn’t want to be at those protests; if he had his way, he’d likely be on the other side of them.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"I’ve voted in every election since I turned 18, but this is his first presidential election. It’s hard to convey to him how different this election is from any other during my lifetime, and he really doesn’t have the luxury of standing idly by, waiting for a better candidate. He got his ballot, and I was like, “Are you gonna fill it out?” I said, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, but this is why I really want you to vote for Biden.” And he did it.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"My grandma lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She has been a Republican pretty much her whole life, but she did not agree with what Trump was doing with COVID, because she’s older and she’s immunocompromised. I FaceTime her every Sunday for about an hour. A year ago, we didn’t really talk about politics. But in the past couple months, I’ve been trying to incorporate it a little bit more because I had a feeling that she wasn’t going to vote. I tried to show her that not everyone has benefited from Trump being president. For example, she is upper class, and my mom and dad and brother are not, and I kind of showed her that not taxing everyone equally is not effective. And she said she never thought about how taxing the upper class would be helpful to everybody else.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html

"Recently, she told me that she was going to vote for Biden because she believes Trump is evil and it’s the right thing to do, not only thinking about herself but thinking about everybody. It was awesome.
Me and her have gotten really close. And I think that us being really close really helped me convince her, because she trusts me and respects my opinion. She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"I tried to get my dad to vote blue in 2016. I don’t think that worked — he still hasn’t really said who he voted for, but I think he has pretty much always voted Republican. Since then, anytime I thought Trump did something dumb, I would try to start a conversation, and that didn’t really work. But as this election got closer, I was really trying to tell him about how important it would be for my future and potentially my kids’ future if I have kids. Millennials have this idea that it’s not ethical to necessarily bring kids into the world when there are politicians in office that don’t believe in climate change. He thought that idea was really out there, and he said he couldn’t believe I thought that way. He thought that’s kind of a crazy way to think about having kids, like it doesn’t really matter who’s in office, you’re gonna live your life. Marrying those things together, I think, was probably a new concept for him. He did definitely push back and say that’s not the way to think about having kids, and I said, “Well, that’s the way that I’m thinking about it, and you could help with this if you voted for Biden. That would be a step in the right direction.”  ",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"While he was never interested in talking about me having grandkids before, the past few years he has kind of been asking me what’s going on. Prior to that, I would have never thought that could be a way in. My mom sent me a photo of his completed ballot [for Biden]; he wouldn’t send it to me. I think he’s still begrudgingly doing it, and that doesn’t feel great, but I guess a win’s a win.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html

"My sister hasn’t voted in over 30 years. She does watch TV, but because Trump has so dominated the airwaves, she’s just sick and tired of it. She was just frustrated by his childish behavior. And I said, “Let’s do something about it. You need to go vote.” And she’s like, “Dan, I haven’t voted in years, and I’m blind.” She actually went blind this past year because of diabetes, and she’s only gone blind in the last six or seven months so she’s still struggling with how to live this way. So I printed off the Missouri absentee ballot application and sent her hard copies of it, and I walked her through the ballot and explained how to get it submitted in Missouri and all that. And because I went to the effort to make it easier for her, she was motivated to follow through, but I did have to lead her every step of the way.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html

Of course, Trump has changed that.",,www.thecut.com,https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html
"I sort of explained to her what’s happening around the world and showed how fascism and authoritarianism are rising up everywhere, like Hungary, Poland, Brazil, Turkey, India, and I started naming off all the countries that have fallen to authoritarian regimes over the last decade and kind of brought it back home. One of my children has Jewish heritage, and one of my children has Muslim heritage and I sort of explained to her how terrified I am for them. We’re applying, through my husband, for Italian citizenship. That’s how scared we are.

Really the only way I’ve been able to reach people is “If you believe this is happening, or if you believe it could be happening, and if you love me, don’t you care about what that’s gonna mean?” Because our family, I feel like, is in a particularly vulnerable spot.

"The Jews backing the Uncommitted campaign — which is also called Listen to Michigan — are part of a fast-growing movement, initiated by local Arab American activists, that hopes to send a message to the White House about its Israel policy.

"“I think that there is an assumption from the Biden administration, as well as many others in power, that they can count on Jewish support and the Jewish vote as things carry on in this way in Gaza,” Eleanor Gamalski, a local Jewish organizer who headed up the phone bank, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “Many Jews that I know would object to that.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Gamalski is the deputy director of Detroit Jews for Justice, a social justice nonprofit, and a onetime staffer for Andy Levin, the Jewish former Democratic congressman and member of a Michigan political dynasty. But her participation in the Uncommitted campaign is on her own behalf. She’s a longtime friend of Abbas Alawieh, a Lebanese American Democratic strategist who helped launch the campaign alongside Layla Elabed, sister of Detroit Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American and the House’s most vocal Israel critic.

"To Gamalski, the movement seemed like a perfect opportunity to push for policies her progressive Jewish network wants: namely, a ceasefire in Gaza, an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian security prisoners, and a commitment “to stop sending U.S. weapons and dollars to fund this genocide.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Michigan is one of a handful of key swing states that helped determine the last two presidential elections, in one case by a razor-thin margin: Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by only about 10,000 votes. The Uncommitted campaign hopes to demonstrate it has at least that number of supporters, a large enough bloc to potentially swing the state and force Biden’s attention.

"Campaign organizers declined to tell JTA how many people had signed its pledge. But Arab and Muslim Americans have been warning for months that their communities could withhold their votes from Biden over Gaza. With an estimated more than 300,000 Arab Americans in the state along with assorted allies, the 10,000 mark seems plausible to reach. (Getting to Biden’s margin of victory in 2020, more than 150,000, would be more difficult.)",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"At least some Jewish voters will be part of the count — including, possibly, Levin himself. He told JTA he’s backing the Uncommitted campaign precisely because he wants to ensure Biden takes Michigan in November. He doesn’t think the president’s current course on Israel will cut it: not just for Arab and Muslim Americans, but also for other constituencies like Black churches, which have become increasingly vocal in their calls for a ceasefire.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"“I’m betting on Joe Biden to find a way to become a peacemaker in Israel and Palestine, so that people can vote for him later,” Levin said. “I feel like this is existential for Joe Biden’s political survival. I don’t see how he wins reelection without winning Michigan, and I don’t see how he wins Michigan without changing course.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Levin isn’t the only big progressive voice supporting the campaign. Our Revolution, an activist group founded by progressive Jewish Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 and currently chaired by Jewish labor activist Larry Cohen, also announced this week that it would encourage its 87,000 Michigan followers to vote Uncommitted to “push Biden to change course on Gaza now.” ",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Michigan is also home to a Jewish community of around 100,000, and its big Jewish institutions and personalities — including Temple Israel, the nation’s largest Reform congregation, as well as a politically connected yeshiva and a former president of AIPAC — remain staunchly pro-Israel. A poll from November showed that most American Jews back Biden’s approach to the conflict, and previous polls have shown that most U.S. Jews have an affinity for Israel.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"The Detroit JCRC/AJC, the local federation’s community relations arm, told JTA it would not be issuing any public comment on the Uncommitted campaign. And the campaign is new enough that some major figures in the state’s Jewish community told JTA they had not heard a lot about it — though they were not happy about what they learned.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"“Any effort that takes votes away from Joe Biden will only benefit Donald Trump, and job one is to make sure he doesn’t become president,” Mark Jacobs, a local liberal AIPAC supporter who also co-founded the Detroit Coalition for Black and Jewish Unity, told JTA. Jacobs — who has done significant outreach to Detroit-area Black churches since the outbreak of war on Oct. 7 and is preparing to launch a leadership academy this month for Black and Jewish teenagers — didn’t know about the Uncommitted campaign; he said he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the coalition or AIPAC.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"When he found out about the campaign, Jacobs said he didn’t think a successful Uncommitted initiative would change many Jewish votes in Michigan, even if Biden took a more aggressive posture toward Israel as a result of the pressure.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"“Arguably, there may be a sliver of Jewish voters who are a bit on the fence about Biden and maybe if he becomes more vocal during the political season, saying things that are not embraced by many members of the Jewish community, then that could have an impact to some extent,” he said. “But I’m just so fixated on the god-awful harm that would be caused by a Trump presidency.” ",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Few are as familiar with navigating intra-Jewish politics in the state as Levin himself, who lost a primary race for his redrawn House seat in 2022 after pro-Israel groups unhappy with his policies spent more than $4 million to back his non-Jewish opponent over him. Still, Levin insisted, Biden “doesn’t have to worry about the Jewish vote, I don’t think.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"In an acknowledgement of the growing pressure on him regarding Israel, Biden’s team met recently with Arab leaders in the state to apologize for “missteps” in his handling of the war, including not more forcefully advocating for Palestinian lives. Alawieh said he interpreted this as referring to the president’s public statements, not his actual Israel policies.

"“Senior Biden officials were talking about the mistakes as more of a messaging problem,” Alawieh told reporters during a Listen to Michigan press briefing last week. “But what was absent from what they were saying was any commitment to push even privately for a ceasefire that saves lives.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Asked by JTA what it would take for him to come back around on Biden before November, Alawieh said he wanted to see the president “apply the most basic levels of accountability to condition military funding” to Israel. Elabed said she would need to see “a permanent ceasefire” before she would even consider voting for Biden.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Many in Michigan and beyond aren’t thrilled with the campaign’s goals. “This is how Trump becomes president again,” reads a typical comment on the Listen to Michigan Instagram, a concern also echoed by Michigan’s popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. ",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"“A potential second term for the former president would be very hard on all the communities that are still being impacted by what’s happening overseas as well, and that’s something that shouldn’t be lost on people’s calculation, too,” Whitmer told reporters Thursday.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"Gamalski rejects that argument. “I think the Biden administration, if they are to lose to Trump in November, it’s because of the choices that they have made and the courage they failed to exhibit in standing up to the weapons industry and in calling for a stop to this war,” she said.

"Organizers insist the campaign only applies to the primary (in contrast to another local campaign, Abandon Biden, encouraging Michigan voters to stay home altogether in November). Yet many members are noncommittal about how they’ll vote in the general. One of Listen to Michigan’s Instagram posts suggests the campaign could hurt Biden more than just symbolically.

"“Uncommitted is the best strategy because it not only takes votes away from Biden but removes delegates from him if we can get to a 15% threshold,” the post reads. “If Biden doesn’t get enough delegates nationally he doesn’t get the nomination.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"And then there’s the fact that some of the loudest voices pushing for an Uncommitted vote have also praised Hamas or downplayed the extent of the atrocities it committed on Oct. 7. Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, headquartered in Dearborn, said at an October rally, “We are not going to be intimidated by staying silent when they say Hamas is a terrorist organization.” He was in the meeting with Biden officials and has endorsed the Uncommitted campaign, saying, “Vote for anyone you want to vote for, but don’t vote for Biden because he is complacent in the crime against Palestinians.”",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html
"The Jews backing the campaign acknowledge the presence of views like Silbani’s but say it doesn’t change their support. Levin said it’s “all the more reason to get in there and hold up a banner of integrity and of sanity,” to prove that not everyone backing a ceasefire is a Hamas supporter.",,www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html

"“It’s really evident to me that the folks organizing this are concerned about bringing about a better future for everyone, including Jews,” she said. “I know that folks in this coalition have shown up for me and spoken out against antisemitism, and they don’t compartmentalize their work on any one oppression.

Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.,,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior reporter): It’s finally official: President Biden is running for reelection. After months of teasing a potential bid for a second term, he dropped a prerecorded video on April 25 saying that his 2024 campaign has officially begun.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"In that announcement, Biden started to make his own pitch for another four years. “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer,” he said in the video. And while he didn’t name any rivals, pictures of Republican opponents — like former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — flashed on the screen as he spoke.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"Without a serious primary challenger (yet, anyway), potential GOP opponents are clearly on Biden’s mind. But the Republican primary is just getting off the ground. So let’s talk about which potential GOP candidate would be Biden’s most formidable opponent. Which Republican, even if they haven’t officially announced yet — looking at you, DeSantis — has the best chance of beating Biden, based on what we know now?",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh (Kaleigh Rogers, politics reporter): Here’s my hot take for 2024: Biden has a better shot against some of the front-runners like Trump and DeSantis than against one of the currently-less-hot candidates. He’s an incumbent candidate whose approval rating is nothing to write home about, even among Democrats. There’s a serious risk of Democrats feeling apathetic about this election, especially if the candidate is someone they assume Biden will beat.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"But if Trump or DeSantis is the nominee, the prospect of one of those candidates winning could be enough to scare Democrats into showing up at the polls. For better or worse, polarization means our elections are as much about whom voters don’t want as much as they are about whom they do want: One survey found that as many as one-third of voters in 2020 said they were voting against a candidate rather than for the one they chose. Biden may benefit if he’s running against someone whom Democrats view as a threat.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/

"nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior elections analyst): Oh, interesting, Kaleigh! I was thinking about this question in terms of Trump versus DeSantis. But that’s probably too closed-minded of me. Although it would be a pretty huge upset for someone polling as low as former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to win the GOP nomination, it’s very possible they would be stronger general-election candidates than either Trump or DeSantis because they are more temperamentally moderate.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: Right, and I think a more moderate candidate comes with a dual risk: Democratic voters will either think Biden can beat a moderate, or they’re OK with the possibility that he won’t.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: In fact, I’ll go a step further and say that, of the candidates in the race right now, Haley would be the strongest general-election candidate. There is credible daylight between her and Trump(ism) on issues like election denialism (she criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol). And fairly or not, the fact that she’s a woman of color would likely make her seem more moderate. Political science research tells us that Republican women, especially women of color, are perceived as more moderate than conservative, which can be a problem in primaries but a potential help in general elections.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, senior elections analyst): That all makes sense to me. However, while it’s early, there is only a small chance that someone besides Trump or DeSantis wins the GOP presidential nomination. We know early primary polls are actually fairly predictive, so to have those two candidates so far ahead of the rest of the field at this point makes it hard — though not impossible — to see anyone else facing Biden. So the question, to Nathaniel’s point, is mostly about which of those two has a better chance of defeating Biden. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"ameliatd: OK, so if we’re talking about which candidate with a realistic shot of actually being the nominee has the best chance of beating Biden — who is it? Trump or DeSantis? And yes, I know DeSantis isn’t officially in the race yet — but let’s assume he is.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: I think it’s DeSantis. He managed to win reelection in Florida last year by 20 points! That was very impressive; Florida has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of only R+7. And yes, I know he was running against a flawed candidate in Democratic former Rep. Charlie Crist, but that’s likely only part of the story.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"In addition, virtually all evidence indicates that Trump is a big electoral drag on his own, and for the GOP. He won in 2016 only by the skin of his teeth, and that was against a historically unpopular Democratic candidate in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"And then, of course, he lost in 2020 to Biden, who will likely be his (or DeSantis’s) opponent again in 2024. And the candidates he endorsed did really poorly in the 2022 general election, too. An analysis from The Economist estimated that they did 5 percentage points worse than a non-Trump-endorsed candidate would have. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: I tend to agree that DeSantis is a somewhat better bet against Biden than Trump. He’s not as well-known as Trump and he tends to have a better net favorability rating among Republicans than the former president in most polls, usually because fewer Republicans have a negative opinion of DeSantis. If he can maintain that favorability edge even as he becomes better-known, DeSantis could wind up doing a better job of retaining most Republican support in the general election, whereas Trump’s controversial record could result in him losing a small number of Republicans to Biden — and in a close election, that could matter.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"Additionally, Trump polls quite poorly among independents, so DeSantis could be a chance for the GOP to get a fresh start with this group. I’m not sure how much better than Trump he could do — to Kaleigh’s earlier point, high levels of polarization have made this a game of inches when it comes to substantially shifting the electorate toward one party or the other. But I do think DeSantis is likely to perform better than Trump.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: Totally. The reality is that Biden beat Trump once before, and I’m not convinced anything has shifted in Trump’s favor since then. In fact, I think things look worse for Trump. Jan. 6 poured a lot of cold water on the MAGA movement, and the scandals that have followed (the multiple investigations, the indictment, the mishandled classified documents), while temporarily boosting good will for Trump among Republicans, may make GOP voters ultimately see him as too much of a liability.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: I do want to reemphasize Geoffrey’s point about polarization, though. When we’re talking about which candidate is more “electable,” chances are their advantage is only a couple percentage points. Though, in a close election, that could matter …",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"ameliatd: But, OK — what happens to Trump’s enthusiastic fan base within the GOP if DeSantis wins? Is it possible they just don’t turn out for DeSantis?",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: DeSantis is very Trumpy. I don’t think they’re going to have much trouble turning out for him against Biden. Granted, we don’t know what Trump would do if he lost the GOP nomination — he might hold a serious grudge and try to actively undermine his party’s campaign.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: A lot of Trump’s loyalists would likely pivot and rally behind DeSantis. He has enough of the anti-woke bona fides to scratch that itch for the MAGA base. But I think some will drop off. Trump inspired a meaningful number of nonvoters to turn out to the polls for the first time in years, and many of those voters may fall back out of the electorate if the GOP candidate lacks the fiery charisma of Trump. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"And on the flip side, Geoff, if Trump rallies behind DeSantis (not his typical M.O. but he’s nothing if not surprising), that could be all the boost DeSantis needs to secure the base after the primary.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: Yeah, despite Trump’s attacks on DeSantis, Trump primary voters so far still have a strongly positive opinion of the Florida governor. According to Morning Consult, 47 percent of Trump voters identified DeSantis as their second choice for president. Only 27 percent identified a different candidate, and the actual “never-DeSantis” crowd is probably even smaller than that. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"Also, just in general, the idea that dissatisfied primary voters don’t end up voting for their party’s nominee in the end is overrated. Almost all of them will end up voting for the GOP nominee just to stop Biden. For example, in the 2008 exit polls, 89 percent of Democrats said they voted for former President Barack Obama even after his bruising primary fight with Clinton that year. That number (around 90 percent) is pretty typical in terms of same-party vote share.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
ameliatd: But what happens if DeSantis goes so far right in the primary that he’s in basically the same position as Trump with independents? I am going to force one of you to take Trump seriously as a contender against Biden!,,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: Oh, it’s not that we don’t take Trump seriously. He could very well defeat Biden. I just think there’s good reason to see DeSantis as having a higher ceiling than Trump in a general election.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: Yeah, Amelia, I do think that could happen. DeSantis isn’t even in the race yet. I’m just talking about where things stand right now. But I do think DeSantis would have to do a lot of extreme stuff to develop a brand as toxic with independents as Trump’s.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"That said, he has been working overtime to develop that uber-conservative record. The type of six-week abortion ban that he recently signed into law, for example, is unpopular nationwide. (According to a recent Fox News poll, 52 percent of Americans would oppose a six-week abortion ban in their state, and only 44 percent would support it.) And if abortion remains as big an issue in 2024 as it was in 2022, that could put him behind the eight ball.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: Yeah, I think we’re all trying to choose between three not-particularly-stellar candidates, and this early in the game, there’s a case to be made for Trump, Biden or DeSantis coming out on top.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"ameliatd: OK, so let’s talk about Trump. What would have to happen for him to be a stronger contender against Biden than DeSantis? Because Nathaniel’s right — it’s early, and DeSantis is unproven on the national stage.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: DeSantis certainly does have plenty of potential negatives. He may go so far to the right with an eye on the primary that he’ll be vulnerable in a general election. So even if he might be a better pick for the GOP than Trump, the differences here are not necessarily that large.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"And some might turn to the polls to argue Trump is stronger. I took an average of general election polls of registered or likely voters in April, and on average Trump’s margin against Biden was a couple of points better than DeSantis’s. However, we also know that Trump has basically universal name recognition, whereas DeSantis is well known but not to the extent Trump is. As a result, surveys asking about the Florida governor tend to have more undecideds, which may be aiding Trump in this comparison.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"Moreover, while primary polls conducted in the first half of the year before the election have some predictive power, general election polls at this point are not worth very much. It’s not usually until the spring of the election year that general election polls start to have meaningful explanatory power for the eventual November outcome, which makes sense: That’s about the time we start to get a firmer idea of what the general election matchup could look like. And given the small margins in most recent elections, even minor swings closer to November could matter, so there’s still a long way to go.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: Part of it could come down to the campaign itself. Biden is 80. He’ll turn 81 late this year. He’s not the same candidate he was in 2020. If his campaign isn’t energetic enough, it could prompt voters to stay home or even feel willing to give Trump another shot, especially if Trump is campaigning well and avoiding some of the bigger gaffes of past elections. Again, we’re talking about slim margins here that could make the difference.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: Right, to Kaleigh’s point, there are also a bunch of unknowns, like the state of the economy, scandals, war and other factors that could influence the trajectory of the general election later.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: Yes, Kaleigh, I think that’s a key point. According to a YouGov/Yahoo News poll from February, 68 percent of registered voters said Biden is too old to start another term as president. But Trump himself is 76! Meanwhile, DeSantis is only 44 years old, he has a young family, etc. I know this is super pundit-y, but given how unpredictive the early polls are at this stage, I think it’s as good a theory as any: The age contrast between DeSantis and Biden could benefit DeSantis in a general election.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: That seems possible, Nathaniel, although Biden could come out firing in a debate with the line Ronald Reagan used in 1984 against Walter Mondale (who was in his mid-50s but still 17 years younger than Reagan): “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.”",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
kaleigh: A classic debate zinger!,,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: Reagan was the last president to face serious questions about his age and mental acuity, so the comparison to Biden seems apt.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"kaleigh: And, compared to 80-year-old Biden and 76-year-old Trump, Reagan was a spry 73 at the time!",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"ameliatd: So it sounds like one big question mark here is Biden himself. And he’ll have to run a very different campaign than he did in 2020 — simply because we were deeply in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic then, and nobody could campaign. But what do Republican voters think? Do they view one candidate as more electable than the other?",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"nrakich: Yes, Amelia, so far, Republican voters think Trump is more electable than DeSantis! According to Morning Consult, 54 percent of potential GOP primary voters think Trump has the best chance of beating Biden, while only 25 percent said DeSantis. I don’t know if that’s because of name recognition, or because many Republican voters still believe Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, or some other reason, but it’s definitely the opposite of what I would have expected.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, Nathaniel. It’s also not clear how much electability even matters to Republican voters. Polls have varied, but a March survey from CNN found that 59 percent of Republicans and independents who leaned Republican said they preferred a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, compared with 41 percent who preferred one who had a strong chance of defeating Biden. Meanwhile, 63 percent of Republican adults told YouGov/The Economist in mid-April that agreeing with a candidate on the issues was more important than their chances in the general election; only 23 percent said the latter was more critical. ",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/
"However, another mid-April poll from Impact Research and Fabrizio, Lee & Associates on behalf of the Wall Street Journal found 51 percent preferred a candidate with the best chance of winning the general even if they disagreed on some issues versus 44 percent who wanted to agree with the candidate on everything even if the candidate would have a tougher time winning in November. The wording and results in these polls differ to some extent, but regardless, there definitely isn’t a huge majority of Republicans who are prioritizing winning over the issues.",,fivethirtyeight.com,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-republican-candidate-should-biden-be-most-afraid-of/

The summer before an election year is not always kind to first-term Democrats. ,,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"In August of 1995 Bob Dole led Bill Clinton. In the summer of 2011, the public's ""grim views"" of the economy, we said at the time, pushed Barack Obama's disapproval to its then-highest point. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"That both presidents recovered and went on to reelection may give Democrats hope, because right now Joe Biden and the Democratic Party face major challenges of their own. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"And those Democrats won't find any solace in this: today Mr. Biden is down one point, and inside the margin of error, in a match-up with Donald Trump, whom he beat by seven million votes three years ago.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"With most voters unsure he'd stay through a second term if he did get one, and their concerns about whether Mr. Biden is healthy enough, it's all adding uncertainty for an already unsettled public. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"That's about looking ahead, while Trump benefits from a strong retrospective view: almost all his voters believe ""things were better"" under him. The voters who feel they're worse off financially today are certainly voting as if that's the case.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"It's not clear to voters that they'd get a full second Biden term if he won one, and that uncertainty is not helping him.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

Those who think Mr. Biden would leave during a second term are going 84% for Trump.,,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

Voters are far more likely to think only Trump — and not Mr. Biden — has the cognitive and mental health to serve. (Nearly a quarter think neither of them does.),,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

It's not exactly a matchup people are clamoring for: A big majority says getting a Biden-Trump rematch already means the political system is broken. ,,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

"For the third of voters who don't think either of them is physically healthy enough to serve, this may also be a contest they didn't want.

"Each candidate has their party feeling somewhat — but not completely — assured of victory. Partisans each think they've got a better-than-even shot next fall. That's important for context with the primaries — in the GOP primaries right now, Republican voters think Donald Trump is their most electable candidate; in 2020 Democrats thought that of Mr. Biden.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

"One of the administration's efforts has been to tout what it sees as Mr. Biden's accomplishments. A lot of voters do know about some key efforts, and it matters. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"For example, independents who have heard about the Biden administration investing in infrastructure and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices are backing him, but those independents who have not heard about those things are voting for Trump. ",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"But the Biden administration's efforts to reduce student loan debt has left few voters satisfied.

Democratic efforts to try to portray the Republicans as too extreme don't seem to be playing to Democratic advantage because Democrats are described by just as many as extreme. ,,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
And there's just not a lot of differentiation between them.,,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/

"More than half of likely independent voters think Democratic stands on diversity go too far, and think the Democrats pay too much attention to those trying to be ""politically correct.""

"Republicans, for their part, get called ""extreme"" by people who think the GOP pays too much attention to ""MAGA"" supporters, and by people who think abortion should be legal, not illegal.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"Abortion helped the Democrats' chances in the midterms, and it sets up a potential edge for Mr. Biden. On net, views on abortion push voters toward the Democrats.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"And impeachment proceedings in Congress don't seem to have much sway here, at least for now - it's just a (very typical) partisan split over whether the House GOP ought to try to impeach Biden over matters concerning his son Hunter Biden.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"Mr. Biden's campaign might look to make this more of choice than a straight referendum on Mr. Biden.

"Trump, for his part, draws more direct support as motivation.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"Almost all of Donald Trump's voters expressly give as their rationale that ""things were better under Trump."" It's a lot more than the number who say it's because they like him personally.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"Mr. Biden may be disadvantaged right now because key parts of his 2020 coalition aren't as tuned in to the campaign yet. Black and Hispanic voters say they are less likely to be thinking about 2024 compared to White voters, and less likely (though it's a year off) to say they'll vote.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"But for the moment, for those who will, Mr. Biden isn't running quite as strongly right now with key Democratic constituencies he'd need. He still wins Hispanics, but with 53%, and typically successful Democrats have gotten into the 60s. By two to one, more Hispanic voters say they're worse off financially, rather than better off, than they were before the pandemic. Mr.  Biden still overwhelmingly wins Black voters, but at 81%, it's less than exit polls showed in 2020. Typically Democrats do better.

"Each of Biden and Trump's 2020 voters are overwhelmingly supporting them again this time around, so small shifts matter. Biden today is losing 7% of those who backed him in 2020 to Trump. Trump only gives up 3% of his.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"It's long been a misnomer when independents are conflated with swing voters. In reality most so-called ""independents"" say they vote mainly for one party, even though they call themselves independent. Only a relative handful of them — just a third — are truly independent and vote equally for either party over time. These make a good barometer: Mr. Biden is losing our ""truly independent"" definition today by 20 points. He was almost even with them in their 2020 votes.",,www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-poll-2023-09-17/
"Education gaps still hold — and even define — the race as they did in 2020: Mr. Biden maintains his small lead among White college-degree voters, as he had in 2020, and his large deficit with White non-college voters is roughly the same.

Whether Biden can overcome those problems isn’t knowable. But we can know how his campaign intends to try. The strategy is already visible in his campaign speeches.

"It’s also a safe bet that few people who voted for Trump or Biden in 2020 will change their minds. Out of 158 million who voted, some will switch sides, but switching is rare.

"But low levels of approval might not turn into votes against the incumbent.

"At a Veterans Day campaign event in New Hampshire, the former president held forth for an hour and 45 minutes, referring to his opponents as “vermin” whom he vowed to “root out,” calling himself a “proud election denier” and promising to “begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” if reelected. Notably, although much of what Trump said was ad libbed, those lines each appeared to be part of the prepared remarks he read off a TelePrompter.",,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2023-11-17/i-write-about-polls-heres-why-they-cant-tell-you-who-will-win-essential-politics

"“Our very democracy is at stake because the same man who proclaimed himself to be a ‘proud election denier’ ... is running on a platform to end democracy as we know it, and he’s not even hiding the ball,” Biden said.

"Throughout Trump’s political career, he’s done best when news coverage focused on his opponent, as it did on Clinton during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign. He loves the spotlight, but tends to repel voters when he’s in it. For Biden, keeping the attention focused on Trump may provide a fruitful path toward recovery.

"Early primary results indicate that the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be a rematch of the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with voters choosing between someone who would be the country’s oldest president (Biden) or its second-oldest president (Trump).",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
Many voters are unhappy with the choice. An ABC News/Ipsos poll earlier this month found 59% of Americans think both presumptive nominees are too old to serve another term.,,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"“Every indication seems to be that most Americans are not looking forward to a replay of 2020,” University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock told VOA. “If either party could come up with a quality, younger nominee, that person would win by a landslide.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"“Are we voting for two men who are in their 80s, or are we voting for the people they’ve chosen to be their vice presidents?” she added. “The chance they won’t be able to finish their term because of dementia, senility or other health reasons isn’t unbelievable. Something in our system is broken, and we have to fix it.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"“For many of us, it feels like a Back to the Future situation,” he told VOA, referencing the 1985 movie. “It’s a choice between the same two old guys we had last time, and a lot of Americans are left wondering how this happened and if it means something is wrong with our democracy.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
Collins says the candidates’ advanced ages are an inconvenient accident rather than a trend.,,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"“I don’t think anyone in the last few election cycles has said, ‘Let’s go look for the oldest guys!’” he said and laughed. “Rather, it just so happened that Trump’s message resonated most among Republicans, and that Biden was the compromise candidate from a 2020 primary field crowded with younger Democratic candidates.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
The University of Georgia’s Bullock believes structures of the American political system are partly to blame for candidates trending older.,,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"“Some of this problem has to be attributed to the way Congress is elected,” he said. “Gerrymandering has created less competitive districts. That, in combination with no congressional term limits, means you have politicians who can stay in office for decades without ever being seriously challenged. The result is that much of our country’s leadership, not just our presidential candidates, are older.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
Potential impact,,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"“Just as age shouldn’t be an issue in any workplace when it doesn’t affect capacity, it shouldn’t matter in politics either,” she told VOA. “Rather, we should vote on traits like character, empathy and trustworthiness.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"Rodrigues says the rematch between two older candidates is not indicative of a broken political system, though it does highlight a flaw.",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"“I think it illustrates a lack of political engagement among younger generations of Americans,” she explained. “Maybe it’s caused by a deep disappointment with the candidates, or with what their elected officials have been able to accomplish after taking office.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"The ABC News/Ipsos poll that found 59% of Americans think both candidates are too old, and an additional 27% said only Biden is too old.

"“Whether it’s fair or not, I think Biden reads to Americans as being older than Trump,” explained Collins from Dillard University. “His walk is a little stiffer, his speech is a little slower, and he’s more soft-spoken than Trump. It’s an issue his campaign needs to figure out how to fix.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"Democratic voter Deborah Theobald from the U.S. state of Georgia says age “is definitely a big issue for me in this election, but apparently these two are all we’ve got to choose between.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html
"“So maybe we should talk about competency instead,” she continued. “Biden surrounds himself with great people, and he has a vice president who, should she have to take over, is prepared. Trump, on the other hand, tried to hang his last vice president during his January 6 insurrection, and is overall incompetent at hiring. That’s why I’m voting for Biden.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"“I think the Republican Party needs a new face to lead the party, which is why I’ll vote for Nikki Haley in the primary,” Dani told VOA. “But if Trump beats her, you had better believe I’ll vote for him in the general election. This election, and getting rid of Biden and the Democrats, is too important to skip.”",,www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html

"Alexandra Samuels, a senior editor at Texas Monthly covering politics, and Mark Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, broke down some of the state’s biggest primary races. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas

"Texas Standard: Now, before we get into the state races, let’s talk some presidential politics here. Former President Trump is leading in all the polls, from what we can tell. But Nikki Haley, I understand, made some campaign stops in Texas. Alex, did you pick up on any message to voters here? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
Alexandra Samuels: Yes. So Haley pitched herself as the best person to vote for if people want to see something new.,,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"So for at least the past year or so now, voters across the nation have told pollsters that they don’t want a repeat of the 2020 election, meaning they don’t want to see Biden versus Trump again, even though that’s looking more and more likely. But Haley was telling Texas voters that if they really do want to go in another direction, she’s the best and really only candidate for them.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Plus, Texas is an open primary state, and Haley’s implied previously that she wants Democratic and independent voters to cross over and cast ballots in the GOP primary to cut into Trump’s lead here.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"The problem with her message is that it’s falling on deaf ears, or at least it seems to be. So, Mark, I believe it was your poll from the University of Houston that gave Trump like a 60 percentage point lead.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Mark Jones: Yeah, it was 80% to 19%.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Wow. That’s remarkable. I remember we talked about that a little bit earlier, but, professor, what do you think about that open primary aspect of this race? I mean, is it possible we’ll see a lot of Democrats perhaps moving to support Haley, given her direct appeal to them? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Mark Jones: That’s very doubtful. We tend to not have that much crossover voting. And effectively for many Democrats, while they would prefer Haley to Trump, they prefer Joe Biden than Nikki Haley. And so they’re very unlikely to get involved in the primary.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"For it to work it, requires perhaps Nikki Haley doing a concerted outreach effort among Democrats and independents. But the more you do something like that, the more it boomerangs on you and causes Republicans to desert you. So Haley’s in a really difficult situation. She faces a primary in her home state of South Carolina on the 24th, where she’s likely to lose by 30 points.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Right now, the message she gave us in Texas was she’s going to stay in till the bitter end and she is the last person standing, but it’s going to be tougher and tougher for her to stay in the race if she is delivered a shellacking in her home state of South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday does very poorly, as seems to be the case.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"It seems like there’s another major race we should turn our attention to, maybe the biggest in Texas right now – the Senate primary race, on the Democratic side. This, by the way, for the seat that’s currently held by incumbent Ted Cruz on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, you have a very crowded field with frontrunners Colin Allred and Roland Gutierrez. Alex, what are you looking for in that race? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Alexandra Samuels: I’m interested to see whether this race will go into a runoff. And just on the polling we’ve seen, I’d say that’s incredibly likely.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Allred, of course, has this huge fundraising advantage over everyone else in the field. And I’ve seen over the last couple of days that he’s racked up pretty notable endorsements from a number of editorial boards. But still, there’s a large chunk of voters who don’t know who he is and perhaps more notably, don’t know who they’re going to support in the race.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"So in a recent story I wrote on the race, we cited a January poll from Emerson College which showed Allred netting only 29% support, compared with Gutierrez’s 7%. But the number that stood out to me is that 37% of respondents were still undecided in this race, with just a few weeks out.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas

"Mark, I want to turn to you about this race in the Houston area, the 18th Congressional district. Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee running again after her loss for Houston mayor. Some are saying this primary could be her most competitive in years. Is that how you see it? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Mark Jones: Oh, definitely. I mean, this is really the most competitive primary she has had since her first one back in 1994, when she actually won the seat for the first time. She’s challenged by Amanda Edwards, a former city council member who’s out-fundraised the congresswoman and I think is in striking distance.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"It’s one of those races where the congresswoman – that’s Sheila Jackson Lee as we referred to her in Houston, ‘the congresswoman’ – she has a substantial base of support that’s very loyal and very, very likely to turn out for. But if Amanda Edwards can get more nontraditional voters, younger voters and Anglo voters in this African American-majority district to turn out in larger numbers, she has a realistic chance of defeating Jackson Lee. And since there’s a third minor candidate in the race, there’s always the possibility that this goes to a may runoff.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"But this is clearly the biggest threat that Jackson Lee has ever had. And it’s ironic in that the only reason why Amanda Edwards is running against Sheila Jackson Lee is that Sheila Jackson Lee ran for mayor. And had she won, then there wouldn’t have been an issue. But since she lost, now she’s facing Amanda Edwards because Amanda Edwards was running for mayor, but left the race when Sheila Jackson Lee entered it.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Alex, let’s talk about Congressional District 26 – a North Texas seat, made vacant by retiring Michael Burgess, a Republican. Very crowded field. What can you tell us about it? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Alexandra Samuels: It is a very crowded field. In total, there are 11 candidates running in the GOP primary, and many of them have pretty impressive resumes.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"So Luisa Del Rosal, for instance, previously helped lead the office of Rep. Tony Gonzalez in the 23rd Congressional district. Scott Armey, the former Denton County judge, is also in the race. But right now, the frontrunner to replace Burgess is a 29-year-old newcomer named Brandon Gill.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"So you might not have heard of Gill before, but you almost certainly have heard of his father-in-law, Dinesh D’Souza. So Gill has the endorsement of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and is pitching himself sort of as an extension of the former president. So he cited fortifying the border wall as a principal policy objective of his, which in his telling, means deporting migrants that he says Biden has brought into the country.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"But again, with so many candidates, it’s very likely this race will go into a runoff. And what’s also complicating this race is the presence of another hard-charging social conservative on the ballot, and that’s John Huffman. He’s the mayor of Southlake, and he’s trailing very closely behind Gill in terms of fundraising and endorsements.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas

"And, professor, I want to move to District 23. Alex mentioned immigration. And of course, this has been prominent and a big part of the conversation leading up to the primary. This district covers like 800 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, including Eagle Pass. It also includes Uvalde. Republican Congressman Tony Gonzalez currently holds that seat on Capitol Hill, but is facing criticism from within his own party – even being censured by the GOP in 2023. What do you see in here? ",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Mark Jones: Well, Gonzalez took many positions, particularly in 2023 and 2022, that were in the moderate realm in that he voted, for instance, for gun control legislation after the Uvalde massacre. He’s one of the few Republicans to do so. And he adopted a more moderate position on the border.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"Now since late 2023 and into 2024, he shifted back to the right as he has his primary challenge from people like Brandon Herrera and Victor Avila. So this is a race where I think Gonzales runs the risk of being outflanked on his right by more conservative Republicans.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"He has a fundraising advantage. He has all the advantages of incumbency, but it’s possible he gets pushed to a runoff. And if it gets pushed to a runoff, then you get a more rarified group of primary voters who tend to be more conservative. And then Gonzales could be vulnerable.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas
"But right now, I think he’s probably shifted enough to the right where he’s put himself in a decent position to retain his seat, though not without some effort.",,www.keranews.org,https://www.keranews.org/politics/2024-02-20/2024-primary-elections-the-gop-and-democratic-races-to-watch-in-texas

"In the wake of a bitterly contested presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants to work to narrow the nation’s deep partisan divisions. It is likely to be a formidable task. Voters who supported Biden and Donald Trump say they not only differ over policies, but also have fundamental disagreements over core American values.",,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/
Yet there is a sentiment with which large shares of both Biden and Trump voters agree: a feeling that those who supported the other candidate have little or no understanding of people like them.,,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/

"If they had the chance, what would Biden and Trump voters want those on the opposing side to know about them to understand them better? Pew Research Center asked them – and they had a lot to say.

Many voters responded by asserting their own political values: About a quarter of Biden voters (26%) and 32% of Trump voters wanted their counterparts to know some of the key values that are important to them.,,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/
About one-in-ten Biden (12%) and Trump voters (11%) used the opportunity to tell those in the other camp not to ascribe negative stereotypes to them. These voters described in some detail how they feel mischaracterized and how the other side’s criticisms of them are flawed or inaccurate.,,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/
"Some voters struck themes of unity and common ground, including 13% of Biden voters and 5% of Trump supporters. They offered a perspective that Biden and Trump supporters are more alike than they are different or expressed a need for both groups to recognize each other as Americans.",,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/
"While some voters called for unity, larger shares (21% of Biden voters and 23% of Trump voters) criticized the opposing candidate or his supporters, often in harsh terms. This included explanations of why they are personally against Trump, Biden, or their opposing party’s behavior and policies.",,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/
"Two other themes worth noting were expressed by small shares of both Trump and Biden voters: 7% of Trump voters and 6% of Biden voters wrote about how they believe the other side is being misinformed. And about 3% of Biden and Trump voters took this opportunity to share personal, humanizing details about themselves.",,www.pewresearch.org,https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/12/17/voters-say-those-on-the-other-side-dont-get-them-heres-what-they-want-them-to-know/

"After record youth turnout in the 2020 elections, fewer Americans ages 18 to 29 plan to vote in 2024 in part due to widespread dissatisfaction with both President Joe Biden and his likely challenger former President Donald Trump, according to a new poll of young people by Harvard’s Institute of Politics.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"Compared to the same period in the 2020 election cycle, young Americans “definitely” planning to vote in the next presidential election dropped eight percentage points – from 57% to 49%. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated 54.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in 2020, which had the highest youth turnout overall of any election in the 21st century.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden

"“From a lack of trust in leaders on a variety of critical issues such as climate change, gun violence, and the war in the Middle East, to worries about the economy and AI, young people’s concerns come through loud and clear in our new poll,” the institute’s director Setti Warren said in a statement. “As the 2024 campaign season kicks into high gear, candidates up and down the ballot would be wise to embrace the opportunity to listen to – and re-engage – this generation.”",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"While young voters overwhelmingly preferred Biden over Trump, to the tune of 57% to 33%, neither candidate garnered more than 40% support when asked whether respondents trusted them more than their rival on issues ranging from democracy and “strengthening the working class,” to abortion, education and climate change.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"Both candidates have been courting the youth vote in their bids to win the White House for a second time. Biden won the record-setting youth vote by 24 percentage points in 2020, but a lack of progress on important issues to younger voters and the president’s response to mounting Palestinian civilian casualties in the Israel-Hamas war has left him vulnerable to more defectors and nonvoters.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"“President Biden has a choice: Declare a climate emergency and support a ceasefire in Gaza or lose the youth vote,” the Sunrise Movement posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. The influential climate change group is active in youth advocacy on the Democratic Party’s left and can be partially credited for popularizing the economic and climate policy platform known as the Green New Deal, adopted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and mined for parts by Biden.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"On each of the issues respondents were asked about, roughly one-third or more said they trusted neither candidate to handle them well. But young Americans trusted Biden and Trump the least to handle the Israel-Hamas war, with 44% saying they trusted neither man. More than half of independent voters lacked trust in both candidates to resolve the crisis.",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden
"“In a recent Quinnipiac poll, Americans voters overall sympathize with Israelis over Palestinians by a margin of 54-24. But among voters under 35, the numbers are nearly the reverse of that, with young voters more sympathetic to Palestinians by a 52-29 margin,” longtime polling analyst Nate Silver wrote in a recent newsletter. “Should Biden do more to cater — or if you prefer, to pander — to young voters? Actually, I think that’s not so clear. A more pro-Palestine stance probably would help Biden with young voters, for instance — but it’s unpopular with the rest of the electorate and might hurt Biden overall.”",,www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden

"Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off Saturday in South Carolina’s first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary, the first head-to-head matchup for the last two remaining major candidates since the New Hampshire primary a month ago.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"The contest takes place on Haley’s home turf. She was South Carolina's governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet. Haley has increasingly questioned Trump’s fitness for office, most recently criticizing his comments on Russia and NATO. It is a marked contrast from earlier in the campaign when she and other GOP hopefuls avoided criticizing Trump directly.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"The South Carolina primary is usually an indicator of which candidate will win the Republican presidential nomination. Since the modern version of the state’s primary began in 1980, all but one GOP primary winner has gone on to win the party’s nomination. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html

"South Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party’s primary. But voters may only participate in one party’s presidential primary, so people who voted in the Democratic primary on Feb. 3 may not vote in the Republican contest.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"Only about 4% of registered voters cast ballots in the Democratic contest, leaving the bulk of the electorate, including any Democrats and independents who favor Haley over Trump and didn’t vote in the earlier contest, eligible to weigh in on the Republican race.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
There are 50 delegates at stake and 29 will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Twenty-one delegates will be allocated according to the vote in each of the state’s seven congressional districts. The top vote-getter in each district will get three delegates from that district.,,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state’s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"Republican electoral politics have changed dramatically since the last time Haley and Trump each faced other Republican candidates in the Palmetto State. Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday’s primary.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley’s strongest showings and some of Trump’s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"Haley’s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
The results are broadly consistent with Haley’s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas.,,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
"The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html
There are about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. Voters do not register by party. Turnout in the 2016 Republican primary was about 25% of registered voters.

"The early voting period for the GOP primary is Feb. 12-22, excluding Feb. 18-19. In the 2016 Republican primary, when voters had to provide an excuse to cast an absentee ballot, about 8% of votes were cast before Election Day. In the 2022 midterm primaries, after the new law went into effect, pre-Election Day voting was at about 21%. About 36% of votes cast in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary were before Election Day.",,www.theolympian.com,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article285729231.html

"With Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, there has been speculation about who he will choose to be his running mate. Biden has pledged that his vice-presidential pick will be a woman stating, “There are a number of women who qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” After making this commitment in mid-March, journalists and political pundits wasted no time generating lists of qualified women who Joe Biden could potentially choose to be his running mate.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Despite pundits and party elites placing an outsized level of importance on the VP pick, rarely has a vice presidential running mate had more than a trivial impact on an election outcome. However, we arguably face the most important and consequential presidential election in modern history. In the context of global pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of Americans, devastated the economy, left millions of Americans unemployed, and pushed our healthcare system to the brink, Biden’s pick for VP choice may be perceived as far more meaningful than in past elections. Furthermore, given Biden’s age, there is a distinct possibility that whoever he chooses will be running a presidential race in 2024.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"So much of the perceived strategy of Biden’s choice hinges on what we think is more crucial to Biden’s success- “persuasion targets” verses “turnout targets.” Is the goal to increase turnout among younger voters and voters of color? Given the difference in turnout between 2012 and 2016 among black voters and the expanding Latino electorate in key states, this is a prudent goal. One of the most defining divides in the Democratic primary was the age difference in support for Biden, with voters under 45 more likely to have supported Bernie Sanders and voters over 45 more likely to support Biden. Furthermore, young voters (who are also more likely to be voters of color) simply turn out to vote at much lower levels. Polling shows that Biden has a huge lead over Trump with young voters, but this issue will inevitably be one of turnout.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"But is the more important goal to target persuadable voters? These voters would include white voters in the Midwest (many who voted for Trump in 2016), white suburbanites, moderate and conservative voters, as well as Independents. Despite changing demographics in the U.S., white men still make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018, 41% of white men voted for Democrats and undoubtedly helped contribute to their success. Polling shows that the split among white voters by college education is essentially the same as it was in 2016; whites without a college degree support Trump over Biden by about 30 points. However, the same polling also highlights the fact that Biden has not significantly increased support among whites with a college degree.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Speculation about the veepstakes is likely to pick up even more momentum as former Vice President Biden recently announced a panel of advisors to aid him in the selection of a running mate. Although there are many think pieces devoted to discussing who would be the smartest strategic pick for Biden, most fail to substantively discuss or provide data on what kind of voters each potential VP nominee might attract. Using relevant data from recent surveys, elections, and each potential VP’s past successes, I evaluate the types of voters each VP pick might be able to mobilize and how much of a boon that potential mobilization would be to the Biden campaign.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

1. Stacey Abrams,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Stacey Abrams rose to national prominence when she ran as the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor in 2018. While some of the other potential running mates under consideration have remained coy about any vice-presidential ambitions, Abrams has been open about her desire to serve as Biden’s VP. She has noted her history of fighting to protect the right to vote, her experience serving as her party’s minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, and has argued that it would be a mistake for Joe Biden not to pick a black woman like herself. Abrams told Jake Tapper on CNN, “As a young black woman, growing up in Mississippi, I learned that if you don't raise your hand, people won't see you, and they won't give you attention.”",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Given Abrams newcomer status to national politics, there are limited data points to draw from that speak to the types of voters she might bring into the fold. But her past performances offer some insights. Abrams lost her gubernatorial bid to then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp by a thin margin. Kemp was overseeing the election that he competed in and enforced some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country, resulting in allegations of voter suppression. Despite this, more black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Latino voters turned out in Georgia’s 2018 midterm election than in the 2016 presidential election. Georgia was the only state where midterm turnout was greater than presidential turnout among voters of color. This speaks to Abrams’ ability to mobilize voters of color who might otherwise stay home on Election Day. Additionally, Abrams achieved this without losing the support for white voters. She won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama. In the Data for Progress poll, 17% of black voters chose Abrams as their preferred VP nominee (second only to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren at 22%). Furthermore, a plurality (21%) of black voters felt that Abrams would be the most effective in implementing policies as VP.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

2.  Senator Tammy Baldwin,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has largely flown under the radar in the veepstakes discussion and has been left out of most national polling. Wisconsin is emerging as one of the most crucial (if not the most crucial) battleground state in the 2020 election. Baldwin has been in the Senate since 2013 and is the first openly LGBT member of the Senate. Although she lacks name recognition nationally, Senator Baldwin won her 2018 race by double digits. This is no small feat in a purple state like Wisconsin where Democrat Tony Evers beat Scott Walker in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a razor thin margin (slightly over 1%). In fact, about 8% of voters split their ticket and supported both Walker and Baldwin. Exit polls show that 10% of Republicans and 59% of Independents or non-affiliated voters voted for Baldwin. This fact speaks to Baldwin’s ability to put together a coalition that includes both progressives, Independents, and even some Trump supports. Another potential strength is her progressive bona fides. She is one of the most liberal members of the U.S. Senate. This could mobilize progressives who feel lukewarm about Biden.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

3. Senator Tammy Duckworth,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth is another woman on this list who has made history. She won her 2016 election and became the second Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, the first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress, and the first Senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is a combat veteran and was the first female double amputee from the Iraq War (her Black Hawk helicopter was shot down by Iraqi insurgents). She served in the house for four years before running for the Senate. Although Duckworth has not been included in many national polls, YouGov polling indicates that she is slightly more popular among millennials and men. In her 2016 Senate victory, she won only 17 out of Illinois’ 102 counties. Duckworth won by huge margins in terms of total votes in urban counties which secured her victory. According to CNN exit polls from 2016, she did particularly well among non-white voters, and notably, voters without a college degree as well as moderates and Independents.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Senator Duckworth previously served as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and was appointed by President Barack Obama to be the Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. She has a long history of advocating for vets. Although the relationship between electoral victory and candidate military experience is nuanced, researchers have found that people use candidates’ military service to make inferences about defense competence and interventionism that can lead to higher support among some groups of voters. Other work has found that voters overwhelming perceive candidates with military experience to be more competent in handling national security and defense issues. It’s difficult to extrapolate what this might mean in terms of any potential benefit to the Biden campaign. However, Duckworth’s distinct lived experience as a veteran, Asian-American woman, a person with a physical disability, and a new mother, might appeal to voters seeking representation and recognition in the next administration.

4. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Another governor that has garnered attention as a potential veep choice is New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Lujan Grisham became the first Latina Democratic woman governor in 2019, after serving three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Despite holding these posts, Lujan Grisham’s national profile remains relatively low, reducing the amount of data from which to draw in predicting her influence on a presidential ticket. Elected from both a majority-Latino district and state and as the former head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Lujan Grisham would bring strong ties to the Latino community. This might help a Biden presidential ticket with mobilizing Latino voters. In the presidential primary, Sanders did far better with Latino voters than Biden. A recent survey from Latino Decisions shows support for Biden at 59% among Latinos, compared to just two months ago when it was at 67%. According to New York Times, Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc this fall. Latino support in key swing states like Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania could be decisive for Biden.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"It’s also worth noting, given the current public health crisis, that Governor Lujan Grisham began her career as a health commissioner in Bernalillo County and ultimately was appointed as New Mexico’s Secretary of Health. Lujan Grisham has also been garnering high approval ratings (62%) for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

5. Senator Kamala Harris,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Out of all the potential VP nominees, the one that has perhaps been cited the most as a likely pick is Senator Kamala Harris. In a March 2020 YouGov poll, 18% of Democratic primary voters selected Kamala Harris as their preferred choice for Biden’s running mate (second only to Warren). In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Harris was in the middle of pack with 10% of respondents choosing her as their preferred VP running mate. Her support, also in the Harvard poll, remains relatively stable across age groups, although older voters preferred her slightly more than younger voters. There was also a notable gap in support for Harris across racial lines with 16% of black voters selecting her verses 9% of white voters. However, it’s unclear how much of a benefit this is to the Biden coalition given his already deeply entrenched support in the black community. It’s also not a given that Kamala Harris, a black woman, would mobilize black voters. During the presidential race, Harris, as well as the only other black candidate in the race, Cory Booker, were unable to make inroads in South Carolina, a state where African Americans are about a third of the population and an even larger proportion of Democratic voters. One promising data point for Harris is that, in the March YouGov poll, she garnered the highest support among Hispanic voters (26%) in VP selection. The Latino vote will be an essential voting bloc in 2020.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Based on these data points, it’s clear that while Democratic primary voters have generally warm feelings towards Kamala Harris, but her support among other groups suggests that she might have trouble generating enthusiasm outside of the existing Biden coalition.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

6. Senator Amy Klobuchar,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Another potential VP pick is Senator Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar has 63% favorability among Democratic primary voters according to the latest YouGov poll. The moderate Minnesota senator displays major strength among older voters, particularly those 65 and older. In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Klobuchar was the preferred VP choice for 19% of respondents 65 and older (the most popular choice among that age group) and 12% of voters 50-64 compared to only 3% of voters 18-34 and 5% of voters 35-49. These numbers indicate that Senator Klobuchar will better mobilize older voters. In the YouGov poll, she is the second highest in support from Democratic primary voters age 65+. However, it’s important to note that generally, these voters are already mobilized. We know that older people go to the polls at significantly larger numbers than younger people. According to CNN exit polls during the midterm election, 56% of voters were over age 50 and 26% were 65 or over. By comparison, only 13% of voters were under the age of 30 and this was considered a high turnout for young voters.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Klobuchar clearly appeals to older voters but it’s unclear that would be a significant benefit to the Biden coalition. It is worth noting that in the Harvard poll, Klobuchar was tied with Sanders as the preferred candidate of voters who voted for Trump in 2016, suggesting she could pick off some Trump voters. During the presidential primary, where Klobuchar hit a stumbling block was with voters of color. She out-performed expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire (overwhelmingly white states), but failed to mobilize voters of color, particularly black voters, in Nevada and South Carolina, effectively ending her presidential bid.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

7. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made history when she became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. She served as the Attorney General of Nevada from 2007 to 2015 but has not yet achieved much of a national profile. Cortez Masto was included on the most recent Data for Progress poll where she garnered only 1% of support from Democratic voters, most likely a result of her low name ID. As one of the very few Latina women in Congress and as a statewide representative of a state where Latinos are 29% of the population, Cortez Masto has the potential to and experience in mobilizing Latino voters. Her knowledge of and popularity in a swing state like Nevada is also worth weighing in considering her benefit to a presidential ticket.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

8. Senator Elizabeth Warren,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"It was only a month and a half ago that Senator Elizabeth Warren, once a front-runner, dropped out of the presidential race. A little over a week ago she endorsed Joe Biden and when asked by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC how she would respond if Biden asked her to serve as vice president, Warren responded “Yes.”",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Warren has been the leading woman candidate among Democrats in two recent polls. In an April 2020 Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, 13% of all respondents chose Warren as their preferred VP pick.[1] This is second only to the 20% of respondents who chose Senator Bernie Sanders. When Data for Progress listed only women contenders in another April 2020 survey, 31% of Democratic respondents chose Warren, with Senator Kamala Harris coming in second with 18% of support. Notably, 42% of Democrats identified Warren as the potential vice presidential candidate most ready to be president. In a recent YouGov poll, Elizabeth Warren had the highest favorability (77%) among Democratic primary voters. Other YouGov polling suggests similarly positive feelings for Warren. A plurality of Democratic primary voters in a March 2020 poll said that Biden should select Warren as his VP.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"These data points highlight that the Democratic base generally has warm feelings towards Warren. However, conventional wisdom during and after her presidential bid was that the Massachusetts senator does better with women, more educated voters, and more liberal voters. The extant data seems to bear this out. Out of the five women candidates who were included as response options in the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the gender gap in support was the largest for Elizabeth Warren with 15% of women selecting Warren as their preferred pick compared to 11% of men in the survey. Similarly, YouGov polling from March indicates that among Democratic primary voters, 29% of women and 25% of men think that Elizabeth Warren should be selected as the nominee for vice-president. According to NBC exit polls, this gender gap was consistent in almost every presidential primary contest as well. In the presidential primary, Warren lost in her home state and struggled to win support among white men without college degrees (although Warren did do better with college-educated white men than with working class white women underscoring the complicated gender dynamics at play). Another weak spot for Warren is with Independent voters. Exit polls from her 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate showed that her that her opponent, Scott Brown, did better with Independent voters, particularly men. This weak spot played out in the 2020 presidential primary in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and several other Super Tuesday states.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

9. Governor Gretchen Whitmer,,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as another potential running mate for Joe Biden, particularly as she rose to national consciousness because of her response to the Covid-19 pandemic and her outspoken criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis. Whitmer has a long and successful electoral history, having served three terms in the Michigan House of Representatives and two terms in the Michigan Senate before her gubernatorial run in 2018. Given Michigan’s status as a crucial battleground state and the fact that Trump won Michigan in 2016 by the narrowest margin in the history of the state, it makes sense that Governor Whitmer is on the short list.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Whitmer is rated favorably by 47% of Democratic primary voters, although it’s important to note that over 40% were unfamiliar with her. She is also popular in her state. Despite criticism from some Republicans over her aggressive response to Covid-19 and protests over the stay-at-home orders, Whitmer’s approval rating is 60% in Michigan (15 points higher than Trump’s approval rating in the state). With limited data, it’s difficult to discern what types of voters might be energized by Whitmer as a VP pick. In the Data for Progress poll, only 3% of Democratic voters chose Whitmer as their VP choice, which is likely a product of low name ID. However, her win in 2018 demonstrated her ability to put together a diverse coalition of black voters, suburban women, blue collar workers, and even voters in conservative parts of the state.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

"When considering the potential VP nominees (although this list is not exhaustive), the various data points we can draw from, the voter bases that Biden needs to reach, the idiosyncrasies of this particular election environment, and the dubiousness of the importance of the VP pick, it’s difficult to extract any conclusions about who is the best strategic choice for Joe Biden. What does seem instinctively true is the heightened importance of this choice in this particular moment and the long list of highly qualified women who would bring myriad benefits to the presidential ticket.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize
"Furthermore, given the recent allegations of sexual assault against Joe Biden, all of the women on this list will have to thread the needle between supporting Biden without being perceived as being dismissive of the allegations. As Rebecca Traister outlined in her article in The Cut, any woman who accepts Biden’s invitation to be his running mate will become ensnared in this controversy.",,cawp.rutgers.edu,https://cawp.rutgers.edu/blog/what-voters-could-bidens-vp-pick-mobilize

"“They deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections.

"The Trump campaign sought to undercut Haley’s message by releasing a memo hours before Haley’s speech, arguing their calculations show Trump will earn the number of delegates needed to become the Republican nominee by March 19 at the latest and that Haley’s campaign was “out of gas.”",,whdh.com,https://whdh.com/news/ahead-of-south-carolina-primary-nikki-haley-vows-to-stay-in-the-race-until-the-last-person-votes/

Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race:,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out. But she told The Associated Press that she's not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday.

"""Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn't Russia. We don't want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,"" Haley said. ""What is the rush?

The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events.,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
Just don't ask Haley which primary state she's going to win.,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
It's a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren't willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can't. That's because polls suggest she's a major underdog in virtually every state – even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor – given Trump's grip on the Republican Party.,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party's most energized partisans – not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview.,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"""Instead of asking me what states I'm gonna win, why don't we ask how he's gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?"" she said.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"Still, Haley's team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump – especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allow a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"By the way, one of them is South Carolina, which allows voters to participate in whichever presidential primary they want – as long as they only vote once.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
"Stop us if you've heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser?",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422

"Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he's betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump's legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422
There's also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren't ready to surrender to Trump's MAGA politics even if the math is on his side.,,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422

"Haley's campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone – her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas.",,www.wbaltv.com,https://www.wbaltv.com/article/nikki-haley-presidential-race-trump-race-update/46870422

"Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates.

"The contest takes place on Haley’s home turf. She was South Carolina's governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base.",,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html
"Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet.

"The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state’s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics.",,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html

"Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election.",,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html
"Haley’s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump.",,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html
The results are broadly consistent with Haley’s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas.,,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html
"These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties.",,www.charlotteobserver.com,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/south-carolina/article285729231.html
"The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.

"The remarks underscored the delicate politics the two Republican senators must navigate to turn out a base convinced the presidential election was stolen.

The establishment candidate is once again cruising to the Democratic nomination — which raises a familiar question about Bernie Sanders' insurgents,,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"One month out from the Iowa caucuses, the race for the Democratic nomination looks remarkably stable. Joe Biden is solidly in the lead, Bernie Sanders is roughly nine points behind him, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have faded, and Michael Bloomberg is blowing through wads of cash in order to stay inches ahead of Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"The dynamics of the race have been consistent at the top for more than a year now. Unless something changes soon, Biden is going to prevail. Which means that Sanders will not. And that could be a major problem for the party.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
Will Sanders supporters be willing (for the second time in as many presidential election cycles) to hold their noses and turn out to vote in November for a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party establishment when the socialist to whom they're so passionately devoted falls short of victory? Or will they be inclined (in much greater numbers than they did in 2016) to stay home or support someone's third-party bid from the left in a deliberate attempt to sink a party for which they have burning contempt? Those questions are going to become increasingly important as events unfold over the next few months.,,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins

"Of course, the opposite could also become a problem. If Biden sinks and Sanders somehow manages to rise above 20 percent in the polls (he hasn't been higher than that since last April) and ultimately win the nomination, the more moderate voters backing Biden will need to decide if they can stomach casting a ballot for the most left-wing candidate ever to become a major party nominee.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"But there is one very important difference between Biden and Sanders voters. The former are supporting the former vice president primarily because they think he is well-poised to win in a general-election contest against Trump. There's very little sign of fervent devotion to Biden as a person or a candidate. This indicates pragmatic flexibility that may be compatible with rallying behind another nominee, even if he's a socialist promising $97 trillion in new government spending.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"The same cannot be said for Sanders supporters, who are uncompromisingly devoted to the Vermont senator and passionately committed to undertaking what he breathlessly describes as a “political revolution.” The Atlantic's Derek Thompson is right to suggest that these millennial (and younger) voters effectively constitute a third, firmly left-wing party in American politics. This party is happy to turn out for the Democrats so long as Sanders is its nominee. But if it's bumbling, stumbling Biden — a man who served for eight years as a right-hand man to a lukewarm, moderate president after decades of representing a state (Delaware) dominated by credit card companies — well, then all bets are off. (Even if you believe polls that show a decent number of Bernie voters would shift to Biden as their second choice, this would still leave an awful lot of unhappy and homeless Sanders supporters around to stir up trouble.)",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"It would be one thing if 2016 had never happened. But it did, and many of Bernie's supporters feel like they got burned badly by the Democratic establishment not once but twice four years ago. First, their hopes were raised by Sanders' surprising success across the country and then dashed by his inability to overcome Hillary Clinton's strong institutional support. Then they settled for Clinton as a consolation prize in order to defeat Donald Trump in the general election only to have her lose to him. As far as they're concerned, they've been fooled two times already.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"It's passion that explains Sanders' incredible success at fundraising — with $34.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, a number that is likely to dwarf everyone else's in the race. It's even more impressive when we factor in the Sanders campaign's emphasis on collecting small donations. That shows a lot of devotion by a lot of people.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"So far there's no sign that it's enough people to win the race for the nomination. But it would be more than enough to torpedo Democrats' chances of taking down Trump in November. Will Sanders (an independent who only calls himself a Democrat when he's running for president) urge his supporters once again to back the Democratic nominee, even if it's Biden? And even if he does, will those supporters go along with such an unrevolutionary act of sail-trimming?",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"That would be the real test of whether Sanders is leading a cult of his own personality or a genuine, ideologically galvanized movement that will outlast his leadership and continue to influence the shape of American politics going forward.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"A movement firmly committed to bringing about the scale of changes Sanders has been advocating wouldn't hesitate to “heighten the contradictions” — that is, allow things to get worse in the short term (by acting in a way that helps Trump to win a second term) in the hope that better long-term prospects for progress (namely, a big shift to the left in the electorate) would emerge from the mess. If nothing else, a second loss to Trump would ensure the overthrow of the establishment that has led the Democratic Party since 1992, thereby opening up the prospect of its takeover by left-wing populists by 2024.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins
"As I've pointed out before, the Democratic electoral coalition is extremely broad, and perhaps too broad for its own good. A party that's big enough to include everyone from socialist Bernie Sanders to liberal Republican Michael Bloomberg is a party that will struggle to find a single standard-bearer who can unite its disparate factions. It might even be a party poised to shatter into its constituent parts.",,theweek.com,https://theweek.com/articles/887051/bernie-voters-vote-biden-when-wins

Dear Mr. President.,,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"I am writing you this letter in concern for the economy, my family, and my home. I am a 35 year old mother of 1 little boy who is 5. I have a concern that I need you to hear from an average family trying to make it through these hard times. I do not expect that anything will be done, but I do want you to hear how we are struggling.",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"I was laid off in June from a job that I was at for 8 years making a pretty substantial salary. My husband, who was an electrician, has been laid off since September of 2008. He was called back to work in July 2009 but only worked for about 2 months before his company laid him off again and he has been out of work ever since. I was only able to land myself a temporary job that my new boss is struggling to make permanent. We do not have any insurance for our son and we are living off of my salary which is about 10K less a year and unemployment. We struggle living week to week to pay our mortgage- which was underwritten to a smaller amount so that we do not have to let our house go into foreclosure. I want you to have a good idea of the history of events that have occurred with our bank and credit.",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"We refinanced our mortgage in 2006 thinking we could get a leg up on some of our credit card bills and also invest more money into our home. When we refinanced with our bank they did not set up an escrow account - which they did not tell us. When we figured it out - they basically told us it was too late. So that said, we have been struggling to pay our taxes but we have taken out a 401K my husband had and we paid our taxes through July of last year. We have had some hard times through our marriage which ended up costing us more in credit card debt. We have now reconciled and are also struggling to pay that as well. We have received letters through the mail that say that this is part of your plan to help America reduce their debt so we signed a contract with a company that pay every month which should in the end reduce the overall payment of our credit cards for a settlement. Since we have done that we have received numerous creditor calls and letters, and judgments against us- which has completely ruined our credit overall so far. We have no future, only weekly income!",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"So now, it's tax time. Since we were both laid off for a good amount of time in 2009 and that my husband was laid off for the majority of 2009 we now owe in taxes- on top of the taxes that we already owe. I ask you - how we are supposed to pay that? How do you expect anyone that has been laid off to pay any of their taxes when there are no jobs to help alleviate that? Why do you offer to take taxes out when someone applies for unemployment? Being used to a cost of living expense and having to even reduce that to an unemployment paycheck you want to receive as much money as you are eligible for to make up for the money you are used to receiving. Just put yourself in our shoes?",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"Everyone I know who voted for you is now turning the other direction, but I have faith in you and that you will do what you can to turn this around, in the meantime I am struggling with the fact that we may need to just walk away from our home to alleviate the stress of paying for this home and on top of that I am trying to go back to school online to better myself and hopefully in the long run better my family.",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home
"My son is the one who is receiving the short end of the stick here as it has been stressful on him as well. We end up taking it out on him or he just wants to make things better for us by spending his time making money out of paper and giving it to us. Thinking it will help.... HE's FIVE years old!!! I have seen you in office for over a year now and I want to know what you can do to help us- the average family just trying to get back on our feet, live our lives like Americans should and not have to feel like we are constantly struggling. You say you read these - at least 10 a day- and I am sure there are other families struggling just the same if not worse, but how are you going to help us??? Wall street executives walk away with high pay outs on their investments or receive bonus checks for the work they have performed, most of them are snyde corporate executives who have helped put the economy where it is at today.... but what about the people who are doing the work for them?? ? We end up getting the struggle. We are the ones who will end up homeless and we are the ones who you talk about when you say AMERICA is struggling and we have not seen any relief except that you can continue to collect for another 13 weeks only to pay for it in the end... with the taxes you require us to pay back... WHY would you make those who are unemployed because of this melt down have to pay back? We did not ask for this in the first place. I wonder where we can find the money to give millions away in lotto but no money for the economy?? This is just something I do not get. I'm an upset American who is losing faith in you... I do not want to lose that faith.. When I voted for you, I really was inspired that you will make the changes to help us- the average middle class- but all I see is that upper class walking away feeling ok... while we continue to struggle. It's not fair... The honest middle class are sitting back struggling... it's just not fair... We never asked for this!! I don't expect anything from this letter... just put yourself in my shoes... Every day I'm watching my family fall apart and also worried about potentially losing my home... all because we of what we know... Yes, the economy is bad... yea yea yea... This is heartbreaking!!!",,obamawhitehouse.archives.gov,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/letter/i-am-writing-you-letter-concern-economy-my-family-and-my-home

"For months now, I’ve been deflecting questions about polling of the 2024 general election – which increasingly looks to be a rerun of 2020’s match-up of Trump v. Biden: Don’t ask election analysts who will win … ask an economist or a foreign policy expert. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"For former President Donald Trump, polling right now looks pretty good. So good, in fact, that it’s blunted what looked to be a core argument of Trump’s Republican challengers – ""I’ll pursue Trump’s policies – and I’ll win the election."" (""Unlike him"" – an unspoken tagline that’s proving ineffective given recent polls.) ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls

TRUMP HOLDS LARGE LEAD OVER HALEY 4 DAYS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
They almost sound like they’ve convinced themselves. (FYI: They haven’t.) ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are likely caught in an unusual battle of incumbents. (Getty Images),,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
Polls this year are likely to be hard to read and interpret.  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
That’s particularly true because – as we wrote earlier – there appear to be essentially two incumbents running – each with their records and personalities that the public can judge. ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"The likely GOP candidate is one of the most polarizing figures in modern political history. Whatever folks – supporters and opponents alike – think of Trump today, in December 2023, is unlikely to change between now and November. The only way to paint Trump is to use primary colors.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"President Joe Biden, by contrast, is one of the least colorful national political figures in recent memory, a view completely consistent with his favorite ice cream flavor – vanilla. After he won the South Carolina primary in 2020, Democrats didn’t so much rally to his side as they got in line and breathed a collective sigh of, ""Oh, well, OK, Biden’s fine.""  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"This year, that gets complicated by the regular occurrence of apparent stumbles in memory or leaving the stage – and, last week, the special counsel’s assessment that Biden would come off as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."" ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Especially in the polarized political environment of 2024, at best, it makes it harder for potential Democrat voters to decide to vote for Biden – and makes it easier for reluctant GOP voters to decide that they’d prefer to get back to Trump. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
The two contrasting metaphors were borne out in recent polling.  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"While Trump basically holds steady in most polls – in the high 40s, Biden bounces around from poll to poll – more often behind Trump – but sometimes ahead. In all cases, analysts pore over the data looking for an explanation for why the race has changed. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls

(Fox News),,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Unlike Trump – whose Republican base has solidified in recent months – Democrats have been hesitant to evince support for their leader – indeed, the biggest variable of Biden’s standing, tends to be young voters or minority voters.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"They remain unenthusiastic – even skeptical – of Biden. One sees that, most clearly, in the most recent Fox polls (Michigan and North Carolina). In each, Trump gets the same percentage vote he got in 2020. Trump’s vote is baked in, but Biden’s vote is in question. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
What are the implications for November? ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Rather than reading polls and looking at the difference between the two – the way the headlines like to shout [Trump leads Biden by 2, no, Biden leads Trump by 1.] – one should focus on each candidate’s number – and each one’s standing with their traditional supporters. Trump is almost always hovering around 47%.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"For Trump – that means looking at both the level of his support – and the enthusiasm of his supporters. In the wake of four indictments, and cases arguing that he should be kept off the ballot in some states, we’ve seen his support strengthen – both the enthusiasm of solid supporters, and apparent growth among voters who liked him and seemed to be considering other candidates.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"The enthusiasm that enabled Trump to outperform polling expectations in both 2016 and 2020 seems to still be there among Republicans. It’s why his number in general election polling still hovers between 45 and 50. To the extent that the election is a referendum on Trump, the vast bulk of his 2016 and 2020 supporters thinks things were just better when he was president. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
The political shape of the electorate is fairly clear – and it’s not moving. About 47% (almost half) of the country supports Trump – and that number doesn’t move. The remaining roughly 53% (a bit more than half) are not supporting him – and there are few if any indications that they could move in his direction.  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Which – importantly – does not mean that they’re ready to support Biden. Indeed, all polls suggest many are very much not ready to vote for Biden. And, voting in America is never an either/or option: Voters can vote for one of the two major party candidates, they can vote for a third-party nominee (there will be a bunch this November), or they can just stay home.

"But Biden is a very different political character from Trump. While Trump voters may think he’s corrupt or unconstitutionally elected – the remaining 53% range from those who are disappointed by inflation, opposed to his policies or somewhat lukewarm to his administration’s accomplishments. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
And that’s underscored by attitudes about his age and his weak on-camera appearances.  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"The age issue gets amplified essentially every time one sees him walk to the podium or speak in a way that makes it appear he’s searching for a word. And it was especially newsworthy when Special Counsel Robert Hur explained that at a potential trial, Biden would appear to the jury as a ""sympathetic, elderly man with a poor memory.""  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Not exactly the kind of person one would want on a debate stage, let alone facing off against President Xi Jinping of China, or President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Questions about his age make it harder – even for solid Democrats – to articulate a desire to vote for Biden. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"But I’d argue that Biden’s standing – with the 53% of American electorate who might vote for him – depends less on what potential Biden voters think about him personally today (what shows up in polls), and much more sensitive to what they think about the situation facing the U.S. – and his age – looks like in October. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"More than many presidents, Biden’s fingerprints are all over five domestic and global issues: (The issue of border security, Biden’s embrace of Ukraine, his support of Israel, his legislative programs to compete with China (the CHIPs act), and his efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy. Voters’ views of Biden will hinge very much on the outcome of those actions. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"I’m neither an economist nor an international relations expert – but what we’ve seen politically bears that out. The border security issue is turning into a political tug of war over the failure of a bipartisan compromise. Ukraine looks at best a stalemate. The Israel-Hamas war is, right now, ugly. And while inflation seems to be subsiding and the economy doesn’t look headed to a recession, prices, especially grocery prices, are still higher than they were when he took office. And China … well … who knows? ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"So, don’t look at the polling, look at a calendar – and consider whether any – or all – of the above are likely to change.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Which – importantly – does not mean that they’re ready to support Biden. Indeed, all polls suggest many are very much not ready to vote for Biden.

The Gaza war will look very different in six months. The Biden team is mounting a full-court press to get to some kind of resolution. He may show signs of progress – or further signs of ugliness. ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"The Ukrainians are currently struggling. In six months, folks who say we’re wasting our money will find their argument more salient – or less – if things go differently. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Some people say that foreign policy issues rarely affect U.S. elections. True, but note that Biden’s job approval numbers – which started high, actually only turned negative in the wake of the disastrous pullout from Afghanistan. They went south because he lost an aura of competence – and they will either turn around – or firm negative depending on the impact of other foreign events.  ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"My own view is simple. Yes, the public doesn’t vote based on a president’s foreign policies – but high-profile actions on the world stage do affect whether they think the president is essentially competent – or incompetent. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Biden's poor handling of the Afghanistan pullout set in motion other criticisms of his leadership.

"And then there’s the apparent failure of the border bill, which the Biden people are trying to blame on Trump, while the Republicans say it wasn’t good enough. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"Finally, there’s the economy – typically the most important factor in U.S. elections. There’s been some good economic news – but so far, we’ve seen very little impact on Biden’s anemic polling. That may change – if the economic news continues to be positive, especially on inflation. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
"The bottom line for Biden, he should worry less about his poll numbers than making sure the actual results he delivers are welcomed by the electorate. ",,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
That’s especially true given his age. Biden is not the first incumbent to face serious questions about his age and failing memory. Ronald Reagan stumbled in his first 1984 debate when he looked almost to be suffering from aphasia (the inability to find a word).  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
It led to a two-week firestorm about Reagan’s age. The popular wisdom is that he defused it with a timely joke in the second debate.  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls
Was it the joke or was it the reality that voters felt the Reagan administration had achieved real results in the economy and with the U.S. standing in the world?  ,,www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/understanding-election-2024-more-than-just-reading-polls

"Some folks believe Biden should make himself more ""available"" for unscripted TV viewers. Given every interview and speech I’ve seen, that’s a recipe for further challenges.

Ducklo criticized media outlets for time spent discussing the 81-year-old president’s age and mental capacity, an issue that was raised anew when Biden addressed the Hur report with reporters. Americans deserve a press corps that covers Trump “with the seriousness and ferocity this moment requires,” said Ducklo, who resigned from the White House in 2021 for threatening a reporter.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"To be fair, Trump’s comments at a rally Friday night likely came past the deadlines of some sections where Biden stories appeared that weekend.

"A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, noted in an interview with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism that Biden’s team had been “extremely upset” about its coverage lately. “We’re not anyone’s opposition,” he said, “and we’re not anyone’s lapdog.”",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
The criticism comes amid the backdrop of unhappiness among some journalists about how much Biden is made available for questions — an issue that surfaced again when Biden turned down an opportunity to appear before tens of millions of Americans in an interview during the Super Bowl pregame show.,,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"The 33 news conferences Biden has given during the first three years of his presidency is lower than any other American president in that time span since Ronald Reagan, said Martha Kumar, a Towson University professor emeritus and expert on presidents and the press. Similarly, the 86 interviews Biden has given is lower than any president since she began studying records with Reagan. By comparison, Barack Obama gave 422 interviews during his first three years.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"Instead, Biden prefers more informal appearances where reporters ask a few questions, with comparatively little opportunity for follow-up, she said: The 535 such sessions that Biden conducted was second only to Trump’s 572.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"One example followed Biden’s remarks Friday after the death of Russian dissident Aleksey Navalny. Another was Biden’s early evening availability following the release of Hur’s report, a chaotic scene where reporters tried to outshout one another. The president’s performance, and remarks about his forgetfulness that were made in Hur’s report, led to more questions about the impact of age on his ability.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"“It did not serve him well,” Kumar said. Some on Biden’s team, meanwhile, believe the president showed a combativeness in the face of criticism that Americans will appreciate.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/
"Sesno said he can understand the Biden team’s worry that the president’s fitness for the job becomes a story they lose control of, much like former President Gerald Ford’s stumbles led to the perception that he was a bumbler. Nikki Usher, a media professor at the University of San Diego, said she was surprised that Biden’s team hadn’t become more aggressive earlier.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/

"The Biden pushback seems mild in comparison to Trump’s epic badmouthing of news organizations like CNN and The New York Times. Republican voters, in general, are much more apt to respond to efforts that make journalists the villain. Democrats, meanwhile, tend to have a greater appreciation for the press’ role in a democracy, Usher says, so the Biden team has to be more careful with attacks.",,www.kxan.com,https://www.kxan.com/news/political-news/ap-its-an-election-year-and-bidens-team-is-signaling-a-more-aggressive-posture-toward-the-press/

"Absolutely. Biden was voted into office because he was able to convince struggling americans that he would instill change for the better, (wiping student debt, handing out more stimulus checks, acknowledging LGBTQRSTUVXYZ Community) and people believed him. Mostly people voted for him because they didn't like President Trump though. They couldn't comprehend or agree with the way he spoke and tweeted.

"In 2016, seven electors declined to vote for the candidate they were pledged to. That was the highest number of “faithless electors” ever, with the exception of the election of 1872. That year sixty-three electors broke their pledge. They had a good reason to do so, however. They were pledged to Democratic candidate Horace Greeley—he of “Go West” fame. Greeley died three weeks after losing to Ulysses S. Grant and before the Electoral College met. His pledged electors were understandably reluctant to vote for a dead man. Three electors, however, did cast their votes for Greeley.",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
,,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers

"Biden won 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the votes cast. He is the first U.S. presidential candidate to have won more than 80 million votes. Trump won 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. That’s more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won, with the exception of Biden. (Third-party candidates picked up 1.8 percent of the votes cast.)",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
"More than 159 million Americans voted in 2020: 159,633,396 to be exact. That’s the largest total voter turnout in U.S. history and the first time more than 140 million people voted. Voter turnout in 2020 was the highest in 120 years when measured as a percentage of the voting-eligible population: 66.7 percent. You have to go back all the way to 1900 to find a higher percentage turnout (73.7 percent). The election of 1876 holds the record for highest turnout: 82.6 percent.

A Close Election or Not?  ,,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
"So did Biden win comfortably? Yes, if you go by the popular vote. In the past six presidential elections, only Barack Obama in 2008 won by a larger total vote margin than the 7,060,140-vote margin that Biden piled up. Likewise, Biden’s 4.5 percentage point lead is the largest win in the past six elections other than Obama’s seven-point win in 2008.",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
"But as Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden, Grover Cleveland, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton can all attest, winning the popular vote doesn’t necessarily mean winning the presidency. When you look at the smallest popular vote shift needed to give Trump a victory, the 2020 election was close. Indeed, it was even closer than 2016. If Trump picked up the right mix of 42,921 votes in Arizona (10,457), Georgia (11,779), and Wisconsin (20,682), the Electoral College would have been tied at 269 all. The House would have then decided the election. Republicans will hold the majority of state delegations in the new Congress, and they undoubtedly would have chosen Trump. If Trump had also picked up the one electoral vote in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, which he lost to Biden by 22,091 votes, he would have won the Electoral College outright. Back in 2016, Clinton needed to pick up the right mix of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College.",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers

"The 117th Congress will have a record total 141 women, or 26.4 percent of its membership, when it convenes on January 3. (Even so, women’s representation in Congress will lag behind that in the national legislatures of many other democratic countries.) Those numbers don’t include Senator Kamala Harris, who will be resigning her seat, or non-voting delegates in the House. These numbers could change slightly or remain the same, depending on whether Kelly Loeffler wins the January 5 run-off for her Georgia Senate seat and who is appointed to fill Vice-President-Elect Harris’s Senate seat. Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge is set to resign her seat so she can become secretary of Housing and Urban Development.",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
"Women won’t, however, be equally distributed between the two parties. Democrats will have 105 women members of Congress, which is one less than in the 116th Congress. Republicans will have thirty-six women lawmakers, or fourteen more than in the 116th Congress. That breaks the record the GOP set back in 2006. The House will have 117 women lawmakers, with eighty-nine Democrats and twenty-eight Republicans. Nine out of the thirteen House seats Republicans flipped from blue to red were won by women. Meanwhile, there will be twenty-four women senators, sixteen of whom are Democrats and eight of whom are Republicans. Again, how Loeffler fares on January 5 and who replaces Harris and Fudge could change these numbers.",,www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers
"A record fifty-one women of color will serve in the 117th Congress. The previous record was forty-eight, set by the 116th Congress. Republicans broke their record for most women of color in Congress (five). The previous GOP record was three, set in 2014. Forty-six women of color will represent Democrats (not including Kamala Harris), down from the record forty-seven from the last Congress. Cori Bush (D-MO) became the first Black congresswoman elected in Missouri and Marilyn Strickland (D-WA) the first in the state of Washington. Strickland also joins Young Kim (R-CA) and Michelle Steel (R-CA) to become the first Korean American women in Congress. Wyoming elected its first female Senator: Republican Cynthia Lummis.

The Senate will have two Black members after Harris resigns, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina. That number could go higher depending on whether Raphael Warnock wins his race in Georgia and on who is chosen to succeed Harris as California’s junior senator.
