      "{'authors': '', 'date': '2001-10-28 21:11:44', 'title': 'Pierre Trudeau', 'content': 'Prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984\\nJoseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau ( TROO-doh, troo-DOH, French: [pjɛʁ tʁydo]; October 18, 1919 – September 28, 2000) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the 15th prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1984. Between his non-consecutive terms as prime minister, he served as the leader of the Opposition from 1979 to 1980.\\nTrudeau was born and raised in Outremont, Quebec, a Montreal suburb, and studied politics and law. In the 1950s, he rose to prominence as a labour activist in Quebec politics by opposing the conservative Union Nationale government. Trudeau was then an associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal. He was originally part of the social democratic New Democratic Party, though felt they could not achieve power, and instead joined the Liberal Party in 1965. That year, he was elected to the House of Commons, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson\\'s parliamentary secretary. In 1967, he was appointed as minister of justice and attorney general. As minister, Trudeau created more flexible divorce laws, decriminalized homosexuality, and legalized abortion. Trudeau\\'s outgoing personality and charismatic nature caused a media sensation, inspiring \"Trudeaumania\", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he succeeded Pearson and became prime minister of Canada.\\nFrom the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Trudeau\\'s personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as prime minister, he won the 1968, 1972, and 1974 elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980, and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election. Trudeau is the most recent prime minister to win four elections (having won three majority governments and one minority government) and to serve two non-consecutive terms. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada\\'s third-longest-serving prime minister, behind John A. Macdonald and William Lyon Mackenzie King.\\nDespite his personal motto, \"Reason before passion\",[1] Trudeau\\'s personality and policy decisions aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. While critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies, admirers praised what they considered to be the force of his intellect and his political acumen that maintained national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement. Trudeau suppressed the 1970 Quebec terrorist crisis by controversially invoking the War Measures Act, the third and last time in Canadian history that the act was brought into force. In addition, Quebec\\'s proposal to negotiate a sovereignty-association agreement with the federal government was overwhelmingly rejected in the 1980 Quebec referendum. In a bid to move the Liberal Party towards economic nationalism, Trudeau\\'s government oversaw the creation of Petro-Canada and launched the National Energy Program; the latter generated uproar in oil-rich Western Canada, leading to what many coined \"Western alienation\". In other domestic policy, Trudeau pioneered official bilingualism and multiculturalism, fostering a pan-Canadian identity. Trudeau\\'s foreign policy included making Canada more independent; he patriated the Constitution and established the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, actions that achieved full Canadian sovereignty. He formed close ties with the Soviet Union, China, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, putting him at odds with other capitalist Western nations.\\nIn his retirement, Trudeau practised law at the Montreal law firm of Heenan Blaikie. He also successfully campaigned against the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords (which proposed recognizing Quebec as a \"distinct society\"), arguing they would strengthen Quebec nationalism. Trudeau died in 2000. He is ranked highly among scholars in rankings of Canadian prime ministers, though some of his policies have been the subject of long-lasting debate. His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current prime minister, following the 2015 Canadian federal election; Justin Trudeau is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.\\nEarly life [ edit ]\\nThe Trudeau family can be traced to Marcillac-Lanville in France in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544–1589).[5] In 1659, the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was Étienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641–1712), a carpenter and home builder from La Rochelle.[6]\\nPierre Trudeau was born at home in Outremont, Montreal, Quebec, on October 18, 1919, to Charles-Émile \"Charley\" Trudeau (1887–1935), a French-Canadian businessman and lawyer, and Grace Elliott, who was of mixed Scottish and French-Canadian descent. He had an older sister named Suzette and a younger brother named Charles Jr.[8] Trudeau remained close to both siblings for his entire life. Trudeau attended the prestigious Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf (a private French Jesuit school), where he supported Quebec nationalism. Trudeau\\'s paternal grandparents were French-speaking Quebec farmers.[1] His father had acquired the B&A gas station chain (now defunct), some \"profitable mines, the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the Montreal Royals, the city\\'s minor-league baseball team\", by the time Trudeau was fifteen.[1] When his father died in Orlando, Florida, on April 10, 1935, Trudeau and each of his siblings inherited $5,000, a considerable sum at that time, which meant that he was financially secure and independent. His mother, Grace, \"doted on Pierre\" and he remained close to her throughout her long life. After her husband died, she left the management of her inheritance to others and spent a lot of her time working for the Roman Catholic Church and various charities, travelling frequently to New York, Florida, Europe, and Maine, sometimes with her children. Already in his late teens, Trudeau was \"directly involved in managing a large inheritance.\"\\nEarly education [ edit ]\\nFrom the age of six until twelve, Trudeau attended the primary school, Académie Querbes, in Outremont, where he became immersed in the Catholic religion. The school, which was for both English and French Catholics, was an exclusive school with very small classes and he excelled in mathematics and religion. From his earliest years, Trudeau was fluently bilingual, which would later prove to be a \"big asset for a politician in bilingual Canada.\"[13] As a teenager, he attended the Jesuit French-language Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a prestigious secondary school known for educating elite francophone families in Quebec.[15]\\nIn his seventh and final academic year, 1939–1940, Trudeau focused on winning a Rhodes Scholarship. In his application he wrote that he had prepared for public office by studying public speaking and publishing many articles in Brébeuf. His letters of recommendations praised him highly. Father Boulin, who was the head of the college, said that during Trudeau\\'s seven years at the college (1933–1940), he had won a \"hundred prizes and honourable mentions\" and \"performed with distinction in all fields\". Trudeau graduated from Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in 1940 at the age of twenty-one.\\nTrudeau did not win the Rhodes Scholarship. He consulted several people on his options, including Henri Bourassa, the economist Edmond Montpetit, and Father Robert Bernier, a Franco-Manitoban. Following their advice, he chose a career in politics and a degree in law at the Université de Montréal.\\nThe Second World War [ edit ]\\nIn his obituary, The Economist described Trudeau as \"parochial as a young man\", who \"dismissed the second world war as a squabble between the big powers, although he later regretted \\'missing one of the major events of the century\\'.\"[13] In his 1993 Memoir, Trudeau wrote that the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 and his father\\'s death were the two \"great bombshells\" that marked his teenage years. In his first year at university, the prime topics of conversation were the Battle of France, the Battle of Britain, and the London blitz. He wrote that in the early 1940s, when he was in his early twenties, he thought, \"So there was a war? Tough. It wouldn\\'t stop me from concentrating on my studies so long as that was possible...[I]f you were a French Canadian in Montreal [at that time], you did not automatically believe that this was a just war. In Montreal in the early 1940s, we still knew nothing about the Holocaust and we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers.\"\\nYoung Trudeau opposed conscription for overseas service, and in 1942 he campaigned for the anti-conscription candidate Jean Drapeau (later the mayor of Montreal) in Outremont. Trudeau described a speech he heard in Montreal by Ernest Lapointe, minister of justice and Prime Minister William Mackenzie King\\'s Quebec lieutenant. Lapointe had been a Liberal MP during the 1917 Conscription Crisis, in which the Canadian government had deployed up to 1,200 soldiers to suppress the Quebec City anti-conscription Easter Riots in March and April 1918. In a final and bloody conflict, armed rioters fired on the troops, and the soldiers returned fire. At least five men were killed by gunfire and there were over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage.[23]: 504 [24]: 60 In 1939, it was Lapointe who helped draft the Liberals\\' policy against conscription for service overseas. Lapointe was aware that a new conscription crisis would destroy national unity that Mackenzie King had been trying to build since the end of World War I.[25] Trudeau believed Lapointe had lied and broken his promise. His criticisms of King\\'s wartime policies, such as \"suspension of habeas corpus\", the \"farce of bilingualism and French-Canadian advancement in the army,\" and the \"forced \\'voluntary\\' enrolment\", was scathing.\\nAs a university student Trudeau joined the Canadian Officers\\' Training Corps (COTC), which trained at the local armoury in Montreal during the school term and undertook further training at Camp Farnham each summer. Although the National Resources Mobilization Act, enacted in 1940, originally provided that conscripts could not be required to serve outside of Canada,[27] in 1942 Parliament amended the act and removed that restriction.[28] The Conscription Crisis of 1944 arose in response to the invasion of Normandy in June 1944.\\nEducation [ edit ]\\nTrudeau continued his full-time studies in law at the Université de Montréal while in the COTC from 1940 until his graduation in 1943.\\nFollowing his graduation, Trudeau articled for a year and, in the fall of 1944, began his master\\'s in political economy at Harvard University\\'s Graduate School of Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government). In his Memoir, he admitted that it was at Harvard\\'s \"super-informed environment\", that he realized the \"historic importance\" of the war and that he had \"missed one of the major events of the century in which [he] was living. Harvard had become a major intellectual centre, as fascism in Europe led to the great intellectual migration to the United States.\\nTrudeau\\'s Harvard dissertation was on the topic of communism and Christianity. At Harvard, an American and predominantly Protestant university, Trudeau who was French Catholic and was for the first time living outside the province of Quebec, felt like an outsider. As his sense of isolation deepened, in 1947, he decided to continue his work on his Harvard dissertation in Paris, France. He studied at the Institut d\\'Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po). The Harvard dissertation remained unfinished when Trudeau briefly entered a doctoral program to study under the socialist economist Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE). This cemented Trudeau\\'s belief that Keynesian economics and social sciences were essential to the creation of the \"good life\" in a democratic society. Over a five-week period he attended many lectures and became a follower of personalism after being influenced most notably by Emmanuel Mounier. He also was influenced by Nikolai Berdyaev, particularly his book Slavery and Freedom.[37] Max and Monique Nemni argue that Berdyaev\\'s book influenced Trudeau\\'s rejection of nationalism and separatism.[37]\\nIn the summer of 1948, Trudeau embarked on world travels to find a sense of purpose. At the age of twenty-eight, he travelled to Poland where he visited Auschwitz, then Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the Middle East, including Turkey, Jordan and southern Iraq. Although he was wealthy, Trudeau travelled with a back pack in \"self-imposed hardship\".[13] He used his British passport instead of his Canadian passport in his travels through Pakistan, India, China, and Japan, often wearing local clothing to blend in. According to The Economist, when Trudeau returned to Canada in 1949 after an absence of five years, his mind was \"seemingly broadened\" from his studying at Harvard, the Institut d\\'Études Politiques, and the LSE and his travels. He was \"appalled at the narrow nationalism in his native French-speaking Quebec, and the authoritarianism of the province\\'s government\".[13]\\nQuiet Revolution [ edit ]\\nBeginning while Trudeau was travelling overseas, several events took place in Quebec that were precursors to the Quiet Revolution in Quebec. These include the 1948 release of the anti-establishment manifesto Refus global, the publication of Les insolences du Frère Untel, the 1949 Asbestos Strike, and the 1955 Richard Riot. Artists and intellectuals in Quebec signed the Refus global on August 9, 1948, in opposition to the repressive rule of Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis and the decadent \"social establishment\" in Quebec, including the Catholic Church.[41][42] When he returned to Montreal in 1949, Trudeau quickly became a leading figure opposing Duplessis\\'s rule. Trudeau actively supported the workers in the Asbestos Strike who opposed Duplessis in 1949. Trudeau was the co-founder and editor of Cité Libre, a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the Quiet Revolution. In 1956, he edited an important book on the subject, La grève de l\\'amiante, which argued that the asbestos miners\\' strike of 1949 was a seminal event in Quebec\\'s history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, Francophone clerical establishment and Anglophone business class that had long ruled the province.\\nCareer [ edit ]\\nBecause of his labour union activities in Asbestos, Trudeau was blacklisted by Premier Duplessis and was unable to teach law at the Université de Montréal.[13] He surprised his closest friends in Quebec when he became a civil servant in Ottawa in 1949. Until 1951 he worked in the Privy Council Office of the Liberal Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent as an economic policy advisor. He wrote in his memoirs that he found this period very useful later on, when he entered politics, and that senior civil servant Norman Robertson tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay on.\\nHis progressive values and his close ties with Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) intellectuals (including F. R. Scott, Eugene Forsey, Michael Kelway Oliver and Charles Taylor) led to his support of and membership in that federal democratic socialist party throughout the 1950s.\\nAn associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal from 1961 to 1965, Trudeau\\'s views evolved towards a liberal position in favour of individual rights counter to the state and made him an opponent of Québec nationalism. He admired the labour unions, which were tied to the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first.[45] In economic theory he was influenced by professors Joseph Schumpeter and John Kenneth Galbraith while he was at Harvard. In 1963, Trudeau criticized the Liberal Party of Lester Pearson when it supported arming Bomarc missiles in Canada with nuclear warheads.\\nTrudeau was offered a position at Queen\\'s University teaching political science by James Corry, who later became principal of Queen\\'s, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Quebec.\\nEarly political career (1965–1967) [ edit ]\\nTrudeau after being nominated to represent the riding of Mount Royal, June 6, 1965\\nIn 1965, Trudeau joined the Liberal party, along with his friends Gérard Pelletier and Jean Marchand. Dubbed the \"three wise men\" by the media, they ran successfully for the Liberals in the 1965 election. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of Mount Royal, in Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities. His decision to join the Liberal Party of Canada rather than the CCF\\'s successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP) was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power. He also doubted the feasibility of the centralizing policies of the party. He felt that the party leadership tended toward a \"deux nations\" approach he could not support.\\nUpon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as Prime Minister Lester Pearson\\'s parliamentary secretary, and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the United Nations. In 1967, he was appointed to Pearson\\'s cabinet as minister of justice and attorney general.\\nMinister of justice and attorney general (1967–1968) [ edit ]\\nOmnibus bill Trudeau speaking about his omnibus bill , famously saying \"there\\'s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\"\\nAs minister of justice and attorney general, Trudeau was responsible for introducing the landmark Criminal Law Amendment Act, an omnibus bill whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, new gun ownership restrictions and the legalization of contraception, abortion and lotteries, as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers. Trudeau famously defended the segment of the bill decriminalizing homosexual acts by telling reporters that \"there\\'s no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\", adding that \"what\\'s done in private between adults doesn\\'t concern the Criminal Code\". Trudeau paraphrased the term from Martin O\\'Malley\\'s editorial piece in The Globe and Mail on December 12, 1967. Trudeau also liberalized divorce laws, and clashed with Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson, Sr. during constitutional negotiations.\\nLiberal leadership convention (1968) [ edit ]\\nTrudeau at the Liberal convention after winning the leadership\\nAt the end of Canada\\'s centennial year in 1967, Prime Minister Pearson announced his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered the race for the Liberal leadership. His energetic campaign attracted widespread media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. However, many Liberals still had reservations, given that he had joined the party as recently as 1965. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister Judy LaMarsh was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau wasn\\'t a Liberal.[52]\\nNevertheless, at the April 1968 Liberal leadership convention, Trudeau was elected leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51 percent of the delegates. He defeated several prominent and long-serving Liberals, including Paul Martin Sr., Robert Winters and Paul Hellyer.[53]\\nPrime Minister (1968–1979) [ edit ]\\nSwearing-in, subsequent election [ edit ]\\nAs the new leader of the governing Liberals, Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister on April 20. Though the Liberals\\' mandate was not due to expire until November 1970, Pearson\\'s government had almost fallen before the leadership contest could even take place, after a tax bill was voted down in parliament, leading to much confusion over whether this counted as a de facto motion of no confidence in the government. The Governor General, Roland Michener ultimately ruled that it did not, and the government subsequently won an actual confidence motion, but the incident made it clear that the minority government that Trudeau had inherited would not realistically last the full parliamentary term, and that he would soon need to call an early election in order to win a majority in parliament.[54]\\nTrudeau soon called an election, for June 25. His election campaign benefited from an unprecedented wave of personal popularity called \"Trudeaumania\",[55] which saw Trudeau mobbed by throngs of youths. Trudeau\\'s main national opponents were PC leader Robert Stanfield and NDP leader Tommy Douglas, both popular figures who had been Premiers, respectively, of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan (albeit in Trudeau\\'s native Quebec, the main competition to the Liberals was from the Ralliement créditiste, led by Réal Caouette). As a candidate Trudeau espoused participatory democracy as a means of making Canada a \"Just Society\". He defended vigorously the newly implemented universal health care and regional development programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.\\nOn the eve of the election, during the annual Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day parade in Montreal, rioting Quebec sovereignists threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting \"Trudeau au poteau!\" (Trudeau – to the stake!). Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the defiant prime minister impressed the public. The next day, Trudeau handily won the 1968 election with a strong majority government; this was the Liberals\\' first majority since 1953.\\nSocial policy [ edit ]\\nBilingualism and multiculturalism [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s first major legislative push was implementing the majority of recommendations of Pearson\\'s Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism via the Official Languages Act, which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the federal government.[60] More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was the implementation of the Act\\'s principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada that they were being disadvantaged.\\nTrudeau\\'s Cabinet fulfilled Part IV of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism\\'s report by announcing a \"Multiculturalism Policy\" on October 8, 1971. It was the first of its kind in the world, and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern. Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau\\'s predecessor Lester B. Pearson. This recognized that while Canada was a country of two official languages, it recognized a plurality of cultures – \"a multicultural policy within a bilingual framework\". This annoyed public opinion in Quebec, which believed that it challenged Quebec\\'s claim of Canada as a country of two nations.\\nImmigration [ edit ]\\nDuring the refugee crisis caused by the flight of the so-called \"boat people\" from Vietnam as thousands of people, mostly ethnic Chinese, fled Communist Vietnam in makeshift boats across the South China Sea, usually to the British colony of Hong Kong, the Trudeau government was generous in granting asylum to the refugees. By 1980, Canada had accepted about 44,000 of the \"boat people\", making it one of the top destinations for them.\\nIndigenous issues [ edit ]\\nIn 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chrétien, proposed the 1969 White Paper (officially entitled \"Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy\"). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada\\'s aboriginal population. The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the Indian Act and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government\\'s proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.[67][68]\\nDeath penalty [ edit ]\\nOn July 14, 1976, after a long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the death penalty completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.[69]\\nQuebec [ edit ]\\nOctober Crisis [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s first serious test came during the October Crisis of 1970, when a Marxist-influenced group, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped British Trade Consul James Cross at his residence on October 5. Five days later Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte was also kidnapped. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Premier of Quebec Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the War Measures Act which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis, answering the question of how far he would go to stop the violence by saying \"Just watch me\". Laporte was found dead on October 17 in the trunk of a car. The cause of his death is still debated.[70] Five of the FLQ members were flown to Cuba in 1970 as part of a deal in exchange for James Cross\\' life, although they eventually returned to Canada years later, where they served time in prison.\\nAlthough this response is still controversial and was opposed at the time as excessive by parliamentarians like Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, it was met with only limited objections from the public.\\nQuebec provincial affairs [ edit ]\\nAfter consultations with the provincial premiers, Trudeau agreed to attend a conference called by British Columbia Premier W. A. C. Bennett to attempt to finally patriate the Canadian constitution. Negotiations with the provinces by Minister of Justice John Turner created a draft agreement, known as the Victoria Charter, that entrenched a charter of rights, bilingualism, and a guarantee of a veto of constitutional amendments for Ontario and Quebec, as well as regional vetoes for Western Canada and Atlantic Canada, within the new constitution. The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, while Quebec\\'s premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet. After a strong backlash of popular opinion against the agreement in Quebec, Bourassa stated Quebec would not accept it.\\nTrudeau faced increasing challenges in Quebec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his Liberal government in Quebec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Quebec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, French language laws, and the language of air traffic control in Quebec. Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government\\'s bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.\\nPartially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a surprise election in 1976 that resulted in René Lévesque and the Parti Québécois (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and Lévesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau\\'s intellectualism contrasting with Lévesque\\'s more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the \"clarity\" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the sovereignist movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.\\nAs the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press. Trudeau\\'s reserve was seen as dignified by contemporaries and his poll numbers actually rose during the height of coverage, but aides felt the personal tensions left him uncharacteristically emotional and prone to outbursts.\\nEconomic policy [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s first government implemented many procedural reforms to make Parliament and the Liberal caucus meetings run more efficiently, significantly expanded the size and role of the Prime Minister\\'s office, and substantially expanded social-welfare programs.[83]\\nDeficit spending [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s government ran large budget deficits throughout its time in office.[84] The government\\'s first budget in 1968 produced a deficit of $667 million, while the 1969 budget produced a surplus of $140 million. However, the 1970 budget (which produced a deficit of over $1 billion) marked the start of consecutive budget deficits ran by the Trudeau government; the budget would not be balanced until 1997. By the time Trudeau\\'s first tenure ended in 1979, the deficit grew to $12 billion.[85]\\nSocial programs and spending [ edit ]\\nIn 1971, Trudeau\\'s government greatly expanded unemployment insurance, making coverage nearly universal as coverage for the Canadian labour force jumped to 96 percent from 75 percent. The system was sometimes called the 8/42, because one had to work for eight weeks (with at least 20 hours per week), and wait two weeks, to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. This expansion also opened the UI program up to maternity, sickness, and retirement benefits, covered seasonal workers for the first time, and allowed mothers to receive up to 15 weeks of benefits if they had 20 or more insurable weeks. The reforms increased the maximum benefit period to 50 weeks, though the benefit duration was calculated using a complex formula depending on labour force participation and the regional and national unemployment rates.[86][87][88][89] In 1977, the government simplified the benefit duration formula but introduced a variable entrance requirement dependent on the unemployment rate in the applicant\\'s region; the changes also mandated that workers in areas with low unemployment regions work twice as long to be eligible for benefits as workers in high unemployment regions.[88]\\nIn 1973, Trudeau\\'s government amended the National Housing Act to provide financial assistance for new home buying, loans for co-operative housing, and low interest loans for municipal and private non-profit housing.[90] The amendments saw the introduction the Rental Rehabilitation Assistance Program, which established that homeowners and occupants in low income neighborhoods could qualify for small grants to be used for home repair. Also introduced was the Assisted Home Ownership Program which allowed the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to start providing grants and subsidized interest rates to low income families (though in 1978 an amendment discontinued the provision of grant money to these families, which led to a high incidence of defaults, and in turn, necessitated that the federal government provide financial assistance to the CMHC). The amendments saw the passage of the Rent Supplement Act, which enabled the CMHC to partner with private landlords, cooperatives, and not-for-profit associations to provide affordable housing; in addition, the act saw the CMHC agree to fund the difference between market rental prices and rent prices geared to the specific occupant\\'s income. Lastly, the Canada Rental Supply Program was introduced to provide interest-free loans for 15 years to developers who agreed to allocate a proportion of units toward social housing initiatives. In order to ensure that loans contributed to the provision of low income housing, the CMHC was restricted to giving loans amounting to $7500 or less per unit.[91][92]\\nThe Registered home ownership savings plan (RHOSP) was introduced in the government\\'s November 1974 budget. Similar to RRSPs, proceeds from the RHOSP could be received tax-free for either[93] a down payment for the acquisition of an owner-occupied dwelling or to buy furnitures for the dwelling (or the spouse\\'s dwelling).[94] Individuals who already owned a home (either owner-occupied or rented to another person) could not deduct RHOSP contributions.[95][96] In 1976, Trudeau\\'s government allowed for transfers of funds between the RHOSP (for instance to select a plan with better returns).[97] In 1977, the government tightened the rules of the RHOSP (the reforms removed the purchase of furnitures from the list of usage allowed for tax-free use of RHOSP proceeds starting in 1978; disallowed deductible contributions for a taxpayer whose spouse owned a home; suspended tax-free rollover of RHSOP funds to an RRSP; and capped the lifetime of the RHOSP at 20 years).\\nIn 1977, Trudeau\\'s government established the financial program Established Programs Financing to help finance the provincially-run healthcare and post-secondary education system, through transfer payments, by cash and tax points. This system lasted until 1995.[89][102][103]\\nIn 1979, Trudeau\\'s government restructured family allowances by increasing the role of the tax system in child support and decreasing the role of family allowances. The government established an annual Refundable Child Tax Credit of $200 for families with incomes of $18,000 or less. As incomes increased above this level, benefits would be taxed away to disappear completely at $26,000. Since the median income for families during this time was $19,500, the majority of families received some benefit from the new program.[104]\\nTaxation [ edit ]\\nIn 1969, Trudeau\\'s first finance minister, Edgar Benson, introduced a white paper on tax reform which included tax deductions for child care and advocated shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy. Measures to fulfill the latter proposal included a capital gains tax, which was severely criticized by corporate Canada and the business community (notably Israel Asper). The bill was debated in Parliament for over a year, with its more radical proposals being removed in parliamentary committee. The reforms managed to be passed through the use of closure, with the capital gains tax (that had an inclusion rate of 50 percent) coming into effect on January 1, 1972, as prescribed by the 1971 budget.[105][106][107] Also implemented in 1972 was the child care expense deduction which allowed for a deduction of up to $500 per child.[108] As Benson had now become a political liability, Trudeau replaced him with John Turner (who was seen as a \"Business Liberal\") in 1972.[105][109]\\nIn 1973, Trudeau\\'s government fully indexed the person income tax system (both the exemptions and the brackets) to match inflation. The indexation was made effective in 1974; during that year, inflation had jumped from six percent to double digits.[110] The government also implemented three personal income tax cuts from 1973 to 1975.\\nInflation [ edit ]\\nWhile popular with the electorate, Trudeau\\'s promised minor reforms had little effect on the growing rate of inflation, and he struggled with conflicting advice on the crisis. In September 1975, finance minister John Turner resigned over refusing to implement wage and price controls.[113] In December 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister Donald Macdonald introduced wage and price controls by passing the Anti-Inflation Act, despite campaigning against them in the 1974 election. Amongst its many controls, it limited pay increases for federal government employees and employees in companies with over 500 workers to 10 percent in 1976, 8 percent in 1977, and 6 percent in 1978. The Act also established the anti-inflation board which oversaw the implementation of wage and price controls and had the ability to recommend decreases in prices of goods, wage cuts, and rebates to customers of various services.[114] The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted a Supreme Court reference that only upheld the legislation as an emergency requiring Federal intervention under the British North America Act. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with CTV, Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly neoliberal business leaders. The controls lasted until 1978 and the anti-inflation board was dissolved in 1979.[114]\\nEnergy policy [ edit ]\\nOn September 4, 1973, Trudeau requested Western Canadian provinces to agree to a voluntary freeze on oil prices during the ongoing Arab oil embargo. Nine days after, the Trudeau government imposed a 40-cent tax on every barrel of Canadian oil exported to the United States to combat rising inflation and oil prices. The tax was equivalent to the difference between domestic and international oil prices, and the revenues were used to subsidize oil imports for Eastern refiners. The Premier of oil-rich Alberta, Peter Lougheed, called the decision \"the most discriminatory action taken by a federal government against a particular province in the entire history of Confederation.\" While revenues decreased for Western provinces (particularly Alberta) and for the petroleum industry, Trudeau\\'s government subsidized Eastern consumers, angering Alberta, who successfully fought for control of its natural resources in 1930.[116]\\nIn the early 1970s, the petroleum industry was largely under foreign (mainly American) control, the recent discovery of oil in Alaska put corporate pressure on the Canadian Arctic, and Canada\\'s energy sector increasingly focused on North American rather than domestic needs. Trudeau\\'s government initially rejected the idea of creating a nationalized oil company (which was perceived to secure supplies, improve revenue collection, and give governments better information on the global energy market), arguing it would be costly and inefficient. However, after the late 1973 oil crisis saw global oil prices quadruple, questions arose about whether Canada should continue importing oil. Though Canada also exported oil at times, the provinces of Quebec and Atlantic Canada were at risk of a cut-off of imports; as a result, Canada was in need of knowing more about its potential to produce energy. In late October 1973, Trudeau\\'s government adopted a motion from the New Democratic Party (which the Trudeau minority government relied on for support) to establish a nationalized oil company. The Petro-Canada Act was passed in 1975 (under a Trudeau majority government), resulting in the creation of a new crown corporation, Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada was mandated to acquire imported oil supplies, take part in energy research and development, and engage in downstream activities such as refining and marketing. The corporation started with an initial $1.5 billion in capital and had preferential access to debt capital as \"an agent of Her Majesty\". Trudeau\\'s government gave itself authority over Petro-Canada\\'s capital budget and its corporate strategy, making the company its policy arm; the government also wanted the company to be mainly active on the frontiers (the oil sands, the Arctic, and the East Coast offshore areas) rather than Western Canada, where most Canadian oil is extracted. In 1976, Trudeau appointed his friend, Maurice Strong, to become the first chair of the company.[117]\\nForeign affairs [ edit ]\\nIn foreign affairs, Trudeau kept Canada in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but often pursued an independent path in international relations.\\nTrudeau was the first world leader to meet John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono on their 1969 \"tour for world peace\". Lennon said, after talking with Trudeau for 50 minutes, that Trudeau was \"a beautiful person\" and that \"if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace\". The diplomat John G. H. Halstead who worked as a close adviser to Trudeau for a time described him as a man who never read any of the policy papers submitted by the External Affairs department, instead preferring short briefings on the issues before meeting other leaders and that Trudeau usually tried to \"wing\" his way through international meetings by being witty. Halstead stated that Trudeau viewed foreign policy as \"only for dabbing\", saying he much preferred domestic affairs.\\nNATO [ edit ]\\nIn August 1968, the Trudeau government expressed disapproval of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, having the Canadian delegation at the United Nations vote for a resolution condemning the invasion, which failed to pass owing to a Soviet veto. However, Trudeau made it clear that he did not want an intensified Cold War as a result of the invasion, and worked to avoid a rupture with Moscow. In a speech in December 1968, Trudeau asked: \"Can we assume Russia wants war because it invaded Czechoslovakia?\".\\nIn 1968–1969, Trudeau wanted to pull Canada out of NATO, arguing that the MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) caused by a Soviet-American nuclear exchange made it highly unlikely that the Soviet Union would ever invade West Germany, thereby making NATO into an expensive irrelevance in his view. In March 1969, Trudeau visited Washington to meet President Richard Nixon, where the meeting went very civilly, through Nixon came to intensely dislike Trudeau over time, referring to him in 1971 as \"that asshole Trudeau\" Nixon made it clear to Trudeau that a Canada that remained in NATO would be taken more seriously in Washington than a Canada that left NATO. Trudeau himself noted during a speech given before the National Press Club during the same visit that the United States was by far Canada\\'s largest trading partner, saying: \"Living next to you is in some way like sleeping with an elephant; no matter how friendly and even-tempered the beast, one is affected by every twitch and grunt\".\\nThe NATO question badly divided the cabinet. The diplomat Marcel Cadieux accused Trudeau of being \"ne semble pas croire du tout au danger soviétique\". As a diplomat, the devout Catholic Cadieux had served on the International Control Commission in 1954–55, where his experiences of witnessing the exodus of 2 million Vietnamese Catholics from North Vietnam to South Vietnam made him into a very firm anti-Communist. In late March 1969, Trudeau\\'s cabinet was torn by debate as ministers divided into pro-NATO and anti-NATO camps, and Trudeau\\'s own feelings were with the latter. The Defence Minister Léo Cadieux threatened to resign in protest if Canada did leave NATO, leading Trudeau who wanted to keep a French-Canadian in a high-profile portfolio such as the Defence department, to meet Cadieux on 2 April 1969 to discuss a possible compromise. Trudeau and Cadieux agreed to the compromise that Canada would stay in NATO, but drastically cut back its contributions, despite warnings from Ross Campbell, the Canadian member of the NATO Council, that the scale of the cuts envisioned would break Canada\\'s treaty commitments. Ultimately, the fact the United States would be more favourably disposed to a Canada in NATO and the need to maintain cabinet unity led Trudeau to decide, despite his own inclinations, to stay in NATO. After much discussion within the cabinet, Trudeau finally declared that Canada would stay within NATO after all on 3 April 1969, but he would cut back Canada\\'s forces within Europe by 50%. The way that Canada cut its NATO contributions by 50% caused tensions with other NATO allies with the British government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson making a public protest at the cuts.\\nUnited States [ edit ]\\nTrudeau in his office in Ottawa with U.S. President Richard Nixon on April 14, 1972\\nRelations with the United States deteriorated on many points in the Nixon years (1969–74), including trade disputes, defence agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. On January 4, 1973, Trudeau voted for a resolution in the House of Commons that condemned the American Christmas bombings against North Vietnam between 18 and 29 December 1972. As a consequence, Canadian-American relations which were already under stress because of the mutual contempt between Nixon and Trudeau, reached a post-war nadir. Nixon was infuriated by the resolution and refused to see Marcel Cadieux, the Canadian ambassador in Washington, in protest for the rest of 1973. Nixon was only prevented from lashing out more by his desire to have Canada continued as the pro-Western member on the International Control Commission for Vietnam. Prompted by Halstead, who was known as a proponent of economic \"rebalancing\" by seeking closer economic ties with the EEC, Trudeau made a visit to Brussels in October 1973 to see François-Xavier Ortoli, the president of the European Commission, to ask for a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement. Halstead used Nixon\\'s displeasure with Canada as an argument that it was finally time for \"economic rebalancing\" by seeking closer ties with the EEC, a thesis that Halstead had been advocating ever since the early 1960s. Ortoli refused Trudeau\\'s request for a free trade agreement with the EEC, saying that was out of the question, but did agree to open talks on lowering tariffs between Canada and the EEC.\\nTrudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada\\'s international profile, including joining the G7 group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of U.S. President Gerald Ford. American-Canadian relations changed for the better when Trudeau and President Jimmy Carter found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"stagflation\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.[134]\\nUnited Kingdom and France [ edit ]\\nTrudeau attached little importance to relations with Britain. While he shot down a suggestion by one of his ministers to turn Canada into a republic in 1968, he treated the monarchy with a certain bemused contempt. Britain\\'s decision in 1973 to join the European Economic Community (EEC) as the European Union was then known, confirmed Trudeau\\'s view that the United Kingdom was a declining power that had little to offer Canada while the way that Japan had replaced Britain as Canada\\'s second-largest trading partner was taken as further confirmation of these views. However, Trudeau was attached to the Commonwealth, believing it was an international body that allowed Canada to project influence in the Third World as he noted it was one of the few bodies that allowed leaders from the First World and the Third World to meet on a regular basis. Through France was no longer as supportive of Quebec separatism as was under President Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s, but the way that French politicians throughout the 1970s expressed the thesis of a special Franco-Quebecois bond as opposed to a special Franco-Canadian bond led to tensions with Paris.\\nIn 1970–71, the Commonwealth was threatened with a split as a number of African Commonwealth nations supported by India denounced Britain\\'s policy of selling arms to South Africa, which the British government argued was necessary because South Africa was one of the world\\'s largest gold producers while the South African government was anti-Communist and pro-Western. The Labour Wilson government had imposed an arms embargo on South Africa in 1964, which the new Conservative Heath government ended in 1970. A number of African Commonwealth nations led by President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania threatened to leave the Commonwealth if Britain continued with the arms sales to South Africa. When British prime minister Edward Heath visited Ottawa in December 1970, his meetings with Trudeau went badly. In what was described as a \"no holds-barred\" style, Trudeau told Heath that the British arms sales to white supremacist South Africa were threatening the unity of the Commonwealth. At a Commonwealth summit in Singapore between 14 and 22 January 1971, Trudeau argued that apartheid was not sustainable in the long run given that the black population of South Africa vastly outnumbered the white population, and it was extremely myopic for Britain to be supporting South Africa, given that majority rule in South Africa was inevitable. However, Trudeau worked for a compromise to avoid a split in the Commonwealth, arguing that the Commonwealth needed to do more to pressure South Africa to end apartheid peacefully, saying that a \"race war\" in South Africa would be the worse possible way to end apartheid. The conference ended with the compromise agreement that Britain would complete its existing arms contracts to South Africa, but henceforward sell no more weapons to South Africa; ultimately the British only sold South Africa five attack helicopters. Lee Kuan Yew, the prime minister of Singapore and the host of the conference later praised Trudeau for his efforts at the Commonwealth summit to hold together the Commonwealth despite the passions caused by the South African issue.\\nGermany [ edit ]\\nTrudeau had an especially close friendship with the Social Democratic West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, whom he greatly liked both for his left-wing politics and as a practical politician who was more concerned about getting things done rather than with ideological questions. Schmidt was sympathetic towards Trudeau\\'s \"rebalancing\" concept, telling Trudeau that he wanted West Germany to have two North American partners instead of one, and promised at a 1975 meeting to use West German influence within the EEC to grant Canada better trade terms in exchange for Canada spending more on its NATO commitments. After meeting Schmidt, Trudeau performed a volte-face on NATO, speaking at a press conference of how much he valued NATO as an alliance that was established for collective security in Europe. To show his approval of Schmidt, Trudeau not only agreed to spend more on NATO, but insisted that the Canadian Army buy the German-built Leopard tanks, which thereby boosted the West German arms industry, over the opposition of the Finance department, which felt that buying the Leopard tanks was wasteful. Schmidt\\'s support was especially welcome as Wilson, once again back as the British prime minister, proved unwilling to lobby for the EEC lowering tariffs on Canadian goods, merely saying that he was willing \"to interpret Canadian policy\" to the other EEC leaders. By contrast, the West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher gave Trudeau a firm promise of West German support for an EEC-Canadian economic agreement. The major hold-out was France, which was stoutly opposed to an EEC-Canadian agreement, seeing giving EEC market access to Canadian agriculture as a threat to French agriculture. In July 1976 a Canadian-EEC Framework Economic Agreement was signed, which came into effect on 1 October 1976. Trudeau hoped would be the Framework Agreement would be the first step towards a Canadian-EEC free trade agreement, but the EEC proved to be uninterested in free trade with Canada.\\nChina [ edit ]\\nTrudeau established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People\\'s Republic of China before the United States did in 1979, and went on an official visit to Beijing. On 10 February 1969, the government announced its wish to establish diplomatic relations with the People\\'s Republic, and Trudeau was mortified when the Chinese refused to respond at first, which made him look foolish. Unknown to Trudeau, the Chinese diplomatic corps had been so thoroughly purged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that the Chinese Foreign Ministry barely functioned by early 1969. On 19 February 1969, the Chinese finally responded and agreed to open talks in Stockholm on establishing diplomatic relations, which began on 3 April 1969. Trudeau expected the negotiations to be a mere formality, but relations were not finally established until October 1970. The delay was largely because the Chinese insisted that Canada have no relations whatsoever with \"the Chiang Kai-shek gang\" as they called the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan and agree to support the Chinese position that Taiwan was a part of the People\\'s Republic, a position that caused problems on the Canadian side as it implied Canadian support for China\\'s viewpoint that it had the right to take Taiwan by force into the People\\'s Republic. On 10 October 1970, a statement was issued by the External Affairs department in Ottawa saying: \"The Chinese government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People\\'s Republic of China. The Canadian government takes note of the Chinese position\". After the statement was issued, China and Canada established diplomatic relations on the same day. The so-called \"Canadian formula\" under which a nation \"takes note\" of the Chinese viewpoint that Taiwan is part of the People\\'s Republic has been often copied by other nations that have established diplomatic relations with Beijing, most notably the United States in 1979. In October 1973, Trudeau visited Beijing to meet Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, where Trudeau was hailed as \"old friend\"-a term of high approval in China.\\nIn 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the Chinese government, issued an order barring Taiwan from participating as China in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, although technically it was a matter for the IOC.[153] His action strained relations with the United States – from President Ford, future President Carter and the press – and subjected Canada to international condemnation and shame.[154][153]\\nTrudeau and Castro [ edit ]\\nTrudeau was known as a friend of Fidel Castro, the leader of Cuba. In January 1976, Trudeau visited Cuba to meet Castro and shouted to a crowd in Havana \"Viva Cuba! Viva Castro!\" (\"Long Live Cuba! Long Live Castro!\"). In November 1975, Cuba had intervened in the Angolan Civil War on the side of the Marxist MPLA government supported by the Soviet Union which was fighting against the UNITA and FNLA guerrilla movements supported by the United States, South Africa and Zaire (the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo). Though both Zaire and South Africa had also intervened in Angola, sending in troops to support the FLNA and UNITA respectively, it was the Cuban intervention in Angola that caused the controversy in the West. Many people in the West saw the Cuban intervention as \"aggression\", and as a power play by the Soviet Union to win a sphere of influence in Africa. Angola was amply endowed with oil, and many saw the victory of the MPLA/Cuban forces in the first round of the Angolan civil war in 1975–1976 as a major blow to Western interests in Africa. Trudeau\\'s remarks in Havana were widely seen in the West as not only expressing approval of Cuba\\'s Communist government, but also the Cuban intervention in Angola. In fact, Trudeau did press Castro in private to pull his troops out of Angola, only for Castro to insist that Cuba would pull its forces out of Angola only when South Africa likewise pulled its forces out of not only Angola, but also Southwest Africa (modern Namibia) as well. Trudeau\\'s embrace of Castro attracted much criticism in the United States, which allowed Trudeau to pose as a leader who was \"standing up\" to the United States without seriously damaging American-Canadian relations.\\nReelections [ edit ]\\n1972 election [ edit ]\\nOn September 1, 1972, over four years into the Liberals\\' five-year mandate, Trudeau called an election for October 30. At the start of the campaign, polls showed the Liberals 10 points ahead of the Progressive Conservatives led by Robert Stanfield, who previously lost to Trudeau in the 1968 election. However, the results produced a Liberal minority government, with the Liberals winning 109 seats compared to the PCs\\' 107; this was one of the closest elections in Canadian history. Trudeaumania from the 1968 election had worn off, not least because of a slumping economy and rising unemployment. The New Democratic Party led by David Lewis held the balance of power.[157]\\n1974 election [ edit ]\\nIn May 1974, the House of Commons passed a motion of no confidence in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis. The election of 1974 focused mainly on the current economic recession. Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of wage and price controls to help end the increasing inflation Canada was currently facing. Trudeau mocked the proposal, saying to a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying \"Zap! You\\'re frozen\", and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation. According to Trudeau’s biographer John English, NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals during the campaign.\\nThe Liberals were re-elected with a majority government with 141 of the 264 seats, prompting Stanfield\\'s retirement. The Liberals won no seats in Alberta, though, where Peter Lougheed was a vociferous opponent of Trudeau\\'s 1974 budget.\\nDefeat in 1979 [ edit ]\\nAs the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau\\'s personality and the country\\'s constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s. At the 1978 G7 summit, he discussed strategies for the upcoming election with West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who advised him to announce several spending cuts to quell criticism of the large deficits his government was running.[163]\\nAfter a series of defeats in by-elections in 1978, Trudeau waited as long as he could to call a statutory general election in 1979. He finally did so in 1979, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the British North America Act.[1]\\nIn the election of 1979, Trudeau and the Liberals faced declining poll numbers and the Joe Clark–led Progressive Conservatives focusing on \"pocketbook\" issues. Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau\\'s decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public\\'s apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at Maple Leaf Gardens saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark\\'s struggles justifying his party\\'s populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.\\nThough winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Quebec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government.\\nOpposition (1979–1980) [ edit ]\\nTrudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.\\nHowever, before a leadership convention could be held, with Trudeau\\'s blessing and Allan MacEachen\\'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark\\'s budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a Westminster system, budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their failure automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139–133, thereby toppling Clark\\'s government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau\\'s main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Quebec sovereignty.\\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau\\'s role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a majority government.[167]\\nPrime Minister (1980–1984) [ edit ]\\nPrime Minister Trudeau in 1980\\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of Manitoba. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent\\'s NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.\\n1980 Quebec referendum [ edit ]\\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, 1980 Quebec referendum on Québec sovereignty, called by the Parti Québécois government under René Lévesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government\\'s policy of leaving the issue to the Quebec Liberals and Claude Ryan. He appointed Jean Chrétien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the \"association\" required consent from the other provinces.\\nIn the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum Lévesque said that Trudeau\\'s middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau\\'s aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French.[170] A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question. He described the origin of the name Canadian.[170] Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement should Quebec decide to stay in Canada, in which English-speaking Canadians would have to listen to valid concerns made by the Québécois. On May 20, sixty percent of Quebecers voted to remain in Canada. Following the announcement of the results, Trudeau said that he \"had never been so proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian\".\\nEconomy and oil [ edit ]\\nIn their first budget, delivered in October 1980 by Trudeau\\'s long-time loyalist, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen, the National Energy Program was introduced. It became one of the Liberals\\' most contentious policies. The NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces and was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.[172] The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEP which led to what many termed \"Western alienation\". Peter Lougheed, then premier of Alberta, entered into tough negotiations with Trudeau and they reached a revenue-sharing agreement on energy in 1982. Estimates have placed Alberta\\'s losses between $50 billion and $100 billion because of the NEP.[173][174]\\nThis first budget, was one of a series of unpopular budgets delivered in response to the oil shock of 1979 and the ensuing severe global economic recession which began at the start of 1980.[175][176] In his budget speech, MacEachen said that the global oil price shocks—in 1973 and again in 1979—had caused a \"sharp renewal of inflationary forces and real income losses\" in Canada and in the industrial world...They are not just Canadian problems ... they are world-wide problems.\"[177] Leaders of developed countries raised their concerns at the Venice Summit, at meetings of Finance Ministers of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[177] The Bank of Canada wrote that there was a \"deeply troubling air of uncertainty and anxiety\" about the economy.[177][178][179][180]\\nAmongst the policies introduced by Trudeau\\'s last term in office were an expansion in government support for Canada\\'s poorest citizens.[181] By the time Trudeau left office in 1984, the budget deficit was at a whopping $37 billion (fiscal year 1984–1985). Trudeau\\'s first budget (fiscal year 1968–1969) only had a deficit of $667 million. Inflation and unemployment marred much of Trudeau\\'s tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18 billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200 billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.[182]\\nPatriation of the constitution [ edit ]\\nIn 1982, Trudeau succeeded in patriating the Constitution.[1] In response to a formal request from the Canadian Houses of Parliament, the British Parliament passed an act ceding to the governments of Canada the full responsibility for amending Canada\\'s Constitution.[183] Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chrétien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Quebec referendum in which Quebecers voted to remain in Canada.\\nAfter chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier Bill Davis, and New Brunswick Premier Richard Hatfield and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their reference power, conflicting decisions prompted a Supreme Court decision that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a constitutional convention that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,[184] Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that Parliament and the provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a notwithstanding clause to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was Lévesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Quebec government to the new constitutional provisions became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Quebec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau\\'s reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\\nThe Constitution Act, 1982, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, on April 17, 1982. With the enactment of the Canada Act 1982, the British Parliament ceded all authority over Canada to the governments of Canada. The Constitution Act, 1982, part of the Canada Act 1982, established the supremacy of the Constitution of Canada, which now could only be amended by the federal and provincial governments, under the amending formula established by the Constitution Act, 1982.[183]\\nThe Charter represented the final step in Trudeau\\'s liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of Métis. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the Charter has been infrequently used.\\nResignation [ edit ]\\nBy 1984, the Progressive Conservatives held a substantial lead in opinion polls under their new leader Brian Mulroney, and polls indicated that the Liberals faced all-but-certain defeat if Trudeau led them into the next election.\\nOn February 29, 1984, a day after what he described as a walk through the snowy streets of Ottawa, Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election. He was frequently known to use the term \"walk in the snow\" as a trope; he claimed to have taken a similar walk in December 1979 before deciding to take the Liberals into the 1980 election.[185]\\nTrudeau formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as prime minister. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former Cabinet minister under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson. Before handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal Senators from Western provinces to his Cabinet. He advised Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage positions. He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees\\' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.[186] However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due.\\nTurner\\'s appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be cancelled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that \"I had no option\" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, \"You had an option, sir–to say \\'no\\'–and you chose to say \\'yes\\' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.\"[187] In the election, Mulroney won the largest majority government (by total number of seats) and second-largest majority (by proportion of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats–at the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level (by proportion of seats) at the time.\\nAfter politics (1984–2000) [ edit ]\\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm Heenan Blaikie as counsel and settled in the historic Maison Cormier in Montreal following his retirement from politics.[188] Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. The Meech Lake Accord granted Quebec the constitutional right to be a \"distinct society\" within Canada, which theoretically could have been the basis of a wide-ranging devolution of power to Quebec. The Quebec government potentially could have been allowed to pass any law short of secession to protect Quebec\\'s constitutional right to be a \"distinct society\". Trudeau claimed in his speeches that giving Quebec the constitutional status of a \"distinct society\" would lead to the Quebec government deporting members of Quebec\\'s English-speaking minority.[189] His opposition to both accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Québécois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the Club of Rome. He met with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President Ronald Reagan to discuss easing world tensions.\\nHe published his memoirs in 1993. The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\\nIn his old age, he was afflicted with Parkinson\\'s disease and prostate cancer, and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80. He was devastated by the death of his youngest son, Michel Trudeau, who was killed in an avalanche on November 13, 1998.\\nDeath [ edit ]\\nTrudeau family crypt\\nPierre Elliott Trudeau died on September 28, 2000, aged 80, and was buried in the Trudeau family crypt, St-Rémi-de-Napierville Cemetery, Saint-Rémi, Quebec.[191][192] His body lay in state in the Hall of Honour in Parliament Hill\\'s Centre Block to allow Canadians to pay their last respects. Several world politicians, including former US President Jimmy Carter and Fidel Castro, attended the funeral. His son Justin delivered the eulogy during the state funeral which led to widespread speculation in the media that a career in politics was in his future.\\nPersonal life [ edit ]\\nReligious beliefs [ edit ]\\nTrudeau was a Roman Catholic and attended Mass throughout his life. While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the United Church Observer in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I\\'m a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.\\nMichael W. Higgins, a former president of Catholic St. Thomas University, researched Trudeau\\'s spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the Jesuits who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau\\'s life was Dominican. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at Dominican University College, Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\".[attribution needed] He studied philosophy under Dominican Father Louis-Marie Régis and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding Régis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another skein in Trudeau\\'s spirituality was a contemplative aspect acquired from his association with the Benedictine tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of meditation in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into Transcendental Meditation by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[195] He took retreats at Saint-Benoît-du-Lac, Quebec and regularly attended Hours and the Eucharist at Montreal\\'s Benedictine community.\\nAlthough never publicly theological in the way of Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair, nor evangelical, in the way of Jimmy Carter or George W. Bush, Trudeau\\'s spirituality, according to Michael W. Higgins, \"suffused, anchored, and directed his inner life. In no small part, it defined him.\"\\nMarriage and children [ edit ]\\nDescribed as a \"swinging young bachelor\" when he became prime minister, in 1968,[197] Trudeau was reportedly dating Hollywood star Barbra Streisand in 1969[198] and 1970.[199][200] While a serious romantic relationship, there was no express marriage proposal, contrary to one contemporary published report.[201]\\nOn March 4, 1971, while prime minister, Trudeau quietly married 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair, who was 29 years younger, at St. Stephen\\'s Roman Catholic parish church in North Vancouver.[202]\\nBelying his publicized social exploits, and nicknames like \"Swinging Pierre\"[203] and \"Trendy Trudeau\";[204] he was an intense intellectual with robust work habits and little time for family or fun. As a result, Margaret felt trapped and bored in the marriage, feelings that were exacerbated by her bipolar depression, with which she was later diagnosed.\\nTrudeau\\'s eldest son Justin (23rd Prime Minister of Canada) at the age of 10, touring the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille with his father on November 8, 1982\\nThe couple had three sons: the first two, 23rd and current Prime Minister Justin (born 1971), and Alexandre (born 1973), were both born on Christmas Day two years apart. Their third son, Michel (1975–1998), died in an avalanche while skiing in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. Trudeau and Margaret separated in 1977, and were divorced in 1984. He was involved with guitarist Liona Boyd for eight years during this time. [208]\\nWhen his divorce was finalized in 1984, Trudeau became the first Canadian prime minister to become a single parent as the result of divorce. In 1984, Trudeau was romantically involved with Margot Kidder (a Canadian actress famous for her role as Lois Lane in Superman: The Movie and its sequels) in the last months of his prime-ministership[209] and after leaving office.[210]\\nIn 1991, Trudeau became a father again, with Deborah Margaret Ryland Coyne, to his only daughter, Sarah.[211] Coyne later stood for the 2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election and came fifth[212] in a poll won by Justin.\\nTrudeau began practising judo sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade, he was ranked ikkyū (brown belt). Later, when he travelled to Japan as prime minister, he was promoted to shodan (first-degree black belt) by the Kodokan, and then promoted to nidan (second-degree black belt) by Masao Takahashi in Ottawa before leaving office. Trudeau began the night of his famous \"walk in the snow\" before announcing his retirement in 1984 by going to judo with his sons.[213]\\nIntellectual contributions [ edit ]\\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a federalist model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Quebec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis\\' time in power.[214][unreliable source?]\\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples ... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".[215][unreliable source?]\\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on social democracy with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government. In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:\\n[R]ather than water down ... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government\\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people.\"\\nTrudeau\\'s idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a \\'nation\\' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates—emotive and particularistic—to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".[218][unreliable source?]\\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Quebec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.[218][unreliable source?] First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chrétien.\\nTrudeau and the Quebec federalist historian Fernand Ouellet, who was a devout follower and admirer of Trudeau and Trudeauism, frequently influenced each other intellectually in their ideas and texts on their anti-nationalist conception of the history of Quebec, though they never formed a personal friendship.[219]\\nLegacy [ edit ]\\nTrudeau remains well regarded by many Canadians.[220] However, the passage of time has only slightly softened the strong antipathy he inspired among his opponents.[221][222] Trudeau\\'s strong personality, contempt for his opponents and distaste for compromise on many issues have made him, as historian Michael Bliss puts it, \"one of the most admired and most disliked of all Canadian prime ministers\".[223] \"He haunts us still\", biographers Christina McCall and Stephen Clarkson wrote in 1990.[224] Trudeau\\'s electoral successes were matched in the 20th century only by those of William Lyon Mackenzie King.[225][226]\\nTrudeau\\'s most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to Canadian nationalism, and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the British Commonwealth. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Quebec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced—and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"just watch me\", the \"Trudeau Salute\", and \"Fuddle Duddle\".\\nMaclean\\'s 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys ranked him twice as the fifth best Canadian prime minister, and in 2016, the fourth best.[227][228] The CBC\\'s special on The Greatest Canadian saw him ranked as the third greatest Canadian of all time, behind Tommy Douglas and Terry Fox, from the over 1.2 million votes cast by watchers of the program.\\nBilingualism [ edit ]\\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau\\'s most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government\\'s services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for full bilingualism in New Brunswick and some French language service rights in Ontario and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\\nHowever, Trudeau\\'s ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau\\'s vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which all cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Quebec to Canada.\\nConstitutional legacy [ edit ]\\nThe Charter of Rights and Freedoms was one of Trudeau\\'s most enduring legacies.[1] It is seen as advancing civil rights and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. Court challenges based on the Charter have been used to advance the cause of women\\'s equality, establish French school boards in provinces with majority anglophone populations, and provide constitutional protection to English school boards in Quebec. Court actions under the Charter resulted in the adoption of same-sex marriage all across Canada by the federal Parliament.\\nLegacy in western Canada [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s posthumous reputation in the western provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\". To many westerners, Trudeau\\'s policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially Ontario and Québec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich Alberta.[172] In British Columbia, Premier W. A. C. Bennett in 1970 argued that Trudeau\\'s government is Quebec nationalist-oriented. He also implied that Quebec received special treatment from Ottawa as a result.[229]\\nMore particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters\\' concerns with \"Why should I sell your wheat?\" – however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself.[230] Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window – less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.[231]\\nLegacy in Quebec [ edit ]\\nTrudeau\\'s legacy in Quebec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) as a force in Quebec, and ensuring that the campaign for Quebec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his imposition of the War Measures Act—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Quebec during his time as prime minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Québec seats in the 1980 federal election. Provincially, though, Québécois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Québécois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the Bloc Québécois. Since the signing of the Constitution Act, 1982 in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Quebec. He was disliked by the Québécois nationalists.[232]\\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\\nTrudeau is a 2002 television miniseries which aired on CBC Television. It was written by Wayne Grigsby, directed by Jerry Ciccoritti and features Colm Feore in the title role.[233]\\nA prequel, Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making, was released in 2005. The four-hour CBC production examines Trudeau\\'s early life. Stéphane Demers performs in the role.[234]\\nSupreme Court appointments [ edit ]\\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General:\\nHonours [ edit ]\\nAccording to Canadian protocol, as a former prime minister, he was styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life.\\nCoat of arms of Pierre Trudeau[237]\\nThe following honours were bestowed upon him by the Governor General, or by Queen Elizabeth II herself:\\nOther honours include:\\nThe Canadian news agency Canadian Press named Trudeau \"Newsmaker of the Year\" a record ten times, including every year from 1968 to 1975, and two more times in 1978 and 2000. In 1999, CP also named Trudeau \"Newsmaker of the 20th Century\". Trudeau declined to give CP an interview on that occasion, but said in a letter that he was \"surprised and pleased.\" In informal and unscientific polls conducted by Canadian Internet sites, users also widely agreed with the honour.\\nIn 1983–84, he was awarded the Albert Einstein Peace Prize, for negotiating the reduction of nuclear weapons and Cold War tension in several countries.\\nIn 2004, viewers of the CBC series The Greatest Canadian voted Trudeau the third greatest Canadian.\\nvoted Trudeau the third greatest Canadian. Trudeau was awarded a 2nd dan black belt in judo by the Takahashi School of Martial Arts in Ottawa. [241]\\nTrudeau was ranked No.5 of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through Jean Chrétien in a survey of Canadian historians. The survey was used in the book Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada\\'s Leaders by Jack Granatstein and Norman Hillmer.\\nby Jack Granatstein and Norman Hillmer. In 2009 Trudeau was posthumously inducted into the Q Hall of Fame Canada, Canada\\'s Prestigious National LGBT Human Rights Hall of Fame, for his pioneering efforts in the advancement of human rights and equality for all Canadians.[242]\\nHonorary degrees [ edit ]\\nTrudeau received several Honorary Degrees in recognition of his political career.\\nHonorary Degrees\\nHonorific eponyms [ edit ]\\nGeographic locations\\nSchools\\nParks\\nOntario: Pierre Elliot Trudeau Park, Vaughan, Ontario – park also has a statue of Trudeau.\\nOrganisations\\nOrder of Canada citation [ edit ]\\nTrudeau was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on June 24, 1985.

Lending substance to the phrase \"the style is the man,\" he has imparted, both in his and on the world stage, his quintessentially personal philosophy of modern politics.\\nMajor biographies [ edit ]\\nIn 1990, Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall published a major biography Trudeau and Our Times in two volumes. Volume 1, The magnificent obsession reprinted in 1997, was the winner of the Governor General\\'s Award.[263][264] The most recent reprint was in 2006.\\nIn film [ edit ]\\nThrough hours of archival footage and interviews with Trudeau himself, the 1990 documentary Memoirs details the story of a man who used intelligence and charisma to bring together a country that was very nearly torn apart.[265]\\nTrudeau\\'s life was also depicted in two CBC Television mini-series. The first, Trudeau (2002, with Colm Feore in the title role), depicts his years as prime minister.

However, economics remains a powerful force. Trudeau suggested the long distances between Canada’s most prolific gas fields in Alberta and British Columbia to proposed liquefaction projects in places such as Saint John, N.B., have previously made direct export to Europe uneconomic. “We are looking right now and companies are looking at whether or not the new context makes it a worthwhile business case to make those investments,” Trudeau said, adding the federal government would be willing to ease regulatory hurdles to assist its allies. “But there needs to be a business case. It needs to make sense for Germany to be receiving LNG directly from the East Coast. Those are discussions that are ongoing right now between our ministers, between various companies to see if indeed it makes sense,” Trudeau said. The two leaders spoke at length about the challenge of safeguarding the energy security of Western democracies during the news conference in Montreal Monday. The leaders, along with numerous federal cabinet ministers, will gather this week for meetings on investment and partnership opportunities in the areas such as critical minerals and the automotive sector.\\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Trudeau said Canada’s best chance of helping its allies may be to continue supplying natural gas to global markets via existing pipelines to the United States, and then eventually through LNG exports on Canada’s West Coast, where the country’s only export terminal is under construction. “We are looking at every possible different way to help out the German people and Europeans in the short term as they face a real challenge this coming winter and the next as Russia continues to squeeze off gas supply,” Trudeau said. The German chancellor is facing an energy crisis at home where European natural gas prices have hit record levels on fears that Russian supply cuts could tip the German economy into recession. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February disrupted global energy flows, including the main route through which Russian gas flows to Germany: the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Gas flows on the key pipeline were temporarily halted last month for maintenance work and a second temporary shut down is anticipated on Aug. 31 — disruptions which have jeopardized the region’s plans to store additional gas for the winter.\\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Germany has been on the hunt for alternative sources of gas to end its dependence on Russia — but despite Canada’s abundant supply, the lack of an operational LNG export terminal has made it an unlikely near-term solution. Instead, discussions leading up to Scholz’s visit have centred around hydrogen. Germany has expressed an interest in “green” hydrogen from Canada, made using renewable power sources like wind. However, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Friday that Canada’s ally has not ruled out hydrogen made using natural gas and carbon capture — the method most common in Alberta where the bulk of Canada’s hydrogen is produced. Scholz is expected to sign an energy development agreement with Trudeau for the exploration and production of renewable hydrogen for export to Germany during his visit. The agreement will be signed when the pair visit Stephenville, N.L. on Tuesday. Recommended from Editorial 'A fine line': Canada's big banks have long stood by the oilpatch, but ESG pressures are changing things Germany shifts focus from gas to hydrogen on Canada trip: sources Judge sides with Enbridge in Michigan's latest bid to halt Line 5 pipeline\\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Despite the cool language from the prime minister on East Coast LNG, proponents of the sector say they’re encouraged that Ottawa is looking closely at the opportunities available. “I think the case is stronger than he’s giving it credit for,” said Timothy Egan, chief executive of the Canadian Gas Association. “The thing I draw from his comments is that he speaks about a willingness to revisit the regulatory framework. And if you revisit the regulatory framework, those business cases become stronger fast.” During Monday’s press conference Scholz also thanked the Trudeau government for its decision to exempt Siemens Canada from federal sanctions that would have prevented the company from performing maintenance on a gas turbine bound for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The exemption, which was opposed by Ukraine, allows the return of a repaired turbine for use in the pipeline owned by Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom. Both Trudeau and Scholz defended the move Monday, arguing that Moscow has sought to weaponize energy, reducing gas supplies to Europe while attempting to pit western governments against each other. Scholz’s visit began late Sunday and will end in Newfoundland on Tuesday with the signing of the hydrogen accord. The chancellor and Trudeau last met in June on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Germany where the pair reportedly discussed energy security and accelerating the global transition to clean energy.

      "{'authors': ['Jason Markusoff'], 'date': '2018-05-29 23:26:45', 'title': \"With Trudeau's Trans Mountain deal, Alberta's Ottawa-hates-us narrative is hard to justify\", 'content': 'While there are many Canadians with mixed emotions about the federal government’s $4.5-billion rescue purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, spare a thought for two particular groups: the hardcore protesters who spent hours making giant “Stop Kinder Morgan” signs, and the pro-pipeline Albertans convinced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secretly wanted to join haughty Quebeckers and hippies from Vancouver in screwing over the oil sands. Those protestors need new signs to decry the same old pipeline under new public ownership. And the anti-Trudeau Albertans must face the fact that Trudeau is willing to take a massive financial and political stake in a bitumen pipeline’s success, and bringing along with it tax dollars of every Quebecker, British Columbian and all the rest of us.\\nConservative critics liked to point to Trudeau policies like a federal carbon tax and tougher environmental assessments as a reprise of his father’s Alberta-harming National Energy Program (NEP, still the dirtiest acronym in much of Alberta). But to recall a bigger pro-oil-sands plum than this, you’d have to reach back before the Harper government and its “energy superpower” boosterism to 1996 and another Liberal prime minister: Jean Chretien, and his massive tax-deduction program for oil sands mining that begat the Fort McMurray boom and two decades worth of multibillion-dollar megaprojects.\\nIt also helped secure a period of collegiality between Chretien and then-premier Ralph Klein (punctuated, albeit, by the sort of sniping Alberta conservatives are constitutionally bound to direct towards Liberal Ottawa). And if Alberta’s current premier was already cultivating chumminess with Justin Trudeau, both echoing the economy-plus-environment rhetoric on carbon policy, the love blossomed on Tuesday. Notley seized upon the Trans Mountain buyout as occasion for an outdoor celebration with her governing NDP caucus. “We said we would get the pipeline built, and we are getting it built,” Notley told reporters, as her elected human backdrop applauded and hooted. She acknowledged there were more challenges ahead, but added: “In the meantime, to all Albertans: pick up those tools, folks. We have a pipeline to get built.”\\nIn the head offices of Calgary oil companies, there was some relief that Kinder Morgan’s weak stomach for the political, legal and regulatory challenges of modern pipeline-building didn’t make this the third coast-bound oil conduit to die in three years, after Enbridge’s Northern Gateway in 2016 and TransCanada’s Energy East last year. But that was tempered with the shock that it took the promise of full project nationalization to resuscitate Trans Mountain’s expansion, as well as some awkward acknowledgement that, come August, oil companies would likely be paying their tolls on the existing Trans Mountain pipeline to a Crown corporation. Not since the earlier days of Petro-Canada (started under Pierre Trudeau) has a federal entity stampeded into the oil patch.\\nWhile Notley said this would provide Trans Mountain the certainty it needed to go forward, her declaration could have used a bundle of asterisks and footnotes. A federal loan to Kinder Morgan will kickstart construction shortly, but it’s still unclear how Ottawa and authorities will deal with protests and civil disobedience in Greater Vancouver, and the pockets of fierce Indigenous resistance along the route. A decision also looms from the Federal Court of Appeal on six First Nations groups’ bid to quash Ottawa’s project approval on the basis of inadequate Indigenous consultation, as well as the B.C. NDP government’s iffy legal query about its ability to restrict bitumen flow into the province. Kinder Morgan wasn’t sure how far Ottawa would go to deal with any setbacks the courts or activists might deal it. It’s now up to Ottawa to act decisively to protect its own large investment and ensure there’s a confident buyer on the other side of this bailout.\\nAlberta, meanwhile, is offering a secondary backstop to Trudeau’s backstop. While details are murky, the province would cover up to $2 billion more in pipeline construction costs should they escalate beyond a unspecified federal comfort level. In return, Alberta would take a piece of Ottawa’s ownership share. This means that while Canadians each get a $121 share in Trans Mountain, every Albertan could be in for an extra $467.\\nThere were dark jokes shortly after the New Democrats won election in this Conservatopia, that they’d start nationalizing industry. It was a long, weird, winding road to this joint venture with a Trudeau, and nobody’s clear where this goes next. Neither the NDP premier nor Liberal PM will be hailed as heroes for their dramatic intervention. But at least they avoid becoming scapegoats or villains. That’s a decent victory for them in these weird days in Alberta.\\nMORE ABOUT TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPELINE:', 'source_domain': 'macleans.ca', 'url': 'https://macleans.ca/news/canada/in-alberta-trans-mountain-is-the-countrys-great-nationalization-project/'}\n",

You all represent countries and companies that span the globe, and thank you for being here for the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit, and welcome to Montréal. Yes, I’m in my hometown, so I’m going to be testing some of your high school French throughout, but there is translation available for those of you who need it.\\nMany of you joined us in another great Canadian city, Toronto, just last month, for the 2018 Fortune Global Forum. I’m glad to see that you were so impressed that you decided to come right back to Canada. Because it does make sense to gather the world’s business leaders here. After all, we have a pretty great investment climate at the moment. In fact, I’d argue that the Canadian advantage for companies and workers is stronger than it’s ever been.\\nOur economy is performing among the best of G7 countries. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 40 years. And today, 600,000 more Canadians have a job compared to only two years ago. Exports are at record levels.\\nAnd importantly, we’re the only G7 country with preferential access to European, Asia Pacific, and North American markets. Simply put, we’re the only G7 country with a free trade agreement with every other G7 country. So Canada now has preferred market access to two thirds of the global economy.\\nNeedless to say, it’s a great time to be doing business in Canada, whether you’re expanding into new markets, scouting a location for your latest manufacturing plant, or searching for a new corporate HQ.\\nNow, I’m really looking forward to my discussion with Nina, but before we get into it, I want to briefly tell you about two exciting new policies we’ve recently put forward as a government, policies that will position us for the future, growing our economy, and providing good jobs and stability for our people. I’m talking about putting a price on pollution, and pay equity.\\nStarting with our planet, maybe you’ve seen the latest UN report. It basically says that we have twelve years to address climate change, or else face devastating consequences. Well, here in Canada, we’ve implemented a whole host of initiatives over the past few years to protect our oceans, phase out coal, invest in public transit, and conserve our national parks. And, as a crucial cornerstone piece of this larger plan, I announced a few weeks ago that we’ll be putting a price on the pollution that causes climate change. The problem we face as a country and really, as a world, is this: It’s free to pollute, and so we have too much pollution.\\nWilliam Nordhaus has spent his life studying the economic impacts of climate change. He concluded that the best way to reduce emissions is to put a price on pollution and encourage people to pollute less. This approach would also contribute to growing the economy, because businesses would be motivated to innovate, create new technologies and imagine the jobs of the future. And indeed, Mr. Nordhaus recently received the Nobel Prize in economics for his efforts and his work in this field.\\nIn Canada, we know that inaction is no longer an option. Climate change is a huge global threat, but the opportunities are immense for the companies and countries that choose to lead in this new economy. I’ve been known to say, a time or two, that the environment and the economy can, and must, go hand in hand. What’s good for the economy and what’s good for the environment are in this new era very often the same things. For companies that want to reduce their carbon footprint and position themselves as cutting edge economic leaders for this generation and the next, Canada is your natural and enthusiastic partner. Just ask Shell, Petronas, Petro Canada, Petro China, Mitsubishi, and COGAS, who last month announced a $40 billion liquid natural gas project in Canada, the single largest private sector investment in our country’s history.\\nMy friends, showing leadership on climate change is profitable, does create jobs, and is quickly becoming the key to success in this world.\\nNow, another area that requires serious leadership by the people in this room and by governments around the world, is pay equity. Equal pay for work of equal value. That’s a concept that’s pretty hard to disagree with. You know it and I know it: real action on pay equity is long, long overdue. When I was in Davos for the World Economic Forum last January, I talked about pay equity as a fundamental piece in the economic empowerment of women. And not just because it’s the right thing to do, it’s also the smart thing to do. In Canada, greater gender equality in the workforce could add $150 billion to our economy over the next decade. That’s an enormous opportunity that we will not let pass us by. And I’m proud to say that just last week, to take concrete steps to address the gender wage gap, our government introduced historic federal pay equity legislation.\\nThis, coupled with other key investments in things like childcare and parental leave, as well as our recently launched women entrepreneurship strategy, will make a huge difference. Not just for Canadian working women, but for our economic success as well.\\nNow, inequality in the workforce isn’t new. I’m sure that many of you, over the course of your impressive careers, have had to fight for the pay, the work environment and the recognition that you deserve. You know it now, and you knew it then; having your work undervalued, being underpaid simply because you are a woman is unacceptable. Making real, important change is difficult. It takes courage, and it takes leadership to do big things, but I know that this room is up to lead the challenge. Many of you have already addressed the gender wage gap with your own corporate advocacy and policies. For that, I thank you, and I vow to work with you in the months and years ahead, to get better results for women everywhere.\\nThe Most Powerful Women Summit, organized by Fortune, creates … plays an important role in encouraging progress in this area and to developing a work plan not just for women, but for workplaces and entire communities. Once again, thank you for being in Montréal. I know that many of you have travelled a long way to be here, and we are happy to have you with us today.\\nThank you all for coming from such a long distance away, for many of you, to be here in my hometown, in Montréal, tonight. I’m impatient to actually get chatting with Nina, so for now, we’ll pass to the next section. Thank you very much. Thank you.', 'source_domain': 'www.pm.gc.ca', 'url': 'http://www.pm.gc.ca/en/videos/2018/11/05/pm-trudeau-delivers-remarks-most-powerful-women-international-summit-gala'}\n",

Political parties are always thinking about how they can increase their seat count in the Commons.\\nThat is why Jack Layton and the NDP caucus voted with the Conservatives in the 2005 non-confidence vote that collapsed Paul Martin’s Liberal government even though the government had just set up a national day-care program, long on the New Democrats’ wish list.\\nIt is no accident that so much of this new 37-member cabinet is drawn from Quebec: 11 (30%), including Trudeau, vs four (11%) each from the Atlantic region and British Columbia.\\nWith no Liberals elected this time in Alberta or Saskatchewan, one might think there would be a few extra seats to spread around. Apparently not. This time there will be three fewer ministers from Atlantic Canada, one fewer from B.C. and one lone minister from the Prairies. Even Ontario, with 17 ministers, lost three spots in this cabinet.\\nThis is why Ginette Petitpas Taylor, former health minister from New Brunswick, and Kirstie Duncan, formerly minister of science, sport and persons with disabilities, were dumped from cabinet. Clearly, Trudeau is concentrating on developing as much presence in Quebec as possible before there’s a vote.\\nBefore this autumn’s campaign began, the Liberals were well on their way to winning a majority in the Commons because of support in Quebec. Had it not been for the Bloc Québécois coming back from the dead, the Liberals probably would have.\\nQuebec voters are notoriously fickle, building up a party in one election and tearing it down in the next. Just ask the NDP.\\nThe Liberals finished the election 13 seats shy of the 170 required for a majority. The Bloc gained 22 seats over the 10 it had going into the election. All the Liberals would have to do to get back to majority would be to take a chunk of that 22-seat gain — say, six or seven — with the balance coming from across the country.\\nThe Liberals are likely to engineer their own defeat in the Commons just as soon as they are confident they can gain back a majority. As a result, they will want to deliver on their election promises as quickly as possible. Watch for a 2020 federal budget loaded with Liberal election promises in March or April.\\nAs for the West, especially Alberta, the Liberals are likely to take the attitude that a draw is as good as a win — at least for now.\\nThe Liberals haven’t had an abundance of seats in Alberta for some time now. In fact, Alberta has been angry with Ottawa almost from the day the province joined Confederation in 1905. Saskatchewan isn’t any friendlier.\\nWinning back the West’s confidence is a long-term goal for the Liberals, just as it was for Trudeau the Elder almost 40 years ago. Pierre Trudeau cynically appointed Hazen Argue, a mediocre senator, to be the minister for the West.\\nThe younger Trudeau, to his credit, is approaching this problem with far more imagination than his father did. This time, Alberta-born Chrystia Freeland, the new unity minister from an Ontario riding, is leading a cabinet task force to restore the Liberal brand in the West, a work in progress for some time.\\nHistorically, the Liberals have been able to accomplish a great deal while in minority. Lester B. Pearson’s minority gave Canada medicare, the Canada Pension Plan and a new flag in the mid-’60s. Pierre Trudeau’s minority government of 1972-74 set up Petro-Canada and the Foreign Investment Review Agency.\\nOnce the Liberals announce the beginnings of pharmacare, accelerated climate change action and a secured pipeline, the party is likely to have enough political capital for an election.\\nKeep your eyes on Quebec.', 'source_domain': 'www.investmentexecutive.com', 'url': 'https://www.investmentexecutive.com/newspaper_/comment-insight/the-election-ready-cabinet/'}\n",

In Stephenville, Trudeau called the bilateral commitment to build a trans-Atlantic hydrogen supply chain by 2030 a historic moment, CBC reports.\\n“We must look to resources like hydrogen which can and will be clean and renewable. We can be the reliable supplier of clean energy a net-zero world needs,” he said. “The need for clean energy is almost limitless, and that’s where Canada, and Atlantic Canada specifically, gets to step up. With our renewable resources, we have a huge advantage.”\\n“We believe that Atlantic Canada presents a huge opportunity for us, but also for Canada to contribute to a green energy transition,” Scholz said, adding that his country will be looking for 90 to 110 terawatt-hours of hydrogen by 2030. “Canada is a close and like-minded partner in the energy transition.”\\nThe coverage of Scholz’ visit pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the intense energy supply crisis confronting Germany as a result, as the context for a faster shift to renewables. “”We cannot as a world continue to rely on authoritarian countries that will weaponize energy policy as Russia is, that don’t concern themselves with environmental outcomes, or labour rights or even human rights,” Trudeau said.\\nYet “the joint declaration of intent makes clear the agreement is not legally binding and stipulates it will be up to Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources and Germany’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action to keep track of whether it’s making progress on its goals,” the Globe and Mail writes. “The Canadian-German agreement sets no targets for volumes of hydrogen produced and contains no commitments of new money to help commence exports to Europe by 2025.”\\nNatural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the volumes of product that Canada can export that quickly “are probably going to be modest,” acknowledging that the timeline is “very ambitious”. But that “reflects the fact that Germany sees how this can help them in their current context,” with an immediate need to break free of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.\\n“Part of this is being driven by the desire to displace Russian gas,” Wilkinson said.\\nBut behind the bid for clarity and speed on the green hydrogen deal, Scholz’ visit featured a sequence of mixed messages on whether Canada and Germany see a future for liquefied natural gas exports from Canada’s East Coast.\\nSince the beginning of Russia’s war, Canadian fossil fuel companies have been pushing hard to resurrect LNG export schemes that had already been rejected for economic or environmental reasons. Analysts and observers have been explaining for months that the projects wouldn’t go into production in time to address Germany’s immediate need, and the country’s commitment to rapid decarbonization would soon wipe out the demand that would justify a longer-term import/export deal.\\nWe believe that Atlantic Canada presents a huge opportunity for us, but also for Canada to contribute to a green energy transition. -German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\\nAs The Energy Mix reported last week, when the Canadian and German governments announced Scholz’ itinerary almost two weeks ago, neither the word “liquefied” nor the acronym “LNG” showed up in either official statement. Later news reports confirmed that LNG would not be on the agenda for the three days of deliberations.\\nBut none of that stopped Trudeau and Scholz from confusing matters when discussions went live.\\nAt a news conference in Montreal Monday, the two leaders “appeared to pour cold water on the idea of shipping Canadian natural gas to Europe,” with Trudeau pointing to the cost and complex logistics of shipping gas from Western Canada “to a still-unbuilt liquefaction terminal on the Atlantic coast,” CBC reports.\\n“One of the challenges around LNG is the amount of investment required to build infrastructure for that,” Trudeau said. “There has never been a strong business case because of the distance from the gas fields, because of the need to transport that gas over long distances before liquefaction.”\\nHe said Canada’s “best” contribution to the global gas market would be to ship product to Asia (which brings its own set of serious challenges), or via pipeline to the United States, freeing up supplies that Germany could more easily acquire from other exporters.\\nWhile Canada would be willing to ease regulatory hurdles for LNG exports, “there needs to be a business case,” Trudeau added. “It needs to make sense for Germany to be receiving LNG directly from the East Coast. Those are discussions that are ongoing right now between our ministers, between various companies, to see if indeed it makes sense.”\\nScholz agreed that any LNG deal would need a business case, “because if it’s too expensive, it will not fly.”\\nBut Trudeau still held open the possibility that LNG bound for Germany might be “doable”, with Scholz adding that Germany “would really like Canada to export more” gas to Europe.\\n“As Germany is moving away from Russian energy at warp speed, Canada is our partner of choice,” he said, during a German-Canadian economic conference in Toronto. “For now, this means increasing our LNG imports. We hope that Canadian LNG will play a major role in this.”\\n“We are creating the atmosphere for very direct talks between the business sectors of Canada and Germany [to see] if there is something which could be done now in this very crisis,” the German chancellor told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos. “But this is part of the follow-up between the businesspeople of the two countries.”\\nOne of the challenges around LNG is the amount of investment required to build infrastructure for that. -Prime Minister Justrin Trudeau\\nIn the fog of comments and counter-comments, it wasn’t immediately clear how seriously either leader was advocating for direct LNG trade between the two countries. “Asked if there had been developments making new Canadian LNG projects more likely since Monday, a government source with knowledge of the talks said there had been ‘no change’ and Scholz was ‘well aware of sort of the timeline that would be associated’ with new Canadian LNG,” Reuters wrote Tuesday.\\nAt the same time, with winter approaching and its own supplies in doubt, Germany “is quite keen for gas from just about anywhere,” the Reuters source added.\\nReaction from Canadian civil society reflected the layered message coming out of Scholz’ three-day visit.\\n“After months of discussions focussed on East Coast liquified natural gas (LNG), the visit results in a welcome shift in rhetoric and focus towards green hydrogen,” Climate Action Network-Canada said in a statement.\\n“At a moment when the Canadian fossil fuel industry has been intensifying its lobbying efforts and instrumentalizing the invasion of Ukraine to promote fossil fuel expansion, the Canada-Germany Hydrogen Alliance offers a glimpse of economic opportunity and job creation beyond oil and gas,” CAN-Rac added. “As Canada’s domestic ‘clean hydrogen’ strategy continues to blur the lines between renewable and fossil-based hydrogen, the Canadian government has the chance to learn from Germany’s clear categorization and focus on green hydrogen.”\\n“There’s something beautiful about wind power from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia blowing away petro-power in Europe,” added Greenpeace Canada Senior Energy Strategist Keith Stewart. “Fossil fuels are at the core of the current conflicts in Europe and around the world, whether they are paying for weapons or fueling climate disasters. So it is great they’re signing a deal proving renewable energy is the way forward, even though they can’t quite bring themselves to shut the door completely on LNG just yet.”\\nBut that opening still raised flags with some CAN-Rac member groups.\\n“While we are encouraged to see the new Canada-Germany agreement for production and export of green hydrogen, we are concerned that the door is being left open to blue hydrogen fuel,” said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence Canada. “Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil fuels, is not a clean fuel, and in fact may contribute just as much greenhouse gas emissions as burning gas, or even more. The world needs truly clean, renewable energy sources now.”\\n“We welcome the race toward a zero-emissions economy,” said Louise Comeau, director of climate change and energy solutions at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. “We need to run that race with fair rules of engagement for communities and companies,” and “liquefied natural gas is not a legitimate contestant in this race. It won’t cross the finishing line in time to help Germany or the planet.”\\nThis article is republished from The Energy Mix.

It was a vote of confidence in a country that recognizes the need to develop our energy in a way that truly takes the environment into account, and that works in meaningful partnership with Indigenous communities.”\\nB.C. Premier John Horgan said the project makes him very proud.\\n“It is truly a great day for B.C., it is certainly a great day for northern British Columbia,” Horgan said.\\nThe announcement couldn’t come at a better time for northern B.C., he said.\\n“For too long, whether it be the beetle kill in our forests, whether it be downturns in mineral and metal prices, we have struggled in northern B.C. to meet the challenges of growth to make sure that people can stay and live and work in their communities,” Horgan said.\\n‘Profound disappointment’\\nBut provincial Green party Leader Andrew Weaver called the announcement a “profound disappointment.”\\n“Adding such a massive new source of (greenhouse gases) means that the rest of our economy will have to make even more sacrifices to meet our climate targets. A significant portion of the LNG Canada investment will be spent on a plant manufactured overseas, with steel sourced from other countries,” he said in a statement.\\n“B.C. taxpayers will subsidize its power by paying rates twice as high and taking on the enormous public debt required to build Site C. There may be as little as 100 permanent jobs at LNG Canada. I believe we can create far more jobs in other industries that won’t drastically increase our emissions.”\\nHorgan’s minority NDP government only governs because of the support of the Green party.\\nHorgan defended his party’s support of LNG Canada saying in a statement that the project will be the world’s cleanest in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\\n‘History is unfolding before our eyes’\\nCrystal Smith, chief councillor of the Haisla Nation, became emotional at Tuesday morning’s announcement.\\n“On behalf of our entire nation, we extend our gratitude to Shell, Kogas, Petronas, PetroChina and Mitsubishi for the investment being made in Haisla territory,” she said.\\n“History is unfolding before our eyes… The time is now, it is our time to reignite the true strength of our culture, our language and our Haisla identities.”\\nWith files from The Canadian Press and CBC News', 'source_domain': 'www.rcinet.ca', 'url': 'https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2018/10/02/lng-canada-investment-ottawa-british-columbia-haisla-nation/'}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '2016-10-01 00:00:00', 'title': 'Foreign Investment In Canada', 'content': 'Foreign Investment In Canada: Past, Present, & Future\\nIntroduction\\nThe Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (\"ISEDC\") is responsible for the review and approval of non-cultural foreign investments in Canada. Though review of foreign investment had long been a feature of the Investment Canada Act (the \"ICA\") the former Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper (that governed from 2006 through to late 2015), chose to closely scrutinize its high-profile, politically controversial deals.\\nIn October 2015, Canadians elected Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party to a sweeping majority. In its first months in office, the Trudeau government emphasized its commitment to continued foreign investment, and to increasing the transparency of foreign investment reviews. However, it remains uncertain how the change in government will impact foreign investment reviews.\\nThis article outlines Canada\\'s foreign investment review regime, discusses the monetary thresholds related to reviews, and summarizes certain deals which have been approved, blocked, or abandoned in the past. It also considers what, if any, changes may be on the horizon in light of the new federal government.\\nOverview of Canada\\'s Foreign Investment Review Regime\\nForeign investors are generally subject to the provisions of the ICA, which can require a foreign investor to either file a notification with the federal government up to 30 days following implementation of a proposed investment, or to file an application for review prior to implementation.1\\nAccording to the Investment Canada Act — Annual Report 2015-16, in the year ended March 31, 2016, the Minister of the ISEDC received 626 notifications and 15 applications for review under the ICA, totalling $30.51 billion in asset value, all of which were approved.2Investments from the United States accounted for 60 percent of the total number of investments and totalled $19.86 billion in asset value. Investors from the European Union had the second highest share with 136 investments, totalling $7.41 billion in asset value.3\\nThe ICA Review Process\\nThe ICA applies to all acquisitions of control by a non-Canadian of a Canadian business and to the establishment of new Canadian businesses by non-Canadians . \"Canadian\" is defined as those who are: Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada, governments of Canada and their agencies, and Canadian controlled corporations, partnerships, trusts and joint ventures.\\n\"Non-Canadian\" is defined in the ICA as individuals, governments, government agencies or entities that are not Canadian. The ICA requires all non-Canadians seeking to acquire \"control\" of a Canadian business to file either a post-closing notification (\"Notification\") or, if the applicable monetary thresholds relating to the value of the Canadian business are met, a pre-closing application for review (\"Application\") with the Investment Review Division. Establishments of new Canadian businesses by non-Canadians are also subject to the ICA, but only a Notification is required. Investments that involve Canadian cultural businesses are dealt with somewhat differently under the ICA.\\nIf only a Notification is required for an investment, it must be filed within 30 days of the transaction\\'s closing (or establishment of the new Canadian business). Following receipt of a Notification, the Director of Investments may request additional information or will issue a receipt certifying the date on which the completed notice was received; following which, no further action is required.\\nAn Application is a much more extensive regulatory review process, and statutory waiting periods apply before the investment can be completed. The Minister has 45 days from the receipt of an Application to determine whether the proposed investment is \"likely to be of net benefit\" to Canada (\"Net Benefit Test\"). This period may be extended unilaterally by the Minister for 30 days and for additional periods upon agreement between the Minister and the investor. Foreign investments may also be subject to a separate national security review (\"National Security Test\") .\\nThresholds for Notification and Application — Net Benefit Test\\nThe ICA is co-administered by the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of ISEDC (formerly the Minister of Industry) (\"Minister\"). The Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for assessing investments in Canada\\'s cultural sector, while the Minister of ISEDC is responsible for assessing investments in all other sectors of the economy.\\nA non-cultural Canadian business being acquired by a private sector WTO investor is measured against an \"enterprise value\"4 threshold.\\nSubsections 14.1(1) and (2) of the ICA state the review threshold is $600 million in enterprise value for investments to directly acquire control of a Canadian business. This threshold will increase to $800 million in 2017; and to $1 billion in 2019. Starting January 1, 2021, and for subsequent years, the threshold level will adjust annually based on growth in nominal GDP.\\nGenerally, an \"asset-value\" threshold is used for acquisitions involving WTO investors that are State Owned Enterprises (\"SOEs\"), and non-WTO investors that are SOEs where the Canadian business that is the subject of the investment is, immediately prior to the implementation of the investment, \"controlled by a WTO investor\". The asset value threshold is annually revised to reflect the change in Canada\\'s nominal GDP, unlike private sector WTO investments, and is $375 million in 2016. This value is calculated with reference to the book value of assets as represented in a company\\'s most recent financial statements. This threshold is further described in section 3.1 of the Investment Canada Regulations5 (\"Regulations\").\\nA cultural business is defined in section 14.1(6) of the ICA6 for the purposes of the acquisition of control rules. For a review of a Canadian cultural business, the thresholds are $5 million in book value of assets for direct investments, and $50 million in book value of assets for indirect investments. For an indirect acquisition of a cultural business, where the value of the worldwide assets of the Canadian business exceeds 50 percent of the value of all assets acquired, the review threshold is $5 million in book value of assets. Indirect investments in a cultural business are reviewable on a post-closing basis.\\nNet Benefit Test — Will the Investment Produce a \"Net Benefit to Canada\"?\\nIf an investment exceeds the Application threshold, the Net Benefit Test becomes relevant. Under section 21 of the ICA, this analysis requires the Minister to consider an Application and any other relevant information or evidence to determine whether or not the investment \"is likely to be of net benefit to Canada\".7\\nIn making this determination, the Minister is required to consider the relevant factors listed in section 20 of the ICA.8\\nUnder the Net Benefit Test, the positive impacts of the investment need only outweigh the negative impacts in order for the investment to be approved. The decision is essentially one of ministerial discretion.\\nAlthough the Minister is required to make his or her determination within the initial prescribed 45-day period after the receipt of the completed Application, the Minister can, and often does, exercise his or her ability to extend the time for deliberation. According to the 2015-16 Annual Report, the average length of time required by the Minister to make a net benefit determination in 2015-16 was 71.5 days.9\\nIn 2007, Industry Canada released guidelines for state-owned enterprises wishing to invest in Canada (the \"SOE Guidelines\").10 The SOE Guidelines clarified the existing principles under the ICA and underscored that sound principles of corporate governance and commercial orientation would be considerations when reviewing proposed SOE investments under the ICA.\\nIt is important to note that even after an investment has been reviewed and has received \"net benefit\" approval, the investment will be subject to continued monitoring. An investor may also be required to give specific undertakings addressing concerns before receiving investment approval, and there can be penalties if these undertakings are not met; see Canada (Attorney General.) v. United States Steel Corporation and U.S. Steel Canada Inc.11\\nCase Studies of Net Benefit Test Reviews Under the Harper Government\\nPrior to 2008, over 1,600 transactions were reviewed and no transaction had ever been blocked applying the Net Benefit Test. However, since 2008, there have been a number of instances where high profile deals have been blocked (not including proposed investments that were withdrawn before the Minister reached a decision, or that involved cultural businesses). Examples of three transactions scrutinized under the Net Benefit Test are outlined below.12\\nAlliant Techsystems & MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.\\nIn early 2008 this deal became the first to be rejected under the Net Benefit Test (before the national security jurisdiction was enacted in early 2009). The $1.3 billion deal involved the proposed acquisition of MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates\\' geospatial division (including Canadarm, Dextre, and the Radarsat-2 satellite) to Minneapolis-based Alliant Techsystems, a major U.S. defence contractor. Media reports suggested that the decision was motivated by concern over losing control of Canadian space technology, including Radarsat 2\\'s ability to monitor threats to Canadian sovereignty, especially in the Arctic.13\\nBHP Billiton & Potash Saskatchewan\\nIn 2010, the Australian company BHP Billiton\\'s (\"BHP\") $40 billion hostile takeover bid for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (\"Potash\") was blocked . After an Application was submitted to the Minister, in November of 2010, the Minister announced that the bid failed to satisfy the Net Benefit Test pursuant to the ICA.14 Many had been critical of the proposed transaction, including the government of the Province of Saskatchewan which voiced strong objections.\\nCNOOC/Nexen Inc. & Petronas\\nIn 2012, the Harper government approved the widely publicized proposed acquisitions of Nexen Inc. by the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (\"CNOOC\"), and of Progress Energy Resources Corp by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (\"Petronas\"). In both instances, the proposed investments were found to have met the Net Benefit Test.\\nHowever, after the approval of these deals, the Harper government adopted a new policy: to grant approval for future similar transactions \"only in exceptional circumstances\".15 The government did not define what these \"exceptional circumstances\" would entail. The government also expressed its concern that \"a series of large-scale controlling transactions by foreign state-owned companies could rapidly transform Canadian natural resource industries. Prime Minister Harper stated at the time: \"when we say that Canada is open for business, we do not mean that Canada is for sale to foreign governments\".\"16\\nNational Security Test\\nIn addition to the Net Benefit Test, the ICA contains a standalone National Security Test, which subjects investments by non-Canadians to review by the Governor-in-Council (Federal Cabinet), if they are deemed to be injurious to national security. The National Security Test under the ICA is similar to the process of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (\"CFIUS\").\\nPart IV.1 of the ICA governs the National Security Test. The review is usually engaged once a Notification or Application for a net benefit review is submitted. However, any other investment that the Minister considers potentially injurious to national security may also be reviewed. The National Security Test has a broader scope and can capture and examine many more transactions than the net benefit review.\\nSection 25.1 of the ICA permits a review of non-Canadian investments that:\\nestablish a new Canadian business;\\nacquire control of a Canadian business per the criteria laid out under the net benefit review; or\\nestablish or acquire a business only partially located in Canada, as long as there is a \"place of operation\" in Canada and either employees or assets in Canada connected with the business\\'s operations.\\nNo financial threshold is required to be met, and a transaction of any size may be reviewed.\\nIf the Minister \"has reasonable grounds to believe\" that an investment could be injurious to national security, the Minister may notify the investor. This notification serves to pause the investment, if it has not yet been implemented, although the investment may still be reviewed post-implementation. If the Minister, independently or jointly with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, determines that a National Security Test is required, an order will be made and notice of the review will be sent.\\nWhat constitutes an investment that is injurious to national security is deliberately not defined in the ICA or Regulations in order to preserve the legislation\\'s flexibility. If the investment is not found to be injurious to national security, a notice will be sent indicating the conclusion of the review process. If the investment is found to pose a threat to national security, the Governor in Council may order any measure that is felt to be necessary to mitigate the risks, including those listed in section 25.4 of the ICA, such as; blocking the investment, requiring undertakings or imposing terms and conditions for the implementation, or requiring divestiture of the investment if it has already been made.\\nThe Minister has 45 days after the certified date of a Notification or an Application to notify the investor that an order for a National Security Test may be issued. The Minister may notify the investor up to 45 days after the transaction has closed that an order for a National Security Test may be issued.\\nA review under the National Security Test may last up to 200 days, inclusive of all of the interim review periods and the period during which the Governor-in-Council may take action with respect to the investment. This period might be extended even further if the investor and the Minister agree to an extension.\\nCase Studies of National Security Test Reviews Under the Harper Government\\nBetween 2009 and 2016, ISEDC recommended that the Governor-in-Council order eight National Security Tests of investments.17 Among the eight National Security Tests that were conducted, three resulted in directives not to implement the proposed investment, two resulted in orders that the non-Canadian investor divest control of the Canadian businesses; and two resulted in the authorization of the proposed investments subject to conditions to mitigate the associated national security concerns. Finally, one review resulted in the proposed investment being withdrawn prior to the issuance of a final order. Examples of three transactions scrutinized under the National Security Test are outlined below.\\nAccelero/Allstream\\nIn this case, Egyptian investment group Accelero Capital Holdings (\"Accelero\") applied to acquire Allstream, a business unit of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (\"MTS\"). Allstream was valued at $520 million at the time. The Minister pointed to \"unspecified national security concerns\" as the basis for rejecting the deal. The Minister did not specify what the security concerns may have been, but said: \"MTS Allstream operates a national fibre optic network that provides critical telecommunications services to businesses and governments, including the Government of Canada\".18 This was the first expressly disallowed deal under the National Security Test since the creation of the national security regime in 2009.\\nIn 2015, MTS\\'s assets were ultimately successfully sold to a non-Canadian investor, US-based Zayo Group Holdings Inc. (\"Zayo\"), for US$465 million in cash.\\nGFI/Forsys\\nAnother deal that raised issues of national security was George Forrest International\\'s (\"GFI\") $585 million bid to buy Forsys Metals Corp. (\"Forsys\").19 In 2011, Industry Canada (the predecessor to ISEDC) put the transaction on hold due to US suspicions that the Belgian buyers planned to sell Forsys\\' uranium to Iran. Allegedly, the Canadian government received information that linked GFI to ongoing discussions with Iranian officials and that those discussions may have been related to Iran\\'s efforts to acquire additional uranium ore.20 The deal ultimately fell apart because GFI reportedly missed several deadlines in transferring funds for the takeover, but it is unclear whether it was Industry Canada\\'s intervention that ultimately affected its outcome.21\\nBeida Jade Bird\\nAccording to media reports, a proposed investment by Chinese investor, Beida Jade Bird (which is affiliated with China\\'s Peking University), to establish a $30 million alarm manufacturing facility in Saint-Bruno de Montarville, Québec was rejected under the National Security Test. The proposed facility would have placed it near the Canadian Space Agency. The deal was reportedly blocked due to these proximity concerns. This was the first deal in Canada that was rejected due to the proximity of an existing or planned Canadian business to an important government facility. The US has also in the past blocked or reviewed sensitive foreign investments owing to their proximity to military bases, also citing national security concerns.22\\nThe Liberal Government\\'s Approach to Foreign Investment\\nIn the lead-up to the October 2015 election, many statements by the Liberal party reflected sentiments favouring a more open and transparent foreign investment policy.\\nIn April 2015, then-Liberal Finance Critic, Scott Brison, gave a speech to the Canadian Club of Toronto in which he emphasized that a Trudeau government would \"rebuild Canada-China relations that have been diminished by Mr. Harper\".23 Mr. Brison went on to state:\\nForeign investment including Chinese investment can help create jobs and growth in Canada. Mulroney, Chrétien, and Martin got that, and so does Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau was the first federal leader to endorse the CNOOC-Nexen deal, weeks before Mr. Harper announced federal approval, while muddying the waters, and creating uncertainty for future Chinese investments in Canada. He rejects Mr. Harper\\'s position of making Canada\\'s foreign investment rules deliberately opaque.\\nMr. Trudeau understands that ambiguous rules might make the Prime Minister\\'s political life a bit easier, but it comes at a cost. That cost is borne by Canadian businesses who are looking for investment, and Canadian workers who need jobs. Ambiguous rules post-CNOOC-Nexen have created a chill on Chinese investment. Chinese investors are as allergic to uncertainty as Canadian investors.\\n[…] With a small open economy dependent on trade and investment, Canada needs a Prime Minister who understands how important relationships are to the Canadian economy.\\nIn June 2015, Mr. Trudeau himself stated that \"in order to diversify and globalize our approach to trade and foreign investment, we need to do more to strengthen our ties with burgeoning global markets in Asia and Africa, in particular\".24\\nIt still remains unclear whether the Liberal government will propose changes to the ICA that would provide further clarity to the Net Benefit and National Security Tests which would result in more transparent rules and procedures.\\nThe statements and comments from the Trudeau government suggest that it will continue its strong history of supporting free trade and openness to foreign investment. In September 2016, Trudeau embarked on a trade mission to China, with the stated hope of creating a renewed investment relationship. In discussing the trip, Finance Minister Bill Morneau stated that Canada may consider relaxing its foreign investment rules, and that the government is open to reviewing the restrictions on the ability of SOEs to acquire Canadian oil assets.25\\nIt is clear that governments around the world are paying attention to what is visibly a trend toward economic protectionism.

      "{'authors': ['Mitchell Beer'], 'date': '2022-08-25 03:00:39', 'title': 'Mixed Messages on LNG as Canada, Germany Ink Green Hydrogen Deal', 'content': 'Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signed on to a highly-anticipated but non-binding “hydrogen alliance” during a ceremony Tuesday in Stephenville, Newfoundland, capping three days of meetings that delivered new momentum for green energy development but mixed messages on the two countries’ future interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) development.\\nOne observer said the two countries’ joint declaration of intent, which calls for green hydrogen shipments from Canada to Germany to begin in 2025, was likely the first global trade deal for renewable hydrogen or its more easily-transported derivative, green ammonia. In Stephenville, Trudeau called the bilateral commitment to build a trans-Atlantic hydrogen supply chain by 2030 a historic moment, CBC reports.\\n“We must look to resources like hydrogen which can and will be clean and renewable. We can be the reliable supplier of clean energy a net-zero world needs,” he said. “The need for clean energy is almost limitless, and that’s where Canada, and Atlantic Canada specifically, gets to step up. With our renewable resources, we have a huge advantage.”\\n“We believe that Atlantic Canada presents a huge opportunity for us, but also for Canada to contribute to a green energy transition,” Scholz said, adding that his country will be looking for 90 to 110 terawatt-hours of hydrogen by 2030. “Canada is a close and like-minded partner in the energy transition.”\\nThe coverage of Scholz’ visit pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the intense energy supply crisis confronting Germany as a result, as the context for a faster shift to renewables. “”We cannot as a world continue to rely on authoritarian countries that will weaponize energy policy as Russia is, that don’t concern themselves with environmental outcomes, or labour rights or even human rights,” Trudeau said.\\nYet “the joint declaration of intent makes clear the agreement is not legally binding and stipulates it will be up to Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources and Germany’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action to keep track of whether it’s making progress on its goals,” the Globe and Mail writes. “The Canadian-German agreement sets no targets for volumes of hydrogen produced and contains no commitments of new money to help commence exports to Europe by 2025.”\\nNatural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the volumes of product that Canada can export that quickly “are probably going to be modest,” acknowledging that the timeline is “very ambitious”. But that “reflects the fact that Germany sees how this can help them in their current context,” with an immediate need to break free of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible.\\n“Part of this is being driven by the desire to displace Russian gas,” Wilkinson said.\\nBut behind the bid for clarity and speed on the green hydrogen deal, Scholz’ visit featured a sequence of mixed messages on whether Canada and Germany see a future for liquefied natural gas exports from Canada’s East Coast.\\nSince the beginning of Russia’s war, Canadian fossils have been pushing hard to resurrect LNG export schemes that had already been rejected for economic or environmental reasons. Analysts and observers have been explaining for months that the projects wouldn’t go into production in time to address Germany’s immediate need, and the country’s commitment to rapid decarbonization would soon wipe out the demand that would justify a longer-term import/export deal.\\nAs The Energy Mix reported last week, when the Canadian and German governments announced Scholz’ itinerary almost two weeks ago, neither the word “liquefied” nor the acronym “LNG” showed up in either official statement. Later news reports confirmed that LNG would not be on the agenda for the three days of deliberations.\\nBut none of that stopped Trudeau and Scholz from confusing matters when discussions went live.\\nAt a news conference in Montreal Monday, the two leaders “appeared to pour cold water on the idea of shipping Canadian natural gas to Europe,” with Trudeau pointing to the cost and complex logistics of shipping gas from Western Canada “to a still-unbuilt liquefaction terminal on the Atlantic coast,” CBC reports.\\n“One of the challenges around LNG is the amount of investment required to build infrastructure for that,” Trudeau said. “There has never been a strong business case because of the distance from the gas fields, because of the need to transport that gas over long distances before liquefaction.”\\nHe said Canada’s “best” contribution to the global gas market would be to ship product to Asia (which brings its own set of serious challenges), or via pipeline to the United States, freeing up supplies that Germany could more easily acquire from other exporters.\\nWhile Canada would be willing to ease regulatory hurdles for LNG exports, “there needs to be a business case,” Trudeau added. “It needs to make sense for Germany to be receiving LNG directly from the East Coast. Those are discussions that are ongoing right now between our ministers, between various companies, to see if indeed it makes sense.”\\nScholz agreed that any LNG deal would need a business case, “because if it’s too expensive, it will not fly.”\\nBut Trudeau still held open the possibility that LNG bound for Germany might be “doable”, with Scholz adding that Germany “would really like Canada to export more” gas to Europe.\\n“As Germany is moving away from Russian energy at warp speed, Canada is our partner of choice,” he said, during a German-Canadian economic conference in Toronto. “For now, this means increasing our LNG imports. We hope that Canadian LNG will play a major role in this.”\\n“We are creating the atmosphere for very direct talks between the business sectors of Canada and Germany [to see] if there is something which could be done now in this very crisis,” the German chancellor told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos. “But this is part of the follow-up between the businesspeople of the two countries.”\\nIn the fog of comments and counter-comments, it wasn’t immediately clear how seriously either leader was advocating for direct LNG trade between the two countries. “Asked if there had been developments making new Canadian LNG projects more likely since Monday, a government source with knowledge of the talks said there had been ‘no change’ and Scholz was ‘well aware of sort of the timeline that would be associated’ with new Canadian LNG,” Reuters wrote Tuesday.\\nAt the same time, with winter approaching and its own supplies in doubt, Germany “is quite keen for gas from just about anywhere,” the Reuters source added.\\nReaction from Canadian civil society reflected the layered message coming out of Scholz’ three-day visit.\\n“After months of discussions focussed on East Coast liquified natural gas (LNG), the visit results in a welcome shift in rhetoric and focus towards green hydrogen,” Climate Action Network-Canada said in a statement.\\n“At a moment when the Canadian fossil fuel industry has been intensifying its lobbying efforts and instrumentalizing the invasion of Ukraine to promote fossil fuel expansion, the Canada-Germany Hydrogen Alliance offers a glimpse of economic opportunity and job creation beyond oil and gas,” CAN-Rac added. “As Canada’s domestic ‘clean hydrogen’ strategy continues to blur the lines between renewable and fossil-based hydrogen, the Canadian government has the chance to learn from Germany’s clear categorization and focus on green hydrogen.”\\n“There’s something beautiful about wind power from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia blowing away petro-power in Europe,” added Greenpeace Canada Senior Energy Strategist Keith Stewart. “Fossil fuels are at the core of the current conflicts in Europe and around the world, whether they are paying for weapons or fueling climate disasters. So it is great they’re signing a deal proving renewable energy is the way forward, even though they can’t quite bring themselves to shut the door completely on LNG just yet.”\\nBut that opening still raised flags with some CAN-Rac member groups.\\n“While we are encouraged to see the new Canada-Germany agreement for production and export of green hydrogen, we are concerned that the door is being left open to blue hydrogen fuel,” said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence Canada. “Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil fuels, is not a clean fuel, and in fact may contribute just as much greenhouse gas emissions as burning gas, or even more. The world needs truly clean, renewable energy sources now.”\\n“We welcome the race toward a zero-emissions economy,” said Louise Comeau, director of climate change and energy solutions at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. “We need to run that race with fair rules of engagement for communities and companies,” and “liquefied natural gas is not a legitimate contestant in this race. It won’t cross the finishing line in time to help Germany or the planet.”', 'source_domain': 'www.theenergymix.com', 'url': 'https://www.theenergymix.com/mixed-messages-on-lng-as-canada-germany-ink-green-hydrogen-deal/'}\n",

This is not about one person. This is about a commitment from the people of British Columbia, to our resources, and to do what we can to make life better for British Columbia.”\\nSpecial credit was also given to the Haisla First Nation for its strong support for the LNG industry.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The People’s Pipeline', 'content': 'Photo by SumOfUs\\nIn an era of neoliberal privatization when governments the world over are hastening to sell off state owned assets and public services for a mess of pottage, Justin Trudeau bucks the trend by ponying up $4.5 billion to buy the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline, with complete disregard for the resolute opposition by the B.C. government, many Indigenous groups, most environmentalists and thousands of citizens across the country deeply worried about the ecological impact and risks of both the pipeline expansion and the ensuing escalation of tanker traffic.\\nYou might think this was some unexpected throwback to a politics of economic nationalism of the kind Trudeau’s father embraced in the 1970s when the Liberals and the NDP teamed up to create Petro- Canada.\\nBut the actual motives look even sketchier. And the timing seems that much stranger in light of the Liberals’ decision to sink $35 billion into the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a scheme purportedly intended to attract private investors to big new revenue-generating (read user fees) infrastructure projects, but which looks to be laying the groundwork for the privatization, by the back door, of existing infrastructure from airports to hospitals. So why the missed beat in the rhythm with Kinder Morgan?\\nOne rationalization we can rule out is the Trudeau government’s cake-and-eat-it line that pipelines carrying diluted bitumen from what the Environmental Defence organization dubbed the most environmentally destructive project on Earth are vital to fund the fight against climate change. It’s reminiscent of Ronald Reagan building missiles for peace. In fact, as sustainable energy expert Mark Jaccard observed (Globe and Mail, February 20, 2018), Trudeau knows full well that spurring further development of the tar sands with pipeline expansions guarantees Canada’s failure to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Paris Accord.\\nBruce Livesey has speculated (The Guardian, May 31, 2018) that the Kinder Morgan pipeline purchase was designed to avert a lawsuit by Chinese corporations under the Investor State Arbitration clause of the Canada-China Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. Negotiated under Harper and ratified with the support of Trudeau’s Liberals, the treaty contained a promise to have a pipeline built from Alberta to B.C. Trudeau, Livesey suggests, is “desperate to keep China happy,” presumably due to his hopes of a Canada-China free trade agreement.\\nStill, the price of the pipeline combined with the cost of actually building it ($6.9 billion according to a Financial Post estimate) adds up to over $11 billion. That’s a hefty price tag for a safeguard against being sued, especially when you factor in the costs of cleaning up potentially devastating dilbit spills.\\nAnother explanation is that the pipeline purchase is the federal Liberals’ bid to placate Alberta and secure support for Ottawa’s carbon-pricing plan — a plan that Ottawa recently downgraded to appease industry. No doubt Rachel Notley wants the pipeline expansion built; her political future likely depends on it. But does the fate of an NDP Premier weigh that heavily on the will of the Trudeau Liberals, even at the risk of alienating BC Premier Horgan?\\nOf course, the Trudeau government’s stated intention, on the “if you build it they will come” logic, is to land private investors. Possible takers range from an Indigenous consortium to Kinder Morgan itself – the latter having kindly been relieved of risk by Canadian taxpayers as a result of the government’s decision to indemnify buyers against any losses incurred due to determined and persistent resistance to the project, doubtless including the many legal challenges, like those brought by a number of Indigenous communities on the grounds that they have neither consented to the Trans Mountain expansion nor been meaningfully consulted.\\nSo the question remains cui bono? Not the taxpayers liable for billions in possible losses. Not the Indigenous nations whose land and water stand to be irreparably despoiled by a serious spill. Not B.C. coastal residents. Not menaced marine life. Not construction workers who will gain only a few thousand (mainly temporary) jobs, contrary to the inflated figures originally floated. Not even the Canadian economy in the long run since, as Howard Mann and Aaron Cosbey aptly argue (ipolitics.ca, April 15, 2018), excessive dependence on fossil fuel exports is ultimately a doomed proposition.

I mean, we all know that nowadays all federal parties are lousy with neoliberals who unjustifiably disdain the ability of governments to do things better than profit-motivated private corporations – despite plenty of evidence that this is so. Not only that, but many of us are so propagandized by the relentlessly peddled fantasies of market fundamentalism that the idea of a nation taking on a task of national importance makes us feel hinky.\\nNotwithstanding all that, Ottawa’s new point man on the project, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, seems to be in an indecent hurry to dump the pipeline project, for which we Canadians have just paid Texas-based Kinder-Morgan Inc. $4.5 billion.\\nIf the former Edmonton city councillor appointed to his new federal cabinet post by Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month succeeds with that objective, I’m sorry to have to advise you, we’re all almost certainly going to take a bath, metaphorically speaking.\\nWhen government spokespeople say they have no interest in hanging onto the thing, even if it’s the government that ends up spending the additional $7-billion plus to complete the expansion project, sharp corporate buyers are bound to smell the blood in the water.\\nSo it’s said here it’s time for Mr. Sohi and his fellow Liberals to take a breath and leave the pipeline where it belongs, under direct public ownership, or at least as a Crown corporation, as befits a major national public works program of strategic importance to the national economy.\\nThose of you conditioned to assume this is crazy need to take a breath too. Back in February when I first wrote public ownership was the only way to square the circle of massive opposition to the project on the West Coast and the elite consensus in Edmonton and Ottawa that it must be built, even insiders within Alberta’s NDP government thought I was, if not completely nuts, certainly going over the top for rhetorical effect.\\nSo they’ve told me. And yet here we are!\\nNothing fundamental has changed since I wrote “if an expanded pipeline capable of carrying diluted bitumen from north central Alberta to the West Coast is essential to the health of the national economy, and the survival of Alberta’s, then the federal government should build it and run it.”\\nI argued then that would, or at least could:\\nReassure both British Columbians and Albertans, including Indigenous peoples, regardless of their points of view on the specifics of the project.\\nEnsure meaningful financial and environmental accountability, impossible with a commercial corporation.\\nProtect good jobs, with fair wages, and adequate staffing to protect the environment along the way and on the coast.\\nHolistically include environmental and coastal protections in the overall scope of the project without the temptation to cut safety corners to pad the bottom line.\\nRestore to our national government partial influence over an essential industry it lost when it foolishly privatized Petro-Canada.\\nReassure Canadians outside Alberta this isn’t just a boondoggle to enrich a few well-placed corporate bosses in other countries.\\nPossibly even ensure our oil sands activities did not trash our climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and international climate change measures yet to come.\\nPlus, if those wonderful predictions about the “Asian premium” are true, it will make money for us all.\\nAnd without a doubt, handing the pipeline back to the private sector will re-energize the West Coast environmental movement to redouble its efforts to stop the pipeline.\\nThat’s because for-profit corporations are simply not capable of putting the needs of Canadians and Canada’s environment before short-term profit.

Trudeau’s Canadian Honeymoon Is About to End Imminent decisions on giant energy projects are sure to anger some parts of the electorate that swept him to power.\\nAlong Canada’s evergreen-draped west coast, the fate of a multi-billion-dollar energy project and a nation’s reconciliation with its dark, colonial past hang in the balance.\\nBeating rawhide drums and singing hymns, occupiers of Lelu Island—where Malaysia’s state oil company plans a $28 billion liquefied natural gas project—assert indigenous claims to the area where trees bear the markings of their forefathers and waters run rich with crimson salmon they fear the project will obliterate.\\n“The blood of my ancestors is on my hands if I don’t defend this land,” says Donald Wesley, 59, a hereditary chief of the Gitwilgyoots tribe which has inhabited the area for more than 6,000 years.\\nAnti-pipeline signs in the Haida Nation village of Old Massett in British Columbia. Photographer: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg\\nThat claim is about to test Justin Trudeau, the country’s telegenic 44-year-old prime minister, who swept to power a year ago vowing to be many things to many people—to tackle climate change, revive the economy, and reset Canada’s fraught relationship with its indigenous communities. Those pledges are set for collision in British Columbia—home to more First Nations communities than any other province and the crucible where a resource economy seeks to reinvent itself.\\nTrudeau has promised to decide on the LNG project on Lelu Island by Oct. 2. He has big spending plans to spur growth in a commodities downturn, and B.C., the birthplace of Greenpeace, is where most energy projects able to support that growth are located. Indigenous groups, essential to public support, are divided, with some seeking to preserve their habitat and traditions, and others arguing that the projects offer a path out of poverty, addiction and suicide.\\nFacing five major energy initiatives in B.C., Trudeau will choose which constituency to abandon. He’s allowed a hydroelectric dam to proceed; pending are decisions on Enbridge Inc.’s Northern Gateway crude pipeline, Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s LNG project on Lelu Island, a pipeline expansion by Kinder Morgan Inc., as well as a ban on crude oil tankers. He’s said to want at least one pipeline, and favor Kinder Morgan.\\nTrudeau says regularly it’s a prime minister’s job to get the country’s resources to market, and a pipeline approval would demonstrate Canada can get major projects completed as warnings mount that the complex web of regulatory rules is spurring a flight of capital.\\nAlberta’s oil sands, the world’s third-largest proven oil reserve, are landlocked. It leaves the country excluded from Asian markets and selling nearly all its crude to the U.S. at a discount. Environmental opposition has mired pipeline proposals in years-long delays.\\nThe closest path to the ocean from Alberta is west, through B.C. and its fractured indigenous communities. The port of Prince Rupert, B.C.—North America’s closest port to Asia capable of handling bulk commodities—sits at the epicenter of the contentious energy projects.\\nEllis Ross, chief councilor of the Haisla Nation, in Kitimat Village. Photographer: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg\\n“Those who oppose these projects don’t understand the potential that’s in front of them right now,” says Ellis Ross, the elected chief councilor of the Haisla First Nation, which has supported LNG projects.\\nYet the timing couldn’t be worse. While the province has received more than 20 LNG proposals in recent years, not a single one has taken off amid regulatory delays and a global glut. In July, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and its partners delayed a final investment decision on their C$40 billion ($30.3 billion) LNG Canada project. Chevron Corp.-led Kitimat LNG has slowed spending on another project nearby.\\nThere are 617 First Nation communities as well as Metis and Inuit populations for a total of 1.4 million indigenous people in Canada. Trudeau has committed to a “nation-to-nation” relationship, which is a pledge to treat the communities as quasi-states.\\nSome live on land governed by treaties, others on territories never ceded to the Canadian government. The communities have a range of legal rights that courts have spent years sorting through, in particular around energy projects. B.C. is especially fraught, with 49 ongoing treaty disputes. One signal of the uncertainty is TransCanada Corp.’s proposed Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast, which seeks to cross five other provinces and 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) rather than navigate roughly 1,200 kilometers through B.C.’s legal minefields.\\nHaida artist Jim Hart works on carving a totem pole in Old Massett in the Haida Gwaii archipelago. Photographer: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg\\nIndigenous communities generally share grim realities—a remote location, acute housing shortages, soaring unemployment, high food costs, high addiction rates, poor health services and poor schools. Youth suicide rates are more than five times the national average. A 2014 United Nations report said the situation had reached crisis proportions.\\nThe issue is close to Trudeau’s heart. His family was ceremonially adopted by the Haida Nation during a 1976 visit to the fabled island community—Trudeau was a child, his father was prime minister—that’s now become ground zero for the tanker ban. The late Pierre Trudeau constitutionally enshrined indigenous rights. The prime minister, who has a Haida raven tattooed on his left shoulder, wrote to each member of his cabinet that “no relationship is more important to me and to Canada than the one with indigenous peoples.”\\nHe appointed the country’s first indigenous minister of justice and attorney general, Jody Wilson-Raybould, a B.C. lawyer and former First Nations regional chief. She previously campaigned against oil sands projects. She’s now silent on the matter—she declined multiple requests for a statement or interview about her position on the Enbridge and Kinder Morgan pipelines. Environment Minister Catherine McKenna said the government’s revised environmental rules boosted indigenous consultation. “Clearly this is a challenging area, but we are serious in our commitment,” she said.\\nThere is a broader political issue. Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and others have threatened legal action. The city’s economy is based on a green reputation, he argues. The number of Trudeau lawmakers from the Vancouver region exceeds the margin by which he holds a parliamentary majority.\\nPeter Lantin, president of the Council of the Haida Nation, in Old Massett. Photographer: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg\\nThe indigenous element looms largest, though, and Trudeau confronts fractured communities whose hereditary chiefs and recently elected leaders often spar over what’s best for their futures and who ultimately has authority. Those schisms arise from policies over decades that Trudeau has pledged to fix.\\n“People like to simplify it as development versus no development or economy versus no economy,” said Peter Lantin, the elected president of Council of the Haida Nation. “We’re trying to sort these things out as a nation.”\\nLast month, the Haida stripped two hereditary chiefs of their titles for supporting an oil pipeline project—a move with no precedent in the oral history of a group with 13,000-year roots on the island, said Darin Swanson, hereditary chief of the Yagu Laanas clan, who had overseen the 10-hour ceremony.\\nDressed in a raven’s tail blanket, sea otter pelts and a feathered headdress, Swanson had intoned the responsibilities etched into a copper shield of a community chief as he compared energy companies’ financial incentives to European colonialists who had brought diseases that decimated native communities.\\nThe prospect of cash payouts from the projects can splinter communities where land is owned communally and fish is still a currency for bartering. Murray Smith, a Gitwilgyoots tribal leader, has never sung the national anthem. He was almost inspired to when he voted for Trudeau, wooed by his environmental pledges. “This is the test. If he decides against LNG, I’ll sing ’O Canada,’” he said.\\nA freighter ship moored in the port of Prince Rupert. Photographer: Ben Nelms/Bloomberg\\nIt leaves Trudeau jammed between growing impatience, high expectations and sluggish economic growth. He’s also overhauling environmental review rules and pushing for a carbon price, all while the clock is ticking—former Alberta Premier Jim Prentice, who spent much of his career on indigenous and energy issues, warns capital is simply leaving Canada’s energy sector and “that really should alarm us.”\\nMeanwhile, Trudeau’s C$8.4 billion in new indigenous spending announced this year is rolling out slowly, frustrating Perry Bellegarde, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations and Canada’s de facto top-ranking indigenous political leader. Disillusionment is brewing among indigenous Canadians, Bellegarde says.\\n“It’s going into a year now of his mandate, and we want to see things on the ground,” he said.\", 'source_domain': 'www.bloomberg.com', 'url': 'https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-trudeau-energy/'}\n",

Canadian oil and gas is discounted because it can’t reach markets outside the U.S., which is saturated with its own production. CNOOC, which became China’s biggest spender in Canada with the 2009 acquisition of oil and gas producer Nexen Inc. for $15.1-billion, has proposed to build the Aurora LNG project near Prince Rupert, B.C., but Chen is not optimistic it will get off the ground any time soon. “The federal government (in Canada) is a weak government, not like China in comparison,” he said. “Most resources are located only in Alberta … and Alberta is an inland state, they can only transport to the U.S. You go to Pacific, you have to negotiate with B.C. and B.C. has a lot of First Nations.

The comments come as Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, hopes to rebrand Canada as more than a petro-state and to invite new investment this week in Davos, where the world’s business and political elites are meeting for the World Economic Forum. Chinese companies were also invited by the federal and various provincial governments to invest in Canada, when its energy abundance was the flavor of the day. Chen said there is regret in some Chinese quarters about the Canadian investment spree and it’s unlikely to be repeated. Private Chinese investors who are still enthusiastic about North American energy are pouring their cash into the U.S., which has successfully transformed itself from a large energy consumer into an energy exporter, he said.

It began well before Xi’s Ministry of State Security kidnapped and imprisoned the diplomat-on-leave Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor in December, 2018, to punish Canada for having detained one of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite untouchables on a U.S. extradition request. While the Michaels were being held incommunicado in Chinese prison cells, the Huawei Technologies Company chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was in the media spotlight, enjoying a lavish lifestyle in one of her Vancouver mansions while her case proceeded through the courts. It’s only now, after all this time, that Meng is availing herself of a kind of plea bargain with the U.S. Justice Department — an option that has been available to her all along.\\nArticle content Friday night, she and both Spavor and Kovrig were on their way home, but the underlying concerns remain. No matter how far the “relationship” drags Canada away from its traditional allies and Five Eyes intelligence partners, Ottawa’s singular focus has been on avoiding hard questions, keeping quiet and hoping nobody notices. While Beijing’s ratings in Canadian public opinion polls have continued to plummet year after year, the Trudeau government’s main worry hasn’t been about the outrages against international norms that were causing Canadians to take such a dim view of the Xi regime. Its main worry was that Beijing’s behaviour was harming the “relationship.”\\nAdvertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content It’s confounding, but it’s got nothing to do with avoiding any indiscretion that could complicate the delicate negotiations surrounding the release of the Canadians that Beijing has been holding hostage. A lot of it has to do with the influences of the Liberal party’s old guard and its close and lucrative ties to corporate interests that are deeply invested in trade relations with China. But it’s mainly about a whole-of-government organizing principle that Trudeau decided to stake his reputation on a decade ago, a big idea about the Canadian economy, foreign policy and global trade. After everything that has happened since then that has proved the idea’s catastrophic folly, Trudeau has never taken pains to reverse its course. It was a full year before the two Michaels were picked up in China that Trudeau was dismissed from Beijing like an amorous suitor with rather too high an opinion of his prospects. Trudeau and his entourage arrived in China in December 2017, in a whirlwind of excitement about formalizing an engagement for an eventual exchange of vows in a free trade agreement. Trudeau had come fully expecting that the arrangement should reflect his “progressive” agenda. He was rebuffed, and Trudeau’s Chinese hosts sent him away.\\nPlatformed This newsletter tackles hot topics with boldness, verve and wit.

It goes back a decade, and to be fair, what Trudeau and his closest advisers launched back then was like one of those massive, deep-hulled container ships — not the kind of thing, to borrow a phrase, that you can just “turn on a dime.” That ship left port a long time ago. It’s been barrelling across the sea ever since. The inflection point in Canada’s subjugation by Beijing came within a week of Nov. 14, 2012, the official start of the race to succeed Michael Ignatieff as Liberal leader. The year before, Prime Minister Stephen Harper had won his first Conservative majority government and the NDP’s Jack Layton was the official Opposition leader. With the Liberals left in third place in the House of Commons, Trudeau joined the race for the party leadership and invested his credibility in a big idea: China is the future. While Harper’s vision was to establish Canada as a “global energy superpower,” which would shift the centre of Canada’s political gravity westward, Trudeau’s was just as straightforward: Beijing’s promise of a win-win relationship would unlock untold riches for Canada’s middle class. The power would not shift westward, but would rather entrench itself in the Liberal party’s bastions within the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto triangle.\\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Armed with growth forecasts and statistical projections helpfully provided by McKinsey & Company — the global consulting firm whose managing director, Dominic Barton, would go on to play a more public role later in the drama — Trudeau laid out his case in a widely published manifesto within days of declaring his candidacy. “China is scanning the world for acquisitions like a shopper in a grocery store,” Trudeau wrote. “Just a decade ago, China’s outward foreign direct investment was negligible; today it approaches $100 billion. Canada has perhaps more potential to capitalize on this context than any other country. From minerals to energy, from education expertise to construction, we have a lot of what China needs.” Photo by Peter McCabe/THE GAZETTE This was supposed to distinguish Trudeau in the field of Liberal leadership candidates. He was determined to be seen as something more than just an unserious and cossetted high-society grandee, and his big China idea was the way to do it. The idea buttressed the sanctity around the legacy of his father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who had been so beguiled by Mao Zedong that he went on to play a key role in the normalization of the People’s Republic of China in the international community.\\nAdvertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Trudeau the elder was remembered fondly and appreciatively in the salons of China’s Communist party elites, so if anyone was going to animate the symbiosis of the Canadian and Chinese economies and tap into all those markets and all that money, it would have to be Justin Trudeau. Explaining himself on CTV’s “Question Period” two weeks after his manifesto made the rounds, Trudeau said he trusted his own instincts, adding, “Obviously, my family has historical ties with China.” It helped, too, that the idea was already bred in the bone in his father’s circle — the old Liberal-dominated network of trade lobbyists and corporate deal-makers with ties to the Desmarais family’s Power Corporation. Jean Chrétien, the Liberal prime minister who led several “Team Canada” missions to China and played a critical role in rehabilitating the regime in the boardrooms of the world after its slaughter of students and pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square in 1989, had been busily plying the China trade ever since his resignation following the 2003 sponsorship scandal. Chrétien’s son-in-law, Andre Desmarais, is honorary chairman of the Canada-China Business Council (CCBC).\\nAdvertisement 7 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Even before he settled in at the Prime Minister’s Office after winning the Liberals a majority government in October 2015, Trudeau appointed Peter Harder, head of the CCBC, to lead his transition team. Trudeau later saw to it that Harder was given the Liberals’ top seat in the Senate. Former immigration minister John McCallum raised eyebrows by taking $73,000 in free trips to China before his appointment as ambassador to China. When McCallum ended up having to be relieved of his duties for issuing embarrassing declarations endorsing Meng’s legal complaints about her detention in Canada, he was replaced by McKinsey’s Dominic Barton, who had been so helpful in developing Trudeau’s China proposals in 2012. But even before he was appointed Canada’s ambassador to China, Barton was already occupying a top spot in the Liberal brain trust as chair of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s blue-chip advisory council on economic growth. Barton had spent years in China, where McKinsey had advised a company involved in the construction of illegal islands in the South China Sea, and drew unwanted attention to itself by holding a corporate retreat in Xinjiang, within walking distance of a Uyghur concentration camp.\\nAdvertisement 8 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Barton’s place in Morneau’s council was so central that the council itself was almost totally a McKinsey show. The council didn’t even have its own budget. McKinsey handled its administration, supplied consultants and provided all the research and analysis for free. Meanwhile, with Stéphane Dion as Trudeau’s foreign minister, the China enthusiasts began lobbying Global Affairs Canada, where senior officials were put to work making their dreams come true. Among their big ideas: Canada’s senior defence staff should be on a first-name basis with the generals in the People’s Liberation Army. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was established as a bulwark against China’s growing influence in the Asia Pacific region? Beijing should be invited to join. The Asia Infrastructure Development Bank that Beijing had assembled to build out its Belt and Road Initiative to displace the American-led rules-based world order? Canada should invest in it. And Canada did, to the tune of a pledge totalling nearly $1 billion. Sure, Canadians were jittery about all this, but what that meant was that Ottawa should devise methods so as to be “leading public opinion” on the virtues of the new Canada-China relationship.\\nAdvertisement 9 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content But back to that inflection point, the moment the compass heading on that lumbering bulk carrier of the Canadian state was set in the direction of China. A confluence of events around that time were harbingers of the turmoil to come. Opinion was sharply divided in Ottawa about what to make of China’s profligate offshore spending. On one side, the standpoint was well illustrated by a remark uttered by former Liberal cabinet minister Martin Cauchon, later a member of the board of the Canada China Business Council, in November 2011: “There is a saying that if you can’t beat them, join them.” Photo by JADE GAO/AFP That was how Cauchon welcomed the news that Huawei, Xi Jinping’s “national champion” telecommunications behemoth — with all its service to Xi’s globe-encircling power moves and its links to China’s military and intelligence services and its association with surveillance-state infrastructure put in place by tinpot Beijing-friendly authoritarian regimes — was ramping up its operations in and around Ottawa, aided by a $6.5-million Ontario government grant. There is another saying: “We’re sitting ducks.”\\nAdvertisement 10 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content That’s how Anthony Campbell, the former head of the Intelligence Assessment Secretariat of the Privy Council Office, described Canada’s position in 2012. What Campbell meant was that Beijing and its state-owned enterprises were sloshing so much money around, and the federal government was so inattentive to the implications, that nobody at the centre of power in Canada was capable of articulating what the words “national security” even meant anymore. To complicate the Harper government’s grand plan to transform Canada into a global energy superpower, Beijing’s state-owned energy corporations were suddenly buying up huge swathes of the Alberta oilpatch. And these weren’t bit players. Petro-China was bigger than ExxonMobil. Sinopec calculated its annual revenues to an amount that exceeded Canada’s haul in federal tax revenue. When the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) proposed to lavish $15.1 billion on the shareholders of Calgary’s Nexen Inc., to take over the company and its holdings in their entirety, what was in the pipe was the largest acquisition, the biggest overseas outlay of cash, in the history of the People’s Republic of China.\\nAdvertisement 11 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content The Conservative cabinet was divided. Harper had begun his time in the Prime Minister’s Office as a “China hawk,” to use the fashionably pejorative expression. But he soon learned that there was nothing to be gained from it. The business press hounded him whenever he opened his mouth about Tibet, or the Uyghurs, or the human rights of China’s 1.4 billion people. Running for the top Liberal job, Trudeau declared out of the blue that he supported CNOOC’s bid. The CNOOC-Nexen deal would be good for Canada, Trudeau explained, because Chinese investment would create “middle-class Canadian jobs.” It was also around that time, during U.S. President Barack Obama’s tenure in office, that the U.S. Justice Department started investigating Huawei Technologies Company, a Chinese firm that Canada had generously favoured, for fraud and sanctions-evasion in Iran. The Americans warned Ottawa: You’ll want to be careful of your blossoming relationship with Huawei. No good will come of it. But Ottawa wasn’t careful. And no good came of it. The only problem Trudeau saw was that Canadians had not been adequately instructed in the correctness of his standpoint on China. “Where is the leadership to explain to Canadians why this relationship is so important, to engage Canadians in the conversation, to make us aware of the opportunities?” he wrote.\\nAdvertisement 12 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Trudeau later attempted to meet what he saw as a need to make Canadians “aware of the opportunities” with a special project in aid of Beijing’s public-relations difficulties among ordinary Canadians. The Public Policy Forum brought together an array of Trudeau’s China enthusiasts in government, business and academia in what was to be a two-year exercise to make Canadians feel good about Trudeau’s big idea. It didn’t work. China’s standing continued to drop in the opinion polls, and it didn’t help that Ottawa allowed a shadowy Chinese corporation to spend $1 billion acquiring a network of nursing homes when the head of that same corporation was arrested by Chinese authorities on fraud charges. It didn’t help, either, when Ottawa unaccountably approved a Chinese acquisition of Norsat International, a firm with contracts to supply American military satellites. It also didn’t help that Trudeau’s way of doing business with China was to invite 61 Liberal donors to a state dinner with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Photo by ANDRE FORGET/QMI AGENCY Those other grubby cash-for-access soirees with Chinese billionaires didn’t help, either, especially after a pair of billionaires were found to have made lavish donations to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which spent some of their dubious money on a statue of the former prime minister at McGill University in Montreal.\\nAdvertisement 13 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content That’s the backdrop to the way Trudeau launched Canada into Beijing’s cold embrace. Don’t be afraid, Trudeau assured us. Beijing just does things a little differently is all. We should leave our antiquated 20th-century assumptions behind us. “China, for one, sets its own rules and will continue to do so because it can,” Trudeau wrote in 2012. “China has a game plan. There is nothing inherently sinister about that.” Harper ended up letting the CNOOC-Nexen deal go ahead, but made it clear that, going forward, only in an “exceptional circumstance” would a Chinese state-owned enterprise be permitted to bite off such a huge chunk of a vital Canadian industry. That last bit did not please Beijing at all. But after Trudeau was elected, Canada settled into a new groove, and Beijing was pleased. Ever since then, the growing public alarm over repeated warnings from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and from the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) about Beijing’s myriad threats to Canadian sovereignty and national security have only served to make Trudeau less verbose about the big ideas he has about China. There’s no indication that his ideas have changed at all.\\nAdvertisement 14 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Foreign Affairs minister François-Philippe Champagne kept promising some sort of new China policy, but it never came. Neither was there evidence of any new policy in Trudeau’s platform for the election campaign that just concluded — an election marred by evidence that China and its Canadian proxies engaged in a brutal disinformation campaign, targeting candidates who have shown some spine in confronting Beijing’s human rights abusers. This is exactly what CSIS and the CSE warned would happen. Canada remains alone among the Five Eyes security partners (Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom) in its silence about whether Huawei should be permitted to contribute to Canada’s 5G network. Ottawa has remained almost completely silent about a clear pattern of harassment and intimidation waged by Beijing’s proxies in Canada against human rights activists across the country — a pattern confirmed in public reports issued by CSIS. Even after Beijing began devouring Hong Kong in direct violation of the Sino-British handover agreement that was supposed to guarantee the island’s democratic autonomy after 1997, and even after incontrovertible evidence emerged about Xi’s genocidal persecution of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, the Trudeau government has given no indication that it has changed course on China. Even the arbitrary detentions of Michael Kovring and Michael Spavor were treated as unfortunate events, bumps along the road to deeper engagement with Xi’s police state.\\nAdvertisement 15 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content As Barton put it to the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations in February 2020, sure there are red lines, but “friends disagree with each other; friends get mad at each other, so we need to define where those are and make sure people understand them. We need to manage both these opportunities and challenges in concert.… We can engage and grow, and we can also be tough at the same time.” Rob Oliphant, in his role as parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, told the same committee in March that the kidnapping of Kovrig and Spavor couldn’t stop the world from turning. After all, “the well-being of specific Canadians in detention in China needs to be considered alongside the well-being of Canadian businesses doing important agricultural business and other business in Canada, and also the people-to-people relationships that we enjoy between Canada and China.” The Trudeau government’s commitment to deeper relationships with China is shared by fewer and fewer Canadians: a Nanos poll carried out in August showed that two-thirds of Canadians want Ottawa to take a harder line with China. An Angus Reid poll released in March showed that only one in 10 Canadians agrees that Canada should pursue closer trade ties with China.\\nAdvertisement 16 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\\nArticle content Last year, the all-party National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians reported that Canada’s intelligence agencies had concluded that Canada has become an “attractive and permissive target” for Beijing-directed influence operations that threaten Canada’s foundational institutions, “including our system of democracy itself.” None of this mattered. The Trudeau government has stubbornly resisted efforts by the House of Commons to discern how Chinese researchers who collaborated with People’s Liberation Army scientists from the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party managed to obtain high-level security clearances to undertake research at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. A cloud of suspicion was left hanging over all that when the House of Commons declared the Liberal government in contempt of Parliament for withholding unredacted documents about the firing of two scientists at the lab. The Trudeau government’s commitment to deeper relationships with China is shared by fewer and fewer Canadians. Terry Glavin And it’s still not clear why the Trudeau government entered into a vaccine-development agreement with China’s CanSino Biologics, or why it was still a secret, weeks afterwards, that Beijing had reneged on the deal and blocked shipments to Canada. There are a lot of things that remain unclear about the Trudeau government’s approach to China, except that the “relationship,” as it is called, requires submitting to abuse, hostage diplomacy, duplicity and humiliation at the feet of Xi Jinping.

Alberta placed ninth behind Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, and Louisiana.\\nNewfoundland and Labrador placed 14th on the list while British Columbia took the 15th spot.\\nThe survey of senior oil and gas executives, conducted between May and September of 2023, ranks 17 North American jurisdictions—13 in the U.S. and four in Canada—based on policies affecting oil and gas investment.\\n“The message from investors is clear—Canada’s onerous and uncertain regulatory environment continues to hurt the investment attractiveness of the country’s oil and gas industry,” study co-author Elmira Aliakbari, director of the Fraser Institute’s centre for natural resource studies, said in a news release\\nThe U.S. performed better than Canada in 13 of the 16 policy factors being considered by investors, the report found. Canada outperformed the U.S. when it comes to the quality of the geological database, security, and legal system.\\nThe U.S. had the edge over Canada when it came to fiscal terms such licensing and royalties, taxation, regulatory enforcement, cost of regulatory compliance, uncertainty concerning wilderness and archaeological protection, trade barriers, labour regulations and employment agreements, quality of infrastructure, labour availability and skills, disputed land claims, political stability and regulatory duplication and inconsistencies, and environmental regulations.\\nUsing various policy factors, the Fraser Institute assigned both countries a policy perception index (PPI) score. Canada’s median PPI score is 61, more than 13 points lower than the U.S.’s score of 74.6. The think tank said this discrepancy demonstrated that “the US has a competitive advantage over Canada in most policy areas.”\\nOne of the top issues, the report found, was “uncertainty” surrounding environmental regulations. This concern was cited among 100 percent of survey respondents regarding Newfoundland and Labrador, 93 percent for British Columbia, 50 percent for Alberta, and 29 percent for Saskatchewan, the report said.\\nThe U.S. fared better with only 6 percent of respondents deterred by environmental regulations for Oklahoma, 8 percent for Kansas, and 9 percent for North Dakota.\\n“Policies matter, and when investors are indicating they would rather invest in American states instead of several Canadian provinces, policymakers should take note,” Fraser Institute policy analyst Julio Mejia said in a news release. Impact of Carbon Pricing Many survey respondents also said that Canada’s carbon tax was a substantial deterrent to investment.\\n“Swiftly rising carbon costs coupled with uncertain solutions for practical carbon storage serve as obstacles to investment,” one respondent said when asked about investing in Canada.\\n“The possibility of revoking oil and gas licences following discovery is a major deterrent to investment,” another potential investor said.\\nAlberta was singled out by another industry executive who said the province’s “consistent policy changes and discrepancies in carbon regulations across government jurisdictions” remain an investment deterrent. British Columbia was also cited for its “carbon taxes, emission regulations, and abrupt regulatory shutdowns.”\\nLevied by the Liberal government in 2019, Canada’s carbon tax is the price placed on the carbon content of fuels to reduce CO2 emissions. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described the carbon tax as a necessity not only to foster greener thinking but to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\nCarbon pricing kicked off in 2019 at $20 per tonne and rose to $50 per tonne in 2022. The price will rise $15 per tonne every year until it eventually reaches $170 per tonne in 2030.\\nEnvironment Minister Steven Guilbeault has not guaranteed the current $170-per-tonne cap on the carbon tax after 2030, saying it’s “a decision that hasn’t been made” yet.\\nHow the tax is applied varies from province to province, but every jurisdiction must meet the minimum standards set out in the 2016 Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, and the 2018 Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA).\\nThe GGPPA places a minimum price on carbon emissions which the government refers to as its “carbon pricing backstop.” As long as Canada’s provinces and territories meet the minimum, they are allowed to run their own carbon pricing scheme.

It would phase out coal-fired generators in 15 years, cap oilsands emissions at a level allowing the industry to grow, and impose a carbon tax across Alberta’s economy.\\nNotley’s announcement came days before Canada’s leaders were to head to Paris to negotiate a new UN global agreement on climate change. When she climbed onto the Telus World of Science stage in Edmonton to unveil her plan, she had some critical information in her back pocket.\\nThat Notley could proceed with confidence had to do with a dinner that occurred in Ottawa just days after Justin Trudeau’s election victory in October. As Vancouver Sun reporter Peter O’Neil revealed, the party comprised three Alberta NDP insiders and an equal number of key figures in the new Trudeau government.\\nRepresenting Alberta were Brian Topp, Notley’s chief of staff; Richard Dicerni, head of the Alberta public service; and Andrew Leach, who was then putting the final touches on the climate plan. Sitting on the other side of the table were Trudeau’s top political operatives, Gerry Butts and Katie Telford, along with Privy Council clerk Janice Charette.\\nAfter they discussed Alberta’s miserable reputation on the international climate change front, it became clear that Trudeau would back Notley’s carbon tax and “take it national” in short order. And the national carbon tax would give Trudeau licence to approve pipelines that would expand Alberta’s oilsands production. Knowing that Trudeau had her back, Notley could proceed with her plan. The stars were aligning nationally and provincially: Trudeau and Notley could count on each other’s support during the carbon pricing and pipeline approval wars.\\nIt didn’t take long for events to unfold. Two weeks later, John Manley, head of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, gave Trudeau some advice on how to get serious about climate change. Writing in the online magazine iPolitics, Manley reminded Trudeau that the chief executives had been on record since 2007 about the need to put a price on carbon in order to erase uncertainty for corporate planners and investors.\\nManley then made two points: Trudeau had to demonstrate a commitment to “responsible” climate action and he needed to step up efforts to support the export of energy products. More pipelines please. And from the actions Manley said must be undertaken — don’t damage the competitiveness of Canadian companies, phase in carbon pricing gradually, use revenues raised primarily to cut corporate and personal income taxes — it’s clear the responsibility was to the financial well-being of Canadian companies and not to the future of the planet.\\nAnd that’s what Trudeau did over the next year, demonstrating a commitment to “responsible” climate action without damaging the corporate bottom line, an agenda also followed by Notley. On the export side of the equation, Trudeau approved two diluted bitumen pipelines plus a liquefied natural gas plant on the British Columbia coast. But he rejected Enbridge’s Northern Gateway pipeline, which by this time was clearly dead to everyone, probably including Enbridge. He also imposed a ban on oil tanker traffic from Quadra Island to north of Prince Rupert, a decision that was necessary to have any hope of moving forward on the national energy strategy.\\nThe day before Trudeau approved the pipelines in November 2016, Manley restated his two points as a “grand bargain”: acquiescing to a price on carbon on one side, building pipelines on the other. Manley reminded all and sundry that the Business Council of Canada had signed on to carbon pricing, so long as it meant getting resources out of the ground and to their customers. “I would be very surprised if there were no pipelines emerging from this,” Manley said at a business forum in Lake Louise, Alberta sponsored by law firm Bennett Jones. “Acquiescence to a price on carbon really is looked at as one side of a grand bargain that would see pipelines built in return.”\\nThe day after Trudeau approved the pipelines, Manley applauded, claiming that approving the pipelines “balances strong environmental protection with responsible energy development.”\\nThere was more to this seeming convergence between CEOs and Trudeau. The Liberal government’s blueprint for a low-carbon future, the “Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change,” was eerily similar to the declaration of Manley’s group nine years earlier, “Clean Growth: Building a Canadian Environmental Superpower.” Aside from a focus on clean growth — a declaration that growth will continue whatever “clean” comes to mean — the parallels in the documents are remarkable.\\nThe chief executives demanded a “coherent national plan of action”; Trudeau delivers a pan-Canadian framework, not quite a national plan, but on the way.\\nThe chief executives asked for investment in new technologies; Trudeau delivers investment in clean technologies.\\nThe chief executives demanded price signals such as emissions trading or carbon tax; Trudeau delivers carbon pricing through either emissions trading or carbon tax.\\nPierre vs. Justin\\nFor most of the world, the oil crisis of the 1970s and the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 have little in common beyond the fact they both were all about humanity’s seemingly bottomless appetite for burning fossil fuels.\\nBut Canada has an additional commonality: a member of the Trudeau family was leading the country during each of these events.\\nPrime minister Pierre Trudeau took dramatic action, creating a national energy company and exerting aggressive public oversight of the industry, in the process enraging the big oil companies and their allies in Edmonton and Washington, D.C.\\nHis son, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, put forward modest measures Big Oil itself had been advocating for a decade, receiving industry’s plaudits.\\nOne Trudeau tried to counter Big Oil’s dominance; the other did Big Oil’s bidding. Pierre Trudeau’s message was this: Canadian oil policy must be for the benefit of Canadians. Justin Trudeau’s message was this: Climate change isn’t a crisis but a market opportunity. We can deal with it by putting a price on carbon and by investing in clean growth.\\nHow did this happen? How did we go from giving the oil industry orders to having the oil industry dictate climate policy?\\nThe answer could be simply that father and son had very different personalities and values. Or it could be that the oil crisis, with its immediate impacts on consumers, workers and investors, required more direct intervention than global warming, a problem that could be pushed off to the future.\\nBut more was at play. When Trudeau the elder created Petro-Canada and introduced the National Energy Program, Keynesianism still reigned supreme. Government intervention in the economy was legitimate. By the time of Trudeau the younger, neoliberalism had transformed economic and political thinking, decreeing that only the market can make decisions.\\nNeoliberalism reduces the role of government to creating and enforcing markets, and propping them up when they fail, as in the 2008 financial meltdown. Otherwise, just get out of the way.\\nAt first, for decades, Big Oil denied climate change. Then, in a second delaying tactic, it switched to advocating voluntary actions by individual companies and carbon markets. Finally, in 2007, it decided on the way forward. Climate change was real, the industry acknowledged. But instead of being a threat to the bottom line it presented a golden opportunity to develop new markets. These were to be encouraged by establishing modest carbon dioxide emission reduction targets and modest carbon pricing, and promoting growth through government subsidies for clean technologies in a plan that included the approval of new pipelines.\\nAs in each of the previous evasions, the industry had staved off a day of reckoning that would have reduced Canada’s carbon footprint.\\nSelling ‘opportunities’\\nBy February 2016, the long-awaited national energy strategy was rolling into the station. Trudeau had already adopted the business framing of a transition to a low-carbon economy as an opportunity. In preparation for meetings in Vancouver with provincial and territorial leaders, a press release from Trudeau’s office said the talks “will focus on effective ways to... capitalize on the opportunities presented by a low-carbon economy,” not on what we must do to keep global warming within two degrees Celsius.\\nIn Paris the year before, at the make-or-break climate change meetings, the talk had been all about two degrees Celsius and even 1.5 degrees Celsius, a vastly more ambitious target promoted by Trudeau’s Minister of Environment Catherine McKenna. It was a target Canada had no intention of meeting, as became obvious over the next year.\\nCanada’s goal was to cut greenhouse gas emissions — its intended nationally determined contribution — 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, reducing emission from 742 megatonnes to 517 megatonnes, admittedly a daunting task (projected as of December 2016). “Canada is back,” Trudeau was telling the assembled dignitaries. Yet while McKenna was setting praiseworthy temperature and emission-reduction targets, she was designing Canada’s escape hatch as well, as chair of the Article 6 committee that authorized emission markets.\\nMcKenna led an informal consultation that put forward proposals presented to the UNFCCC by the International Emissions Trading Association. This is a global organization of oil and gas companies, banks, law firms and consultancies organized by energy giant BP to promote carbon markets during UN negotiations.\\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement lays out rules for countries that choose to engage “on a voluntary basis in co-operative approaches that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes towards nationally determined contributions.” In plain English, this article authorizes countries to participate in carbon markets as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by buying credits from other countries.\\nCanada may have taken the lead in this effort because it already knew it could never meet its nationally determined contribution without buying credits from other countries.\\nBogged down, bailing out\\nDuring 2018, Justin Trudeau faced mounting obstacles to the execution of the “grand bargain” he’d struck with the oil industry: we’ll allow pipeline expansion if you agree to a carbon tax. Trudeau was having difficulty delivering on either side of the equation. Some provinces dragged their heels on any kind of pricing scheme — with the election of Doug Ford, Ontario bailed on the entire concept. Meanwhile, federal opposition parties vowed to kill pricing if they came to power.\\nAt the same time, new pipelines bringing diluted bitumen to the east or west coasts, or even to the U.S., were bogged down in well-funded, highly organized opposition by environmental lobbies and First Nations, threatening oilsands expansion plans.\\nUnable to deliver, would Trudeau continue to receive oil industry support? His unusual step in the summer of 2018 of bailing out a pipeline that hadn’t even been built was a sign of how far Trudeau’s government would go to support the market. As another federal election loomed, so did the impossibility of squaring a circle. How long could Canadians be persuaded that we could burn more fossil fuel yet not cook the planet?\\nThe article is drawn from The Big Stall: How Big Oil and Think Tanks Are Blocking Action on Climate Change in Canada by Donald Gutstein.

      "{'authors': ['Nicole Magas'], 'date': '2018-12-06 16:13:29', 'title': 'Low-Carbon Leader or Perpetual Petro-State?', 'content': '2018 was the year Canada’s policy contradictions on climate and energy came home to roost, as the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tried to square its enthusiastic embrace of the Paris Agreement with its equally avid support for the country’s carbon-emitting fossil industry. With the federal election coming up in October 2019, and an equally momentous vote in Alberta scheduled for May, the story intensified through the year, and the fault lines became ever more obvious.\\nTrudeau’s determined effort to chart a middle course between fossil dependency and climate responsibility earned him angry rebukes from both sides of the line, with a growing number of columnists and analysts concluding that he can’t have it both ways. The single biggest story of the year was the federal government’s decision to give in to an ultimatum from Houston-based Kinder Morgan Ltd. and spend C$4.5 billion to buy taxpayers a 65-year-old pipeline. That decision produced a sense of utter betrayal from Indigenous and other pipeline opponents—while fossils, incredibly, still accused the government of showing inadequate support for their failing industry.\\n[button link=”/special-reports/the-energy-mix-yearbook-2018/pipeline-politics”]Read More: Pipeline Politics[/button]\\nIn the end, analysis showed Canada falling massively short of its Harper-era carbon target under the Paris accord and unable to hit the target if it continued to insist on scaling up oil and gas production. One assessment showed carbon pricing eliminating 90 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2022, but still leaving the country 90 megatonnes short of a Paris goal that Trudeau and Environment and Climate Minister Catherine McKenna had described as a floor, not a ceiling, for Canada’s climate ambition. Other analyses said Canada needed a higher carbon price and a wider suite of policy tools to get the job done, and the federal “backstop” price on carbon was on track to add 100 megatonnes to Alberta coal emissions.\\nYet the strongest assurances the government offered had to do with the certainty of new fossil projects. Even after Canada signed on to a new high-ambition declaration, McKenna declined to strengthen the country’s carbon target. Earlier in the year, she attributed the country’s emissions gap to economic growth and expressed her continuing commitment to the Paris target.\\nThen-natural resources minister Jim Carr’s energy transition advisory council anticipated a future of wind, solar, energy efficiency, and the world’s “cleanest” liquefied natural gas (LNG) production; British Columbia welcomed a C$40-billion LNG megaproject; three new B.C. LNG projects neared approval; and Energy Mix correspondent Greg Allen said a 1.5°C future would require Canada to phase out natural gas. A new Ontario cement plant was expected to emit one megatonne per year, analysis placed the social cost of carbon from the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion as high as $8.7 billion up front and $4.1 billion per year, and doctors asked Trudeau for an independent health assessment of Trans Mountain.\\n[button link=”/2018/06/05/justin-trudeau-the-speech-he-never-gave/”]Read More: Justin Trudeau: The Speech He Never Gave[/button]\\nIn November, Canada posted the G20’s highest per capita GHG emissions, as a study showed average global warming would exceed 5.0°C if the whole world followed Canada’s, Russia’s, and China’s lead.\\nClimate Action Network-Canada (CAN-Rac) said it was time for fossils to pull their weight on Canada’s climate commitments. CAN-Rac Executive Director Catherine Abreu and Environmental Defence National Program Manager Dale Marshall called for a more robust accountability mechanism for Canada’s Paris commitments, and Clean Energy Canada cited skepticism about post-carbon solutions as the new climate denial. “We didn’t have time for climate denial, and we have even less time for solutions denial,” asserted Executive Director Merran Smith and Policy Director Dan Woynillowicz.\\n[button link=”/2018/09/06/13-point-to-stop-list-offers-trudeau-a-way-forward-after-trans-mountain/”]Read More: Justin Trudeau’s 13-Point To-Stop List[/button]\\nOpinion research showed Canadians backing strong climate leadership despite concerns about cost, opposing fossil fuel subsidies by a two-thirds margin, and supporting Ottawa’s backstop price on carbon. The latter poll also showed a smaller gap between the views of Albertans and those of British Columbians than most pundits and politicians believed. Veteran climate advocate and organizer Tzeporah Berman received a vicious response, complete with death threats, when she accepted a speaking engagement from a branch of the Alberta Teachers’ Association. Berman delivered an impassioned call for dialogue, foresight, and collaboration to help the province prosper in a post-carbon world. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley arranged to follow Berman’s speech with one of her own and came back with unicorns—literally. “We are better than this,” Berman said.\\n[button link=”/2018/10/14/we-are-better-than-this-berman-explores-albertas-energy-future-notley-comes-back-with-unicorns”]Read More: We are better than this[/button]\\nPipeline to Tidewater: A False Narrative Props Up a Fading Industry\\nThe battle over Canada’s energy future was driven in large part by the shaky proposition that a prosperous future awaited Alberta, if only the stars aligned to build new pipeline capacity to tidewater. As the year progressed, it became ever clearer that that storyline was false at worst, woefully incomplete at best.\\nThe basic claim—repeated and repeated again by industry executives and Notley—was that the Alberta and Canadian economies were losing many millions of dollars per day because of the deep discount oilpatch producers had to offer for the Western Canadian Select crude oil they sell into world markets. Just get a pipeline built, they claimed, and a price differential in the range of C$50 per barrel would be cleared, or at least mitigated, bringing new benefits to the industry and the provincial economy that depends on it.\\nThe intensity ratcheted up through the fall, as falling world oil prices drove the discounted Alberta market to the point of crisis. By mid-November, major tar sands/oil sands producers were berating each other for taking “windfall profits” by grabbing all the available pipeline space they could, and the “swashbuckling free marketeers” in the oilpatch were doing precisely what you might expect: losing patience with governments for not stepping in with a fully baked solution to their problems, warning of a new wave of western Canadian separatism, accusing/not accusing Ottawa of treason, even risking the appearance of insider trading by participating in a meeting with Notley to discuss measures to restrict production volumes. Cenovus Energy urged governments to impose production cuts to drive up fossil revenue, and Notley complied.\\n“The grade of oil that Alberta sells into world markets, Western Canadian Select, hit a rock-bottom price of US$13.46 per barrel,” The Energy Mix explained at the height of the industry’s mid-November hyperbole, “its lowest since Bloomberg began keeping track in 2008. They’re producing at a loss, and they want a solution right now. And they imagine that faster federal action to approve the intensely controversial Trans Mountain pipeline extension—a project that would be years away from delivering an ounce of heavy crude if construction restarted tomorrow—will somehow give them relief from today’s problem.\\n“They also imagine that they have anything less than the federal government’s full-throated support.”\\nLater, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers CEO Tim McMillan pivoted from complaints about pipelines and oil prices to an attack on Canada’s proposed new impact assessment act, Bill 69.\\n‘People Will Die’ to Get a Pipeline Built\\nBut the harshest attacks from fossils and their supporters were reserved for campaigners on the front lines of the Trans Mountain fight. While Berman may have been the highest-profile target, she wasn’t alone. Former Bank of Canada governor David Dodge casually and chillingly suggested that “people will die” on the protest lines at Burnaby Mountain, asserting that killing off a few “extremists” might be the price Canada would have to pay to get the Trans Mountain expansion built. British Columbia’s Dogwood Initiative reported that “the hate mail is piling up” after investment banker and former Dragon’s Den panelist Brett Wilson suggested pipeline protesters should be hanged for treason. Wilson later doubled down by offering to pay B.C. New Democrat legislators to cross the floor and support the project.\\nA more sober assessment by senior economist and former insurance CEO Robyn Allan showed it was Alberta’s inferior tar sands/oil sands product, not the lack of market access, that was driving down the price the province could charge for its product. Later in the year, analysts at BNN Bloomberg agreed that a new pipeline would not eliminate the price discount on a lower-quality form of crude oil that is tougher for refineries to process. A rating agency warned that Alberta was still relying on new pipeline-related revenue to balance its budget in 2023–24, and tar sands/oil sands operations were on track to break through Alberta’s lifetime emissions cap.\\nIn an exclusive, six-part series for The Energy Mix, award-winning investigative reporter Paul McKay pointed to global competition as a fatal flaw in Alberta’s tar sands/oil sands export plans, traced the business partners Ottawa might have to sign on with to get the pipeline built, assessed the impact of new emissions controls for international shipping on Alberta production, calculated the starkly unfavourable math Canada had accepted by buying the pipeline, and made the case that Teck Resources’ proposed new tar sands/oil sands megaproject is a “dead mine walking.” Some observers speculated that Teck may not even plan to build the mine—it just wants a plausible enough appearance of that plan to set the stage for a Kinder Morgan–style bailout.\\nAnalyst David Hughes said it’s poor strategy to sell off fossil resources at bargain basement prices, BNN Bloomberg debunked the myth that a new pipeline would clear the price discount for poor-quality Alberta crude, and Oil Change International’s Adam Scott called Alberta production cuts a vision of what a managed decline could look like. Veteran Vox.com climate columnist David Roberts gave a hat-tip to supply-side campaigns that fall one step outside the climate mainstream, after economists Fergus Green and Richard Denniss made a “cogent argument that the activists are onto something—that restrictive supply-side (RSS) climate policies have unique economic and political benefits and deserve a place alongside carbon prices and renewable energy supports in the climate policy toolkit.”\\nSome 50,000 people rallied in Montreal to demand provincial climate action, days before 6,000 protesters closed five London bridges in Extinction Rebellion’s first major action.\\nAlberta’s oil and gas royalties plummeted while production increased, even though the province’s fossil companies remained incredibly profitable through a sustained oil price crash. A few months of higher oil prices fueled optimism but not euphoria in the oilpatch before prices crashed again; labour-saving efficiencies wiped out thousands of Alberta fossil jobs; and declines in investment, jobs, and tax revenue pointed to the end of the tar sands/oil sands era.\\n[button link=”/special-reports/the-energy-mix-yearbook-2018/fossils-go-for-broke/”]Read More: Fossil Industry Goes for Broke[/button]\\nThe head of the Alberta Energy Regulator resigned after revealing the province could face up to $260 billion in unfunded oilpatch liabilities. The carbon liabilities facing the province’s five biggest fossils were calculated at $2 trillion. Équiterre said a spike in pipeline incidents showed up the industry’s safety claims as “meaningless marketing mantras,” and Albertans were set to bear the clean-up costs for 155,000 abandoned oil and gas.\\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer was looking forward to making carbon pricing a ballot issue in the 2019 federal election, but was expected to pay a price at the polls for opposing carbon pricing and supporting pipelines. The federal backstop price earned support from a conservative-led think tank, the Globe and Mail, a normally critical climate hawk, and public opinion for promising a carbon price rebate in almost every mailbox.\\nOttawa was set to remit $420 million directly to Ontario climate initiatives after the Doug Ford government dismantled the province’s successful carbon cap-and-trade program, cancelled 758 renewable energy contracts, and stopped construction of the White Pines wind farm as it neared completion.', 'source_domain': 'www.theenergymix.com', 'url': 'https://www.theenergymix.com/canadas-contradiction-low-carbon-leader-or-perpetual-petro-state/'}\n",

Kenney’s government invested $1.5 billion directly into the Keystone XL pipeline that runs from Alberta all the way down to Texas. In addition to putting up funds for the construction of the pipeline, Kenney also provided another $6 billion in loan guarantees for the project. His enthusiasm was, however, not matched by his neighbors south of the border. On his first day in office, Joe Biden, in keeping with his campaign promise, canceled the construction permit. Kenney’s bad bet — made with public money — was evidently made on the assumption that Donald Trump was going to win a second term. Nationalizing pipelines appears to be in vogue with Canadian governments of all political stripes these days. Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberal Party government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018. The petroleum industry, meanwhile, has been content with this direct government intervention, but has nevertheless continued to moan that “we lack a clear national energy strategy.” The industry maintains that global market access has been inhibited by the absence of new pipeline infrastructure. Its representatives have complained that “although Canada produces much more crude oil than it consumes, incredibly we import 760,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the US and other foreign countries.” The last time a federal government tried to implement a national energy strategy, it was greeted with teeth-gnashing and apoplectic fury from Canada’s West. In 1980, the federal Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau, father of the current prime minister, introduced the National Energy Program (NEP) to build cross-country pipelines to ensure that Canada did not need to import foreign crude. Not only did the oil industry revolt against the intervention, but the backlash in Alberta set the stage for decades of outrage and self-pitying claims of victimhood on the part of regional oil producers. The NEP saga is still relevant today because its legacy is baked into the politics of energy in Canada. It pitted public benefit against private interest for control of national energy resources. Oil companies fiercely resisted attempts at state-directed oil development in favor of letting profit decide where pipelines should go. The consequence was that pipelines went mostly to the United States, locking Canadian oil exports into a single market.\\nPostwar Oil Production Understanding the roots of the NEP and the current politics of energy requires some knowledge of the history of oil and gas development in Canada after World War II. In 1947, Canada found huge oil deposits in Leduc, Alberta. The ensuing oil boom rapidly transformed the province’s rural agricultural economy into an industrialized oil exporter. As of 2019, Canada has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world at 167 billion barrels, almost all of which is in Alberta. Canadian energy policy in the 1950s and 1960s was concerned with promoting expansion of the domestic oil industry. In 1961, the national oil market was split in two. East of the Ottawa Valley, where most Canadians lived, oil was imported cheaply from the world market. In the West, the oil market was protected from imports and consumers paid higher prices to subsidize domestic production. Because the Canadian oil industry was largely American-owned and primarily exported to the US market, Western Canada was also integrated into the US oil market through price-fixing agreements. This arrangement collapsed in 1973. In response to Western support for Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab oil-producing countries cut off their crude exports to much of the developed capitalist world. Oil prices had been low and stable since 1945, but between October 1973 and March 1974 — when the embargo ended — prices more than tripled. They would stay high for a decade, with a further spike in 1979 thanks to the Iranian Revolution. Although Canada was a net oil exporter, its divided market and lack of East-West pipelines meant that the country could not supply itself entirely through its domestic production. In 1973, the country shipped fifty percent of its oil and gas south of the border. At the same time, Eastern Canada was hit by extremely high fuel prices. Because the industry was largely US-owned, the windfall profits from high prices were shipped south too and did not directly benefit the Canadian economy.\\nThe National Energy Program The Liberal federal government of Pierre Trudeau responded by freezing the domestic price of crude at $4 a barrel, well below the world price. Next, the government implemented a tax on oil exports to discourage companies from simply selling domestically produced oil on the world market to avoid Canada’s price cap. The government then poured public money into developing unconventional oil sources such as the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta. In 1975, the Liberals created the state-owned company Petro-Canada to aid these efforts. Prices remained high through the 1970s. The federal government decided that a more comprehensive plan was needed to secure Canadian energy sovereignty. In the 1980 election, the Liberals campaigned on a “made-in-Canada” oil price, and, after winning, they introduced the NEP. The NEP had three main goals: fair energy prices for Canadian consumers; an increase in Canadian ownership (both public and private) to majority stakes of the oil and gas sector; and the securing of Canada’s energy supplies. Accomplishing these goals would give Canada energy sovereignty, insulate domestic energy prices from world market–price spikes, and ensure most of the profits earned by the petroleum sector stayed in Canada. In practice, these goals were accomplished using a series of price controls and tax incentives, rather than any wholesale nationalization of foreign assets. Domestic oil prices were capped below the world market, but the government also established a price floor to cover for a potential fall in global crude prices. Taxes on resource revenues were recycled to Canadian petroleum companies that prospected for new fields in joint partnership with Petro-Canada. Pierre Trudeau’s government also planned cross-country pipelines to end his country’s dependence on imports. Over the five-year lifespan of the NEP, consumers benefited from stable fuel prices, and Canadian ownership significantly increased. However, foreign companies did retain dominance, especially in refining and retail. On balance, the NEP was successful in using government intervention to increase Canadian public benefits from the country’s energy resources.\\nThe Right-Wing Backlash Unsurprisingly, the oil industry hated the NEP and threatened to reduce investment. Petro-Canada’s headquarters in downtown Calgary was derisively called “Red Square” by right-wing oilmen who resented “socialist” government intervention in their industry. The NEP remains one of the foundational flashpoints for Alberta’s resentment of perceived federal government overreach. Popular bumper stickers from the time read, “Let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark,” “I’d rather push this thing a mile than buy gas from PetroCan,” and “Pierre Elliot Trudeau Rips Off Canada.” The high prices for oil after 1973 were not the result of an increase in the cost of production, which remained more or less stable throughout the period, but instead had geopolitical roots. This meant that producers were capturing massive windfall profits on every barrel of oil they exported to the United States. The NEP’s prioritization of the Canadian domestic market, price controls, and higher royalty taxes cut into the huge profit margins of the mostly US companies. The Alberta provincial government also opposed the NEP, seeing it as a federal intrusion on provincial jurisdiction over resources. Federal price and export controls reduced provincial royalty revenue from high global prices. The Alberta government of Progressive Conservative Peter Lougheed was also deeply intertwined with the oil industry. Alberta’s intransigence forced several rounds of renegotiation with the federal government over price setting in 1981 and 1983. The result of this showdown was the blunting of some of the effects of the NEP. In 1984, the Progressive Conservatives of Brian Mulroney defeated the Liberal federal government. As promised, he dismantled the NEP the next year and, in the early 1990s, privatized Petro-Canada. The oil industry got the free market it wanted. But by 1985, the oil glut on the world market had caused prices to collapse. This drove Alberta into a severe and protracted recession.', 'source_domain': 'jacobin.com', 'url': 'https://jacobin.com/2021/10/canada-pierre-trudeau-nep-oil-economic-planning-fossil-fuels'}\n",

      "{'authors': ['John Geddes'], 'date': '2016-01-07 20:21:52', 'title': 'Stephen Poloz explains what Justin Trudeau is up against', 'content': 'Ottawa is buoyed by a frantic energy. But the Bank of Canada governor warns that there’s no easy policy fix for the economy—it needs to work itself out\\nThere are a lot of moving parts in an economy like Canada’s, but often it’s helpful to narrow the focus, especially when you’re trying to sort out possible political responses to economic problems. Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz helped out today by neatly quantifying the pain Canadians are feeling as a result of the plummet in the price of oil and other natural resources.\\nIn a breakfast speech in Ottawa, Poloz first reminded the business crowd of the blissfully long stretch, lasting from 2001 to about mid-2014, when strong commodity prices lifted the Canadian economy. “Since then, however, falling world prices for oil and other commodities have reversed much of that rise,” he said. “Measured at annual rates, this represents a loss of more than $50 billion in national income, or about $1,500 for every Canadian.”\\nWe all know what $1,500 is, but how much is $50 billion? Well, 10 times more, for instance, than the infrastructure boost that the Liberals pledged in their winning fall election campaign. Justin Trudeau’s platform promised a doubling of federal infrastructure spending to $10 billion from $5 billion in each of the next two fiscal years. (Asked how much the infrastructure injection might stimulate the economy, Poloz declined today to discuss the potential impact.)\\nThe comparison brings home how hard it will be for any government action to ease the wrenching adjustment the Canadian economy is now going through. Of course, that pain isn’t evenly distributed. Poloz noted that since the fall of 2014, the unemployment rate is up more than two percentage points in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador, the three main oil producing provinces, but flat in the rest of the country.\\nDon’t imagine that a merely regional slump in energy and mining is anywhere close to being equalled yet by a bounce in other parts of the country. Poloz said that’s coming, as the decline in the value of the petro-linked loonie makes Canadian manufactured exports cheaper, but he was careful not to predict exactly when those watched-for positives would outweigh the all-too-present negatives.\\nThe transition won’t be quick, though. “The tension between sectors and between regions will remain a feature for some time, measured in years,” he said, adding: “It typically takes three or five years to adjust to a significant movement in your terms of trade, which is what we’re going through.”\\nSo Finance Minister Bill Morneau must deliver the Trudeau government’s first budget next month, or perhaps the month after, in what’s still the early phase of a tough adjustment, which might last through the Liberals’ entire first mandate. Making middle-income Canadians feel that the government is delivering the promised new era of buoyant incomes and better expectations in this climate will be a huge challenge.\\nOne possible reaction to all this is might be to bemoan the misguided over-emphasis on oil of the Stephen Harper era. Trudeau has in the past identified that as a basic economic-strategy blunder. In a speech around this time a year ago, he asked rhetorically: “So, first question: Why would the Harper Conservatives bet so much of Canada’s future on oil prices staying high? Because they didn’t—they never do.”\\nPoloz agreed today that the fall of oil and other resource prices has followed “an oft-repeated, textbook cycle.” Still, when asked by a reporter after his speech what lesson Canada should draw from this painful, familiar experience, he didn’t profess to have any hard-earned wisdom to impart.\\n“Some have talked about, ‘Did we become excessively enthusiastic or excessively exposed to energy?’ I usually resist that argument, because the market was telling us people were willing to pay up to $100 a barrel for oil,” he said. “It would have been quite unusual behaviour to say, ‘No, I’m not going to take advantage of that by investing more in the oil patch.’ ”\\nParliament Hill is crackling with expectation these days. The mood generated by Trudeau is all about doing stuff. But transferring that sense of bustling activism to the wider economy will be far harder than, say, launching an inquiry, scheduling a meeting with the provinces, or starting a policy consultation process.\\nIn fact, Poloz went so far as to declare that there is nothing much to be done, except wait for the economy to pivot toward higher investment and employment in the non-resource sectors. “There is no simple policy response in this situation,” he said flatly. “The forces that have been set in motion simply must work themselves out. The economy’s adjustment process can be difficult and painful for individuals, and there are policies that can help buffer those effects, but the adjustments must eventually happen.”\\nIt’s odd to hear anybody in Ottawa talking that way these days.', 'source_domain': 'macleans.ca', 'url': 'https://macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/stephen-poloz-explains-what-justin-trudeau-is-up-against/'}\n",

      "{'authors': ['Keith Reynolds'], 'date': '2011-05-18 09:48:13', 'title': 'Have we completely bought the idea that “There Is No Alternative”?', 'content': 'Once again, over the last few weeks Canadians have had energy costs on our minds. Prices at the pump rocketed up to nearly $1.50, while the price of a barrel of oil was actually going down.\\nWhat can we possibly do? Industry officials blame unrest in the Middle East and floods on the Mississippi. Former Liberal MP Dan McTeague, who has followed the issue for some time, says “the price of gas can be whatever a handful of players in Canada want it to be.” And federal Industry Minister Tony Clement said he will ask oil industry refiners, distributors and retailers to appear before a parliamentary committee to explain their “opaque” pricing methods once Parliament resumes.\\nAll of which, of course, will amount to absolutely nothing. Then, we will do it all over again the next time we have a spike in costs.\\nWhat I find remarkable is just how much our choices seem to have been limited over the years.\\nWe first began to think about this issue nearly 40 years ago in the early 1970s when OPEC members decided to combat years of declining energy prices by combining to increase the cost of oil.\\nIn Canada energy concerns were increased by growing foreign domination of our energy sector and increasing concerns about our own supply of oil.\\nIt was also a time of growing Canadian nationalism. For two years with a minority Liberal government, the NDP under David Lewis pressured Pierre Trudeau take some action after years of neglect had led to the almost complete takeover of Canada’s energy industry by foreign corporations. In 1974 Trudeau recaptured a majority but in 1975 his government still introduced a measure to give Canada some control over its energy – Bill C-8, the Petro-Canada Act.\\nThe Liberal Energy Minister was Donald MacDonald, a man who would subsequently lead the Royal Commission that would recommend free trade with the United States. But in 1975 he had different views. Speaking in the House of Commons MacDonald said:\\nThis bill is a most important element in the government’s long-term planning to secure adequate supplies of energy to meet our national needs. It is firmly rooted in the basic objectives of our energy and resource policies which are, to ensure for Canadians adequate and reliable supplies at reasonable prices, as well as a direct share in the wealth which the development of our resources generates.\\nSpeaking of the now controversial oil sands MacDonald said:\\nThe largest private entities which may be potential participants in oil sands projects are necessarily the foreign controlled internationals. The best way to secure a Canadian presence, a rate of development consistent with our national interest, a proper share of the income generated by such activity and full access to new technology, is by direct government involvement in key ventures through a corporation which can develop the necessary expertise.\\nHe continued:\\nIt is striking that every one of the dozen countries from which we import significant quantities of crude oil has its own state oil company and is progressively increasing the role of that company in relation to international transactions. If circumstances continue to develop in this direction, it could well be more advantageous for us to import some of our crude oil through a public enterprise rather than entirely by means of private companies.\\nMacDonald pointed out that Canada’s energy sector was 90% foreign controlled and said:\\nOne way in which Canadians can assert their presence in this heavily dominated sector is by having a nationally owned company which could bring together smaller Canadian companies into a larger, more competitive entity through joint ventures and the forming of consortia.\\nConservative energy critic James Gillies responded to MacDonald. Gillies was a former chair of the Ontario Economic Council. Many of the Conservative arguments against the Bill would be familiar to us. But many of his comments would astonish us if we heard them from the Conservative government today. He said:\\nNo one today objects to the proposition that it is the government’s responsibility to provide a level of employment, to keep prices stable, to do something about regional disparities and to lessen disparity of income among individuals in different parts of the nation.\\nHe presented an alternative solution to foreign domination of the sector. He said:\\nIf the government is serious about the proposition that there is too much control of the petroleum industry in Canada in foreign hands, surely the answer is to change the tax laws to make it more attractive to Canadians to invest in the industry, and more attractive for companies which own shares to divest them to Canadians.\\nThis solution subsequently disappeared with the passage of trade agreements requiring foreign companies to be treated equally with Canadian companies.\\nResponding for the NDP was Tommy Douglas, retired as leader of the party but still serving as its energy critic. Douglas told the House:\\nIt should be remembered that the people of Canada have paid billions of dollars to enlarge and enrich foreign oil companies, and only now, belatedly, are we setting up an economic vehicle to develop our petroleum resources for the benefit of Canadians.\\nWhile Douglas supported the idea of the legislation he wondered if it went far enough.\\nThis House must recognize that passing this Bill will mean nothing at all unless Petro-Canada is given a real role in the oil industry in this country. This Crown Corporation is an economic tool and nothing more. It can e used effectively, or it can lie idle and hardly be used at all.\\nHe suggested to the House\\nThat Petro-Canada can be a very useful economic instrument. It can be used to break the economic stranglehold of the foreign oil cartel which, as the Minister said this afternoon, controls over 90 per cent of our production and some 99 per cent of our oil refining. This international oligarchy has squandered our Canadian resources, fleeced the Canadian public, and now it stands ready to hold the government and the people of Canada to ransom to compel us to accept its terms in order to get the economic development we need to meet our oil and gas needs.\\nThe Petro-Canada Bill was passed and the company began operation in January 1976. It expanded through the 1980s until the beginning of the 1990s when the Mulroney government began its privatization. Jean Chretien finished the privatization process. Petro-Canada went through good times and bad but I know we would be better off today if Canada still owned a major oil company.\\nOur response to energy shocks 35 years ago was Petro-Canada. We talked about the national interest. We talked about how to capture a proper share the value of our resources. What is our response today? Oil companies will be politely invited to appear before a Commons committee where they will give their well rehearsed excuses.\\nThe triumph of the oil companies is that today the thought of a Petro-Canada like solution is not even considered. Canadians can barely imagine their right to control and benefit from our resources. Albertans are convinced that even with pitiful returns on their oil royalties, they are better off being run by foreign oil companies than governed by a democratically elected government.\\nFor 30 years we have seen our political options narrow. We need a discussion as to how we can widen them again.\\nFor people who are interested, I am attaching the entire House of Commons debate here in PDF format. It is worth the read if only to remind ourselves of how limited our thinking has become.\\nTopics: Climate change & energy policy', 'source_domain': 'www.policynote.ca', 'url': 'https://www.policynote.ca/have-we-completely-bought-the-idea-that-there-is-no-alternative/'}\n",

      "{'authors': ['Vijay Prashad', 'February'], 'date': '2024-02-17 19:44:29', 'title': 'A Word Like Peace Is Faster Than the Bullet of War', 'content': 'Erik Bulatov (USSR), Horizon, 1971–72.\\nOn 26 January, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) announced the start of a massive military exercise called Steadfast Defender 2024 that will continue until the end of May. Over 90,000 troops from NATO countries (and one partner country, Sweden), including fifty naval groups and more than eighty air platforms, will deploy in thirteen countries to demonstrate the alliance’s capacity and ‘send a robust message about its readiness to protect all Allies in the face of emerging threats’. Of the thirty-one NATO member states, six share borders with Russia (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Norway). This NATO exercise comes just as the European Union announced that it will provide Ukraine with €50 billion in financial support between now and 2027, a reduction compared to the North Atlantic support over the past two years. As public support for the war in Ukraine declines in the Global North states, governments have decided to ramp up tensions along the Russian border through NATO.\\nFollowing the announcement of the Steadfast Defender 2024 exercise, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg travelled to the United States and met US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon. Interestingly, their public comments did not express a shred of concern for the Ukrainian people. Stoltenberg referred instead to the Global North’s anxiety about Russia and China, saying that support for Ukraine is ‘an investment in our own security because the world will become more dangerous if President Putin wins in Ukraine’, warning that the result of this conflict ‘is also closely watched in China’. So, it is not the Ukrainians and their wellbeing that matters but the geostrategic necessity for the Global North to see Russia (and by implication, China) ‘weakened’, as Austin said in Kyiv two years earlier.\\nTo shed light on this conflict, its global implications, and the possibility of peace, the rest of this newsletter is dedicated to No Cold War’s briefing no. 12: The War in Ukraine Must End.\\nTwo years ago, on 24 February 2022, Russian forces entered Ukraine. This act was not the start of the war in Ukraine. Rather, it was the acceleration of a conflict that dates back to at least 2014. That year, at the behest of the United States, a new government was imposed on Ukraine, aiming to bring the country closer to the European Union. This initiated the sustained persecution of the country’s Russian-speaking population. The conflict moved swiftly, with Crimea de facto becoming part of Russia once again and the Donbass region of Ukraine becoming a frontline in the conflict between Ukrainian far-right nationalists and Russian speakers. In May 2019, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took office and pledged to end the battle in the Donbass. Instead, due to pressure from NATO, the conflict intensified, eventually leading to the Russian intervention three years later. It is imperative for the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the world that the war be halted and that the issues be transferred from the battlefield to the negotiating table.\\nTuyo (Germany), Elephant, 2021.\\nWhat has been the impact of the war?\\nIn any conflict, casualty figures become a matter of dispute. However, there is little disagreement that over 500,000 Ukrainian and Russian soldiers have died or been injured in this war, that over six million Ukrainians have fled the country, and that over seven million Ukrainians have been internally displaced (out of a pre-war population of nearly 44 million). If the war is not brought to a halt, tens of thousands more will be killed and tens of millions more will suffer.\\nUkraine’s economy has been devastated, shrinking by 29% in 2022 alone, according to the World Bank. The impact of the war ricocheted across the globe, causing wheat prices to rise by 21% and some fertilisers to rise by 40% within the first month of the conflict. Global South countries were hit particularly hard by sharp increases in food and energy prices in many regions while the European economy inches towards a recession. In other countries, astronomic amounts of resources have been diverted to the war which instead could have been used for social and economic spending. The US and Europe have already spent well over $200 billion on the war. In December 2023, the head of the Ukrainian armed forces asked US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin for a further $350–400 billion to pursue ‘victory’.\\nIn reality, no amount of money will lead to a military triumph. It is clear, particularly after the failure of the Ukrainian ‘counter-offensive’, that there has been no significant change in the military situation, nor is there a credible prospect of one. The continued payment of such huge human and economic costs would be purposeless.\\nAlexey Kryukov (Russia), Безмолвие. Саур-Могила (‘Silence – Saur-Mogila’), 2017.\\nWhat issues need to be resolved?\\n1) The position of Ukraine regarding military blocs. At the end of the Cold War, Europe had an opportunity to pursue peaceful economic development. A coherent and balanced economy with enormous potential could have been formed by reducing military spending while combining Western Europe’s high value-added manufacturing and service industries with the former Soviet Union’s energy, raw materials, agriculture, and high-technology industries such as space. In East Asia, which overcame a period of even greater Cold War division and conflict (as seen in the Korean and successive Vietnam and Indochina wars), a focus on mutually beneficial economic development and an avoidance of military and political blocs led it to become the world’s most rapidly growing economic region. This is evidenced by the fact that, since 1990, the GDP of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has grown by more than 400%. However, in Europe, the US insisted that such policies not be followed and that, instead, the region was to expand the NATO military bloc into Eastern Europe, breaking the commitment it had made at the time of German reunification that NATO would not advance ‘one inch eastward’ towards Russia. The US was fully aware that NATO’s expansion would greatly inflame tensions with Russia and across Europe. Of particular sensitivity was the possibility of Ukraine’s entry into NATO, which would bring the nuclear-armed bloc within immediate striking range of Moscow. Numerous experts on Eastern Europe and Russia strongly and repeatedly advised against such expansion of NATO. Most famously, George Kennan, the original architect of US Cold War policy, predicted in 1997 that, ‘expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era’. In December 2021, Russia proposed an agreement that Ukraine would not become a NATO member. In negotiations in March 2022, Ukraine proposed adopting a neutral status in exchange for security guarantees, inspired by NATO’s collective defence clause, which could have involved Poland, Israel, Turkey, and Canada as guarantors. This was blocked by NATO, directly conveyed by way of an urgent visit from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Ukraine in May 2022, thereby preventing a rapid end of the war.\\n2) The position of the Russian-speaking minority in the territory of the Ukrainian state (as it was formed in 1991). A 2001 census found that nearly 30% of Ukraine’s population considered Russian to be their native language. States with large linguistic and ethnic minority populations can only maintain their unity if the rights of such minorities are respected. The policies of the Ukrainian government after 2014, which included suppressing the official use of the Russian language in numerous spheres, were therefore bound to lead to an explosive crisis within the Ukrainian state. As the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission, which certainly cannot be accused of being pro-Russian, stated: ‘the current Law on National Minorities is far from providing adequate guarantees for the protection of minorities… many other provisions which restrict the use of minority languages have already been in force since 16 July 2019’. There are only two ways to resolve this situation: restoration of the full linguistic and other rights of the Russian-speaking minority within the borders of the old Ukrainian state or the secession of these regions from Ukraine. Which outcome is realised will be a key subject of the negotiations. Nonetheless, it is clear that any attempt to maintain the Russian-speaking minority within the Ukrainian state while continuing to deprive them of their rights will not succeed, nor will any attempt by Russia to impose another state on the Ukrainian-speaking population of western and northern Ukraine.\\nAll efforts to resolve these issues by military means will continue to be futile and will only result in further intense suffering, above all for the Ukrainian people. These realities will become increasingly obvious if the war continues – which is why it must be brought to a halt as rapidly as possible and negotiations must commence.\\nMahamoudou Zinkone ‘Babs’ (Burkina Faso), Maquis Las Palmas, 2015.\\nIn 1961, the Soviet poet Volodymyr Mikolayovich Sosiura wrote a song on the power of words. Sosiura was born in Debaltseve (which is today in Donetsk) in 1898 within the Tsarist empire and died as a member of the communist party in Kyiv in 1965. He wrote several poems that oscillated between his patriotic love for Ukraine and his commitment to the Soviet Union and to the communist struggle. Above all else, Sosiura – who fought in World War I in Bakhmut and then later joined the Red Army – had a great disdain for war. He recognised the importance of the war against the Nazis, but – like many of his generation – bemoaned the terrible loss of life incurred by this war, such as the 27 million Soviet citizens who died in the fight to defeat the Nazi armies, amongst them 19 million civilians. This was the context of Sosiura’s beautiful poem about words:\\nI know the power of the word.\\nIt is sharper than a bayonet\\nand faster than even a bullet,\\nFaster than an airplane.\\n…\\nOh, weapon of happiness: word!\\nI am used to living beside you.\\nYou are a flower in love,\\nyou are a bayonet in hate.', 'source_domain': 'dissidentvoice.org', 'url': 'https://dissidentvoice.org/2024/02/a-word-like-peace-is-faster-than-the-bullet-of-war/'}\n",

You Can Read His New E-Book', 'Colin Todhunter', 'February'], 'date': '2024-02-18 14:38:51', 'title': 'Farmers’ Protest in India Reignites: A Struggle for the Future of Food and Agriculture', 'content': 'In 2021, after a year-long protest, India’s farmers brought about the repeal of three farm laws that were intended to ‘liberalise’ the agriculture sector. Now, in 2024, farmers are again protesting. The underlying issues and the facilitation of the neoliberal corporatisation of farming that sparked the previous protest remain and have not been resolved.\\nThe World Bank, the World Trade Organization, global agribusiness and financial capital are working to corporatise India’s agriculture sector. This plan goes back to the early 1990s and India’s foreign exchange crisis, which was used (and manipulated) to set this plan in motion. This ‘structural adjustment’ policy and process involves displacing the current food production system with contract farming and an industrial model of agriculture and food retail that serves the above interests.\\nThe aim is to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture to a facilitator of private capital, which requires industrial commodity-crop farming. The beneficiaries will include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midlands, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge and India’s retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech, seed and agrochemical corporations and the big tech companies with their ‘data-driven agriculture’.\\nThe plan is to displace the peasantry, create a land market and amalgamate landholdings to form larger farms that are more suited to international land investors and industrial farming. As a result, there has been an ongoing strategy to make farming non-viable for many of India’s smallholder farmers and drive hundreds of millions out of farming and into urban centres that have already sprawled to form peri-urban areas, which often tend to contain the most agriculturally fertile land. The loss of such land should be a concern in itself.\\nAnd what will those hundreds of millions do? Driven to the cities because of deliberate impoverishment, they will serve as cheap labour or, more likely, an unemployed or underemployed reserve army of labour for global capital — labour which is being replaced with automation. They will be in search of jobs that are increasingly hard to come by the (World Bank reports that there is more than 23% youth unemployment in India).\\nThe impoverishment of farmers results from rising input costs, the withdrawal of government assistance, debt and debt repayments and the impacts of cheap, subsidised imports, which depress farmers’ incomes.\\nWhile corporations in India receive massive handouts and have loans written off, the lack of a secure income, exposure to volatile and manipulated international market prices and cheap imports contribute to farmers’ misery of not being able to cover the costs of production and secure a decent standard of living.\\nThe pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented ‘free market’ trade is based on nothing but hypocrisy. For instance, according to policy analyst Devinder Sharma, subsidies provided to US wheat and rice farmers are more than the market worth of these two crops. He also notes that, per day, each cow in Europe receives a subsidy worth more than an Indian farmer’s daily income.\\nThe World Bank, the World Trade Organization, global institutional investors and transnational agribusiness giants require corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce. They demand that India sacrifice its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of billionaires.\\nFarmers are merely regarded as producers of raw materials (crops) to be fleeced by suppliers of chemical and biotech inputs and the food processing and retail conglomerates. The more farmers can be squeezed, the greater the profits these corporations can extract. This entails creating farmer dependency on costly external inputs and corporate-dominated markets and supply chains. Global agrifood corporations have cleverly and cynically weaved a narrative that equates eradicating food sovereignty and creating dependency with ‘food security’.\\nFarmers’ demands\\nIn 2018, a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (an umbrella group of around 250 farmers’ organisations). The farmers were concerned about the deepening penetration of predatory corporations and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors.\\nThey wanted the government to take measures to bring down the input costs of farming, while making purchases of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) both illegal and punishable.\\nThe charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system, the withdrawal of pesticides that have been banned elsewhere and the non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment.\\nOther demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing, the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming, investment in farmers’ collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival.\\nThese demands remain relevant today due to government inaction. In fact, the three farm laws that were repealed after a year-long protest by farmers in 2021 aimed to do precisely the opposite. They were intended to expose Indian agriculture to a massive dose of neoliberal marketisation and shock therapy. Although the laws were struck down, the corporate interests behind them never went away and are adamant that the Indian government implements the policies they require.\\nThis would mean India reducing the state procurement and distribution of essential foodstuffs and eradicating its food buffer stocks — so vital to national food security — and purchasing the nation’s needs with its foreign exchange reserves on manipulated global commodity markets. This would make the country wholly dependent on attracting foreign investment and international finance.\\nTo ensure food sovereignty and national food security, the Mumbai-based Research Unit for Political Economy (RUPE) says that MSPs, through government procurement of essential crops and commodities, should be extended to many major cops such as maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at the MSP.\\nSince per capita protein consumption in India is abysmally low and has fallen further during the liberalisation era, the provision of pulses in the public distribution system (PDS) is long overdue and desperately needed. The PDS works with central government, via the Food Corporation of India, being responsible for buying food grains from farmers at MSPs at state-run market yards or mandis. It then allocates the grains to each state. State governments then deliver to ‘ration shops’.\\nToday, in 2024, farm union leaders are (among other demands) seeking guarantees for a minimum purchase price for crops. Although the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, government agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level and, even then, in only some states.\\nState agencies buy the two staples at government-fixed minimum support prices to build reserves to run the world’s biggest food welfare programme that entitles more than 800 million Indians to free rice and wheat. Currently, that’s more than half the population who per household will receive five kilos per month of these essential foodstuffs for at least the next four years, which would be denied to them by the ‘free market’. As we have seen throughout the world, corporate plunder under the guise of neoliberal marketisation is no friend of the poor and those in need who rely on state support to exist.\\nIf public procurement of a wider range of crops at the MSP were to occur — and MSPs were guaranteed for rice and wheat across all states — it would help address hunger and malnutrition, encourage crop diversification and ease farmer distress. Indeed, as various commentators have stated, by helping hundreds of millions involved in farming this way, it would give a massive boost to rural spending power and the economy in general.\\nInstead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to what constitutes a transnational billionaire class and its corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution.\\nThe RUPE notes, it would cost around 20% of the current handouts (‘incentives’) received by corporations and their super-rich owners, which do not benefit the bulk of the wider population in any way. It is also worth considering that the loans provided to just five large corporations in India were in 2016 equal to the entire farm debt.\\nHowever, it is clear that the existence of the MSP, the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks are an impediment to global agribusiness interests.\\nFarmers’ other demands include a complete debt waiver, a pension scheme for farmers and farm labourers, the reintroduction of subsidies scrapped by the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020 and the right to fair compensation and transparency concerning land acquisitions.\\nIn the meantime, the current administration is keen to demonstrate to international finance capital and agricapital that it is being tough on farmers and remains steadfast in its willingness to facilitate the pro-corporate agenda.\\nAfter the recent breakdown in talks between government and farmers’ representatives, the farmers decided to peacefully march to and demonstrate in Delhi. But at the Delhi border, farmers were met with barricades, tear gas and state violence.\\nFarmers produce humanities’ most essential need and are not the ‘enemy within’. The spotlight should fall on the ‘enemy beyond’. Instead of depicting farmers as ‘anti-national’, as sections of the media and prominent commentators in India try to, the focus needs to be on challenging those interests that seek to gain from undermining India’s food security and sovereignty and the impoverishment of farmers.\\nNote: The issues discussed in the above article are set out in the author’s free-to-read book (2022), which can be accessed at Academia.edu and Global Research', 'source_domain': 'dissidentvoice.org', 'url': 'https://dissidentvoice.org/2024/02/farmers-protest-in-india-reignites-a-struggle-for-the-future-of-food-and-agriculture/'}\n"
