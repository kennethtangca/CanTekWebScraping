;;Why is a blatant scam depicting Michael Saylor asking for Bitcoin allowed to be shown as an advertisement on Youtube?;" Youtube is running advertisements that are blatant scams. I've ran into another one watching various youtube videos, and all essentially depict Michael Saylor going on about a new product or service being offered for Bitcoin. It uses a video of him in his chair and AI technology to depict his voice. They're about a minute long and essentially all the same. It's the age old ""send x amount of bitcoin and receive double the amount back. I thought seeing one was weird, but now I've seen a couple and thought I'd say something to bring awareness about this. I took a screenshot of what the advertisement looks like. https://imgur.com/gallery/o6XMq5f How does this even happen on youtube? Do they not do quality control of the advertisements that they put on their platform? The scam couldn't be anymore in your face, and I get you have to be pretty gullible to fall for it, but this is ridiculous. I just wanted to bring some attention to it, and apologize if it's been mentioned before. Bitcoin pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below.

I‚Äôve seen this scam ad along with ones for Cardano, XRP, and Solana. I report them each time but not sure google gives a flying fuck. Honestly, they should be held liable for anyone who becomes a victim. Will probably never happen, though. There's an ETH one with Vitalik as well. It's almost convincing due to the fact he's normally awkward as hell lol It‚Äôs actually so fucked how they‚Äôll de monetize creators for the smallest little infraction but let scam channels and ads run without any intervention. yt has long run ads that are blatant scams. AI has really stepped up to enable these scams too. YT needs to be taken to task for it. I never see such egregiously bad marketing on other platforms of similar size. FB had a time when they were pretty bad, but I've noticed the blatant scams are cut - or at least I don't see them anymore. Maybe YouTube should step up their AI game to detect these scam ads. I've seen them all too. XRP, ADA, then the new government stimulus scam ads too. It's at least 80% of ads. YouTube will take the advertising fee without vetting the company, and then once all the reports come in, they stop the advertisement and keep the money. The scammer don't care because they always make it back, then rinse and repeat We haven't even scratched the surface of this. Media companies better get on the fuckin ball right now. This is important. They NEED to have dedicated fact checking and digital analysis teams ready. The whole thing that Sorkin wrote about in ""The Newsroom"" Is already out of control and it's gonna get exponentially worse. We need something like the Fairness Doctrine in place again and other regulations on ""opinion/entertainment networks"" when it comes to labeling them news and making sure they aren't a part of the equal airtime thing We just had a post about an XRP scam a few days ago - that one was up for at least a month even though many users (me included) have reported it multiple times. The answer is: Youtube allows this as long as the advertisers pay. Scam is now part of their portfolio, or at least they told me clearly it's not breaking their ToS.

;;Michael Saylor scam ad;" Just saw a Saylor ad offering to give out free Bitcoin on YT. It‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs funny. His mouth is moving so unnaturally and it‚Äôs so poorly edited. He looks like a human rabbit and it looks like a 12 year old edited the scam ad. It‚Äôs unfortunate that Google looks the other way whenever a scam crypto commercial is reported on YT. Saw this too. Reported it but I'm sure YouTube allows these things deliberately. Spread more scam stories for bitcoin. I saw it and did the same, kinda clever to make it look live I thought. I really hope MicroStrategy complains to TY about the infringement I reported it and received a written statement within 24h, from the Google Trust & Safety-Team - their statement: this is against the Google policy and they took action‚Ä¶this was 4 days ago.. so it is back again? Saylor, Vitalik, Garlinghouse, Anatoli are all featured in these ""2 for 1"" advertisements on YT. I keep reporting these scam ads but nothing ever seems to happen. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen from the kind folks like yourself who take the time to report. Google doesn‚Äôt give two shits. Maybe someone getting scammed big money and suing Google will make them reassess. I see those a lot and report them. Excellent. Have you ever received any genuine response where they took it serious and said they investigate them? I‚Äôve seen some screen grabs where the Google rep said the ads reported didn‚Äôt violate any policy. Hopefully some Google reps will take it seriously and put forth an effort to remove/ban these. Unfortunately some naive and greedy people will be taken in. No one is going to send you back double your btc...that should be obvious to everyone, but it isn't. Google is pretty heavy handed with various censorship but are cool with scammers stealing not only crypto but the image of various finance and business folks without their permission(Saylor, Elon and Brad from xRP) Someone posted in this sub not too long ago after falling for this scam.

;;Michael Saylor Bitcoin Scam.;" I lost 2 Bitcoin! Don‚Äôt fall for it! They place banners and do voice overs on various interviews of Micheal Saylor found on YouTube. Last week they sent you to www.ms-give.com Yesterday they were at it again directing you to www.ms-net. If you have been scammed please go to the FBI sites IC3 and make a complaint. They will do nothing until they have enough complaints. I adore Michael Saylor and am so upset that they are using his name and content to steal our coins. God bless Bitcoin I was scammed a few months ago too when I first started out, its the worst feeling. Gotta keep spreading the word ‚Äúnobody is EVERRRRRR going go double your Bitcoin‚Äù if you see a giveaway its probably a scam. Exactly, also social media has been the most place for this. I have recently shut down a couple of requests like this on my Facebook and twitter after I got to know what's really going behind it.
Additionally, keep an eye on the network when making a transfer as I have seen, many have lost their precious money due to network issues. Isn't this a pattern in crypto scams? They lure you into some event or something like that on social media and in response ask you to deposit a small amount of crypto in their account for a giveaway or some hacks and that way they steal your money.

;;Fake Michael Saylor audio leak going around, hates bitcoin and loves Ethereum!; So a fake supposedly leak audio is going around the internet and is getting picked up and talked about from some youtubers and a little traction on twitter. From everything I've been able to read this is a fake AI generated audio clip of Saylor so don't go off selling your bitcoin just yet.          Pro & con info are in the collapsed comments below for the following topics: Bitcoin, Ethereum. Something on Twitter is fake?     You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and tell lies? Even if it isn't fake, I really wouldn't care. Lmao people can't be that gullible... right? Its so obviously fake. Imagine Michael Saylor buying whatever the fuck a pugy penguin is. If anyone believed this, they‚Äôre gonna get scammed out of their crypto real soon Bitcoin would be the last thing in this world that Michael Saylor would talk shit about.

;;What actually is Michael Saylor's bitcoin strategy?....;" ....being more specific than just saying he's accumulating as much bitcoin as he can. I Googled it but can only find pieces of it. he stepped down from ceo last year, but at the time he was the longest sitting ceo of a single corporation in wall st history. he‚Äôs shared stories of seeing ceos destroy companies by trying to beat inflation and stay profitable by buying companies, merging with companies, buying back stocks etc. when covid happened and the money printer went brrrrr he realized that no matter what he did, microstrategy was in a dire situation in that no matter how many hours he asked his employees to work or how many employees he hired, they could not keep making more profits to beat inflation since the money they earn and saved was being devalued. so he did a drastic move and went all in on bitcoin which cannot be manipulated or devalued. in today‚Äôs economic environment no one can beat inflation with their income alone, they need to take risks like invest in the stock market, buy real estate, have a side gig etc. corporations are in the same boat, they need to merge with other companies, buy other companies or buyback stocks etc. but as i explained those generally destroy corporations in the long run. so saylor‚Äôs strategy using his own metaphor is to stop fighting the wind of inflation by paddling harder and instead put up a sail (bitcoin) and harness the wind. bitcoin is volatile but as he says ‚Äúvolatility is vitality‚Äù meaning fiat is stable but is guaranteed to go to zero due to infinite printing whereas bitcoin is volatile but is guaranteed to go up in value due to it‚Äôs strictly limited supply. Is part of his strategy to issue more stock that is immediately sold to buy bitcoin? He‚Äôs also established MSTR as a better than ETF option for institutions that can‚Äôt legally buy BTC but want exposure to BTC; They buy his stock. His massive purchases of late are to fend off the actual ETF issuers. MSTR likely to take a haircut in its stock price when the ETFs hit. He wants to be able to give someone more exposure for less fees by just holding MSTR vs iBTC. I think it was a simple mathematical calculation for Michael. He calculated the true cost of capital was above 20% unlike what the government was claiming inflation was. He realized that if you're not making >20% APY then you are losing purchasing power. The only thing that has a chance of beating 20% is BTC. One thing no commenter has mentioned yet is that microstrategy is issuing shares of stock that people purchase in fiat and then MSTR is using that fiat to purchase Bitcoin. It‚Äôs basically the same concept if you taking out a personal loan to buy bitcoin and then paying off the loan when the bitcoin appreciates.  Buy and hold, because nothing will have a greater value than bitcoin. He believes it i do too maybe we are both fools, I dont think we are. It's funny because I'm rushing to put money into this system and I don't expect to even cash out. it's just exciting to know I'm contributing to a new and amazing prospect that could make the entire World a better place. 14% annualised growth per year hold them forever laura. his strategy is to help raise the price of btc so everyone benefits  ";www.reddit.com;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18t94ne/what_actually_is_michael_saylors_bitcoin_strategy/;

;;Michael Saylor warns of deepfake crypto scams involving MicroStrategy;English                                    The recent surge in cryptocurrency giveaway scams has raised concerns, particularly with the involvement of deepfake videos featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. These scams, utilizing AI-generated content, are prevalent on platforms such as YouTube and X, with notable personalities like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also becoming targets. Michael Saylor recently issued a warning after discovering fraudulent deepfake videos circulating on YouTube, falsely portraying him and MicroStrategy engaging in a Bitcoin giveaway. In these videos, the deepfake Saylor encourages viewers to send him Bitcoin, promising to double the amount. Saylor responded to this deceptive tactic by cautioning his followers, emphasizing the absence of a ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù in the cryptocurrency space. The misleading video not only promotes the fake giveaway. They also make audacious claims, including predicting that the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would drive the price of BTC to an astonishing $1 million. Those who click on the video link are directed to a scam website claiming to host the ‚Äúbiggest crypto giveaway,‚Äù boasting 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH up for grabs. The website employs urgency, urging immediate participation with limited spots available and no prerequisite crypto knowledge. The deceptive website outlines the event, promising participants a share of 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH, emphasizing exclusivity with the statement, ‚ÄúYou can only participate once!‚Äù The deepfake Saylor on the site encourages investors to scan a QR code, ostensibly leading to the giveaway. It is noteworthy that Michael Saylor recently disclosed plans to sell $216 million worth of MicroStrategy shares to bolster his Bitcoin holdings. While the exact amount of BTC he currently owns remains undisclosed, Saylor shared in October 2020 that he possesses 17,732 BTC. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, the software intelligence firm under Saylor‚Äôs leadership, publicly reported holdings of 189,150 bitcoins as of December 2023. The prevalence of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts underscores a growing trend in the misuse of AI-generated content. These scams exploit the trust and credibility associated with influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry to deceive unsuspecting individuals. Investors are urged to exercise caution and skepticism when confronted with sensational claims or promises of free cryptocurrency. The saying ‚Äúthere is no such thing as a free lunch‚Äù resonates particularly in the volatile and often deceptive realm of cryptocurrencies. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of verifying information, especially in an environment where misinformation and fraudulent schemes abound. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, so does the creativity of scammers seeking to exploit the enthusiasm surrounding these digital assets. The rise of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency investors, featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance within the community. Read More One of the largest international banks on the planet, Standard Chartered has recently predicted that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank stated those funds could be seen in 2024, following approval of the investment product. Industry experts have increased their expectations of the product‚Äôs approval in the coming days, with many expecting approval to arrive by Wednesday of this week. Moreover, Standard Chartered has forecasted a massive price increase for the digital asset following approval of the more than a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently contemplating. JUST IN: Standard Charter Bank says #Bitcoin could see $50-100 billion in spot ETF inflows upon approval in 2024. Also Read: Bitcoin: Standard Chartered Says ETF to Bring 165% Gain in 2024 For the last several months, anticipation over a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States has reached a fever pitch. The digital asset industry is anxiously awaiting a decision on the host of applications. Subsequently, many are predicting what such an approval could mean for the industry as a whole. Among them is Standard Chartered Bank, which says that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank notes that the inflows will be between $50 and $100 billion. Additionally, they expect a massive impact on the price over the next year. Also Read: All Spot Bitcoin ETF Applicants Submit S-1 Final Amendments The bank also noted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $200,000 by the end of 2025. Although it would certainly require the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, it would be a monumental increase. Subsequently, that mark would skyrocket past Bitcoin‚Äôs previous all-time high of $68,789. The expectation from those within the industry is that approval is set to arrive at some point this week. Standard Chartered noted that such an approval is imminent in their predictions.

;;Michael Saylor Issues Crucial Bitcoin (BTC) Warning;"Founder of MicroStrategy business intelligence giant Michael Saylor addressed the Bitcoin community, warning them about a new threat posed by the advancing development of artificial intelligence technologies. In the middle of December, a similar warning was made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. The MicroStrategy founder took to Twitter/X social media platform to share with his followers that his security team has been taking down deep-fake videos generated with the help of AI from YouTube. Those scam videos featured Saylor, Bitcoin trading and cryptocurrency giveaway scams every 15 minutes, per the Bitcoin evangelist. His tweet contained several ‚Äúwarning sign‚Äù emojis. He warned the community, saying ‚ÄúBe careful out there, and remember there is no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù The screenshots Saylor posted show ‚Äúhim‚Äù talking about the Bitcoin ETF likely to propel the Bitcoin price to the $1 million level. ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning‚ö†Ô∏è My security team has been taking down one AI generated deepfake video featuring me, @MicroStrategy, and #Bitcoin trading & giveaway scams on @YouTube every 15 minutes.

In December 2023, scammers armed with AI tools made videos with Charles Hoskinson, and now they have chosen Michael Saylor for this since he is a vocal Bitcoin evangelist and an outstanding figure in the world of business and finance. In the middle of December, Charles Hoskinson also commented on a tweet featuring a deep-fake video with him talking about a ‚ÄúCardano giveaway.‚Äù Hoskinson admitted that so far this video is imperfect and this is clearly visible; however, he believes that within the next two-three years, these AI-generated scam videos will become a lot more sophisticated and then hardly anyone will be able to tell reality from ‚ÄúAI fiction.‚Äù Many experts are expecting AI technologies to undergo a great deal of development within the next few years. Elon Musk, the founder of xAI and Grok chatbot, is among them. He believes that humanity is less than three years away from AI making new discoveries in physics, writing novels and generally from getting significantly better at anything humans are good at.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available. Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy who stepped down as the company CEO in August to focus on its further Bitcoin strategy and acquisitions, has engaged himself in a debate with Swedish researcher and current CIO of Arcane Assets fund Eric Wall regarding the Bitcoin Lightning Network. As part of it, Saylor decided to give away some Bitcoin. Eric Wall created a public poll on his Twitter page to pick his followers' brains to see if they believe the former chief of MicroStrategy has ever made more than three transactions using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Saylor responded ""yes"" to that and promised to make ""three more transactions,"" each carrying 1,000,000 Satoshis, to three people who post memes about the Lightning Network in the comments to the tweet and who get the biggest amount of likes. The correct answer is Yes, and I will make three more transactions of 1,000,000 sats each to the 3 posters of the most liked #Lightning‚ö°Ô∏è memes in the comments below. https://t.co/qXZ90q4Ly9 This trolling of Saylor by Arcane Assets CIO began, apparently, after Saylor announced that MicroStrategy had begun developing its own SaaS (software as a service) based on Bitcoin Lightning Network in order to provide enterprises with solutions to enable new e-commerce use cases. In the comment thread, Wall continued making fun of Saylor, launching a Twitter poll that suggested that the aforementioned post about the BTC giveaway was published by Saylor's assistant.   Despite the fact that Saylor quit his position as chief executive, he remains in the company as an executive chairman. The position of CEO has been passed to Phong Le, who has been the company's president since 2020. Michael Saylor will now focus more on the firm's Bitcoin acquisition strategies and products based on the flagship cryptocurrency and, as we see from the said debate, on Bitcoin Lightning Network. Presently, MicroStrategy holds approximately 130,000 Bitcoins ‚Äì it has been buying BTC since August 2020 ‚Äì and is the company with the biggest amount of BTC on its balance sheet. This sum of BTC is worth roughly $3.9 billion at the time of writing. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed here are not investment advice; they are provided for informational purposes only.

;;The Giveaway Scams are Still Going: Using Microstrategy CEO to Steal From Hopeful Hodlers;A new giveaway scam has just launched and is reeling in a few unsuspecting people, so once again, we remind our reader to be vigilant and not to fall for these. Table of Contents This time its the website https://bitcoin22.io/ and according to details on the site, each hodler of the digital asset has a chance to receive extra amount of Bitcoin by joining the giveaway. The site also includes a portrait of Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor as well as the brand emblem to make it more trustworthy. In November 2021, the figure of the CEO of Microstrategy was used for a Bitcoin scam. An impersonator of Michael Saylor took more than $4 million from victims in a gifting scam. The format of that scam seemed similar and the tagline showed less difference: ‚Äú Hurry up and take part in the giveaway of 5000 BTC.‚Äù The only difference is the amount promised. Despite the fact that Bitcoin‚Äôs global adoption has increased in recent years, there are still a lot of roadblocks in the way of public acceptance. Unlike traditional money transactions, which must go through an intermediary and incur various service fees, Bitcoin transactions can be made directly between participants at no cost. The unusual behavior has resulted in civil, commercial, and criminal lawsuits based on fraud and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in actual money. Scammers frequently imitate celebrities, such as Michael Saylor, and then request that the user donate bitcoins to a certain address. To generate trust, they offer to quadruple the amount of cryptocurrency that investors deposit. MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO, Saylor, is a huge advocate of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has purchased up to 114,042 BTC since August, making it the highest Bitcoin holding of any publicly traded business. At current market prices, the holdings are worth more than $6.57 billion. Scammers have imitated Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as well as government institutions and well-known businesses, in addition to Saylor. Around May 2021, cyber thieves took more than $2 million in bogus presents tied to Musk, according to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The scam involving the Indian Prime Minister‚Äôs Twitter account, which occurred on December 12 of last year, is particularly significant. Hackers gained access to Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs Twitter account, saying that India had purchased a big amount of bitcoin and was distributing it to citizens across the country. A fraudulent link was attached by the hackers. With over 73 million followers on Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular incumbent politician. His Twitter announcement drew a lot of attention and was swiftly deleted. The incident occurred on December 12th, as India moves to stifle burgeoning cryptocurrency trading with a new law expected to be introduced in parliament this month. The Prime Minister‚Äôs account had been hacked for a short time, according to the regulatory agency, but Twitter had returned access to him. This is the second time Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs social account has been hacked under cyber attack. Last year, his other Twitter account was also hijacked and sent a tweet urging the public to donate to a fake Covid-19 relief fund. In recent years, cryptocurrency fraud has risen substantially. The business appears to have succumbed to its own success, as fraud cases are often linked to the rapid rise in digital asset prices. Nicholas Say was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Crypto tracking tool Whale Alert reported the incident on Nov. 21. It said the theft occurred via the website mstrategy.io/bit, a ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù scam platform used by con artists to impersonate Saylor. BeInCrypto attempted to access the website but received an error message. The fraudsters typically pose as a celebrity, in this case Michael Saylor, before asking users to send bitcoin to a designated address. They promise to multiply the cryptocurrency that investors send ‚Äì the giveaway ‚Äì but make off with the money instead. This time, a BTC user lost $179,000 to the scammers. At the time of writing, the primary bitcoin address in question received more than $4.16 million, or 72.14 BTC, in total, from 49 transactions. The current value of the address is $590,000 or 16.7 BTC. Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies. Since August last year, MicroStrategy has bought up to 114,042 BTC ‚Äì the largest holding of any publicly-traded company. The holdings are worth over $6.57 billion at current market prices. Scammers aren‚Äôt only pretending to be Saylor. They also impersonate Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as government agencies or well-known businesses. In the instance of Musk, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that online criminals stole more than $2 million in fake giveaways related to the influential billionaire during the six months to May 2021. Crypto fraud has risen sharply in recent years. The industry appears to have become a victim of its own success, as incidents of fraud tend to be linked to the exponential growth in digital asset prices. In 2020, crypto fraudsters targeted Twitter and took over high-profile accounts on the social media platform, including that of Musk. The scammers made off with over $120,000 in bitcoin from the hack. Open account on KuCoin & get a guaranteed bonus up to 700 USDT.

;;Michael Saylor Claims Will Continue to Buy Bitcoin;"Source : Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash

Michael Saylor, one of the founders of MicroStrategy, stated that he will not sell Bitcoin and will continue to buy it.
 
In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, Michael Saylor was asked if his company would sell the 190,000 BTC it holds.


Saylor confidently responded that he and his company will always buy Bitcoin and referred to Bitcoin as an exit strategy.

""I will buy that asset (Bitcoin) forever. Bitcoin is the exit strategy; it is the strongest asset, so what we are seeing now is Bitcoin emerging as a trillion-dollar asset class. And it sits alongside names like Apple, Google, and Microsoft,"" Saylor emphasized.

Saylor views Bitcoin as an asset that is inherently ""superior,"" surpassing even established giants like gold and the S&P 500.

This strong conviction has driven MicroStrategy's recent transformation into a ""Bitcoin Development Company,"" demonstrating their dedication to developing the digital currency ecosystem. Source: Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash
In the interview, Saylor also mentioned that the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US has opened the floodgates for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem, with demand outstripping current supply.

Saylor also dismissed concerns that the ETF would make it difficult for MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin, stating that they use ""operational leverage strategy"" to invest in digital assets.
""If you look at what the ETFs are doing, they are facilitating the transformation of digital capital. And every day, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital flow from the traditional analog ecosystem to the digital economy,"" he said.

As a leading Bitcoin holder since 2020, MicroStrategy has amassed over 190,000 BTC, with an average purchase price of $31,224, making MicroStrategy's total investment cost $5.93 billion.

Last year, despite increasing losses, MicroStrategy continued to buy Bitcoin. In January, Saylor sold $216 million in MicroStrategy private stock options to buy more Bitcoin.

As of February, with the price of Bitcoin at $50,000, MicroStrategy is in a profitable position with an investment value of approximately $10 billion.  This content aims to enrich reader information.

Cointelegraph
Follow Michael Saylor has no plans to sell Bitcoin, even as the holdings of his company MicroStrategy have swelled to reach an unrealized profit just shy of $4 billion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever. Bitcoin is the exit strategy,‚Äù Saylor said, speaking to Bloomberg on Feb. 20 when asked if his firm would sell its 190,000 BTC stash ‚Äî worth around $9.88 billion at current prices. Outlining his bullish case for Bitcoin (BTC $51,372), Saylor claimed the cryptocurrency is ‚Äútechnically superior‚Äù to gold, the S&P 500 and real estate, despite each asset class having a far greater market capitalization than Bitcoin‚Äôs $1 trillion. ‚ÄúWe believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes. And that being the case, there‚Äôs just no reason to sell the winner to buy the losers.‚Äù MicroStrategy ‚Äî a business intelligence software firm ‚Äî became the first publicly traded company to start scooping up Bitcoin in 2020. The 190,000 BTC it held as of the fourth quarter of 2023 cost an average of $31,224 each, bringing MicroStrategy‚Äôs total investment cost to $5.93 billion. United States-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hold an estimated 270,000 BTC as of Friday, Feb. 16, according to HODL15Capital data. Saylor said the demand for Bitcoin, generated by a growing appetite for ETF products, ‚Äúhas been far in excess of the supply from the miners,‚Äù sometimes up to ‚Äú10 times as much.‚Äù However, he brushed off concerns that the ETFs would make it harder for MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin, saying it employs a ‚Äúlevered operating strategy‚Äù for investment in the digital asset. ‚ÄúThe spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre facilitating the digital transformation of capital, and every day, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a rising tide. It‚Äôs going to lift all boats,‚Äù he said. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

;;Michael Saylor Says There Is No Reason to Sell Bitcoin Anytime Soon;"MicroStrategy executive chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor says there is no reason to sell any of his Bitcoin anytime soon, in an interview with Bloomberg‚Äôs Katie Greifeld on Tuesday. Saylor said the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETFs is a rising tide that is going to lift all boats ‚Äì this phrase is metaphorically associated with the idea that as the market improves this will benefit all participants. ‚ÄúBut if you look at what the spot ETFs are doing ‚Äì they are facilitating the digital transformation of capital and every day hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analogue ecosystem into the digital economy,‚Äù adds Saylor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever,‚Äù adding  ‚ÄúBitcoin, is the exit strategy,‚Äù  Saylor told Bloomberg. The MicroStrategy chairman is making his rounds in the media and was recently quoted saying there is over a decade of pent-up demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, in an interview with CNBC. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs 10 years of pent-up demand people been waiting for these ETFs and finally, mainstream investors are able to access Bitcoin and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the surge of capital in the asset class,‚Äù said Saylor. The MicroStrategy chairman discussed the state of the crypto industry, the rollout of bitcoin ETFs, bitcoin‚Äôs climbing valuation, and future plans. In the interview, Saylor also explained that MicroStrategy will be rebranding as a Bitcoin development company. He explained, that the rebrand was a natural decision due to the company‚Äôs success in its Bitcoin strategy and unique status as the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted plans to develop software, generate cash flow, and leverage the capital markets to accumulate more Bitcoin for shareholders and promote the growth of the Bitcoin network. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin investment has soared beyond the $10 billion mark, owning over 190,000 BTC as Bitcoin‚Äôs value climbs past $50,000. This achievement underscores MicroStrategy‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects and its utility as an inflation hedge, writes Arslan Butt from Cryptonews. Since joining the Bitcoin market in August 2020, MicroStrategy‚Äôs BTC portfolio has expanded significantly, even amidst the bear market‚Äôs challenges in early 2022. Despite experiencing a downturn in its fourth-quarter revenue and profit, MicroStrategy, under Michael Saylor‚Äôs leadership, continued to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, purchasing an additional 850 BTC for $37.2 million in January alone.

;;Michael Saylor Issues Critical Warning to BTC Holders;     U.Today - Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy chairman, a leading business intelligence company and one of the largest Bitcoin holders, has issued a crucial warning to the Bitcoin community. He revealed that his security team has been taking down deep-fake videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) that feature him promoting Bitcoin scams. Saylor revealed that his team pulls down roughly 80 fake AI-generated YouTube videos every day, but scammers continue to create more. The MicroStrategy chairman took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his worry and warn the crypto community about fake podcasts urging users to scan a barcode and send Bitcoin to receive double the amount back. These are typical Bitcoin scam tactics that aim to deceive and steal from unsuspecting victims. In this light, Saylor warns BTC holders that there is no risk-free way to double their Bitcoin, and MicroStrategy does not give away BTC to those who scan a barcode. He also urges them to always verify and not blindly trust. Saylor is not the only renowned crypto personality to be targeted by AI scammers. In November 2023, deep-fake videos of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse promoting fake XRP giveaways emerged on social media. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sophisticated and quickly expanding technology that can generate realistic and convincing digital content such as photos, videos, audio and text. While artificial intelligence has many positive and beneficial applications, it can also be used for malicious purposes. The crypto community should be aware of the possible risks posed by AI and take action to safeguard their holdings. Some of the best practices for avoiding AI scams include verifying the source and authenticity of any information or offer related to crypto before taking any action. They should also never send crypto to unknown or untrusted addresses or platforms, especially if they promise unrealistic returns or rewards.

;;Bitcoin User Loses Record $1.1M in Scam Michael Saylor Giveaway;"We use cookies to improve your experience.   A bitcoin user on Saturday lost $1.14 million to online thieves posing as MicroStrategy chief executive officer Michael Saylor. The user sent the equivalent of 26.4 bitcoins (BTC) to an address confirmed by crypto tracking service Whale Alert as a bitcoin scam. A nightmare come true, Whale Alert said, ‚Äúthis scam received the single largest payment ever to a fake giveaway.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe suspect this payment was made through a Coinbase address,‚Äù added the outfit, famous for tracking large-scale bitcoin transactions. It said the theft occurred via this website and on YouTube, both ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù scam platforms used by con-artists to impersonate Saylor. The YouTube channel has since been taken down, and a visit to the website returns an error message. The 26.4 BTC was sent to the primary scam address in five transactions, according to a record of the payments. The loot is worth $1.14 million at current market prices. The giveaway scam uses the identities of celebrities such as Michael Saylor in order to trick people into sending them bitcoin. They promise to multiply the crypto that investors send ‚Äì the giveaway ‚Äì but make off with the money instead. Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a big supporter of bitcoin. Since August 2020, his company bought 124,391 BTC ‚Äî the largest holding of any publicly-traded entity. The holdings are currently valued at $5.39 billion. Open account on KuCoin & get a guaranteed bonus up to 700 USDT. Responding to the Whale Alert announcement, Saylor said: [At least] 489 of these scams were launched on YouTube last week. We report them every 15 minutes and they are taken down after a few hours, but the scammers just launch more. This is the latest fake giveaway involving Saylor. In November, someone sent nearly 3 BTC ($179,000), to a different giveaway impersonating the MicroStrategy head. Scammers aren‚Äôt only pretending to be Saylor. They also impersonate Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as government agencies or well-known businesses. Whale Alert said in a 2020 report that cybercriminals are finding it very easy to fool people of their bitcoin because their schemes have become believably professional and aggressive. After analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points, it concluded that ‚Äúcrypto crime pays. A lot.‚Äù This is mainly because the bitcoin scam business is almost risk-free, as perpetrators have an extremely low chance of getting caught. Whale Alert says it tracks 9,214 scam websites and 92,955 fraudulent crypto addresses. To date, it has tracked over $803 million in stolen digital assets worldwide.

;;MICHAEL SAYLOR IMPERSONATED TO RUN GIVEAWAY SCAM;"TL;DR Breakdown Chief Executive Officer of Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy‚Äô Michael Saylor has been impersonated to run a fake crypto giveaway scam. They garnered over $1m in Bitcoin with the operation. The scam comes in the wake of many others that have become a threat to the crypto industry. Perpetrators pretend to be a famous person from the community and offer to double all BTC that users send to their wallets. Afterward, all BTC that is transferred to the scammers‚Äô addresses are lost, and the victim does not receive anything in return. As funny and cheap as giveaway scams sound, people continue to fall victim quite frequently in the hope of getting free money. Michael Saylor, whose company owns the most BTC and a personal HODLer himself, is frequently impersonated. His impersonation was revealed during the weekend as Whale Alert reported one address confirmed to be a Saylor-impersonating scam. Although it has been active for less than a month (January only), the wallet has attracted more than $1.1 million worth of bitcoin, reflecting how dangerous the scam could be. Saylor himself eventually commented on Whale Alert‚Äôs post later on, indicating that nearly 500 such scams went live on YouTube in just one week. 489 of these scams were launched on YouTube last week. We report them every 15 minutes and they are taken down after a few hours, but the scammers just launch more‚Ä¶ He said his team continues to report them ‚Äúevery 15 minutes, and they are taken down after a few hours,‚Äù but they continue to pop up frequently. Cryptocurrency giveaway scams have been a problem for those involved in the crypto-community since the last major bull run in late 2017. Giveaway scams are a form of social engineering in which a scammer attempts to deceive a cryptocurrency investor into believing that a major cryptocurrency exchange or celebrity is hosting a giveaway. The catch here is that in order to participate in the giveaway, you must first send a certain amount of cryptocurrency to a giveaway address so that you can verify your wallet address and receive your share of the giveaway.

;;Michael J. Saylor;"Michael J. Saylor (born February 4, 1965) is an American entrepreneur and business executive. He is the executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services. Saylor was MicroStrategy's chief executive officer from 1989 to 2022. He authored the 2012 book The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. He is also the sole trustee of Saylor Academy, a provider of free online education. As of 2016, Saylor had been granted 31 patents and had 9 additional applications under review.[2] Saylor is an advocate of Bitcoin, stating that he believes it will replace gold as the global store-of-value asset.[3][4] Saylor was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on February 4, 1965, and spent his early years on various Air Force bases around the world, as his father was an Air Force chief master sergeant. When Saylor was 11, the family settled in Fairborn, Ohio, near the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.[5][6] In 1983, Saylor enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an Air Force ROTC scholarship.[5][6] He joined the Theta Delta Chi fraternity, through which he met the future co-founder of MicroStrategy, Sanju Bansal.[6][7] He graduated from MIT in 1987, with a double major in aeronautics and astronautics; and science, technology, and society. A medical condition prevented him from becoming a pilot,[5][6] and instead, he got a job with a consulting firm, The Federal Group, Inc. in 1987, where he focused on computer simulation modeling for a software integration company.[7] In 1988, Saylor became an internal consultant at DuPont, where he developed computer models to help the company anticipate change in its key markets. The simulations predicted that there would be a recession in many of DuPont's major markets in 1990.[5][7] Using the funds from DuPont, Saylor founded MicroStrategy with Sanju Bansal, his MIT fraternity brother.[6] The company began developing software for data mining, then focused on software for business intelligence. In 1992, MicroStrategy won a $10 million contract with McDonald's to develop applications to analyze the efficiency of its promotions. The contract with McDonald's led Saylor to realize that his company could create business intelligence software that would allow companies to use their data for insights into their businesses.[6][7][5][8][9] Saylor took the company public in June 1998, with an initial stock offering of 4 million shares priced at $12 each.[10] The stock price doubled on the first day of trading.[11] By early 2000, Saylor's net worth reached $7 billion, and the Washingtonian reported that he was the wealthiest man in the Washington D.C. area.[5] In 1996, Saylor was named KPMG Washington High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year.[7][12] In 1997, Ernst & Young named Saylor its Software Entrepreneur of the Year, and the following year, Red Herring Magazine recognized him as one of its Top 10 Entrepreneurs for 1998.[13] Saylor was also featured by the MIT Technology Review as an ""Innovator Under 35"" in 1999.[14] On August 8, 2022, Saylor resigned as CEO and remained executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Phong Le, the company's president, succeeded him as CEO. Saylor said in a press release, ""As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.""[15] As of 2023, he owns 2,407,408 shares, about 18.1% of the total outstanding, and has 64.7% of the voting power.[16] In March 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought charges against Saylor and two other MicroStrategy executives for the company's inaccurate reporting of financial results for the preceding two years.[17] In December 2000, Saylor settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by paying $350,000 in penalties and a personal disgorgement of $8.3 million.[18][19][20] As a result of the restatement of results, the company's stock declined in value and Saylor's net worth fell by $6 billion.[21][22] In a 3,000-word memo to all MicroStrategy employees on March 16, 2020, entitled ""My Thoughts on COVID-19,"" Saylor criticized countermeasures then being recommended against the disease, saying that it is ""soul-stealing and debillitating [sic] to embrace the notion of social distancing & economic hibernation"" and predicting that in the worst-case scenario, global life expectancy would only ""click down by a few weeks."" Saylor also refused to close MicroStrategy's offices unless he was legally required to do so. The full content of the memo appeared on Reddit for only a few minutes and was reposted in the Washington Business Journal.[23][24] On MicroStrategy's quarterly earnings conference call in July 2020, Saylor announced his intention for MicroStrategy to explore purchasing Bitcoin, gold, or other alternative assets instead of holding cash. The following month, MicroStrategy used $250 million from its cash stockpile to purchase 21,454 Bitcoin.[25] MicroStrategy later added $175 million of Bitcoin to its holdings in September 2020 and another $50 million in early December 2020. On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it had sold $650 million in convertible senior notes, taking on debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion worth. On December 21, 2020, MicroStrategy announced their total holdings include 70,470 bitcoins purchased for $1.125 billion at an average price of $15,964 per bitcoin.[26] As of February 24, 2021 holdings include 90,531 bitcoins acquired for $2.171 billion at an average price of $23,985 per bitcoin.[27] Saylor, who controls 70% of MicroStrategy's shares, dismissed concerns by observers that the move is turning MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin investment firm or exchange-traded fund (ETF).[28] In October 2020, Saylor disclosed he personally held 17,732 bitcoin at an average purchase price of $9,882. As of October 2021, he had not sold any bitcoin.[29] Between October 1 and November 29, 2021, MicroStrategy bought 7,002 bitcoins for about $414.4 million in cash at an average purchase price of $59,187, bringing its total holdings to 121,044 bitcoins.[30][31] Through April 2023, Microstrategy has purchased 140,000 bitcoin for an average price of $29,803.[32] In August 2022, Saylor resigned as CEO, remaining as executive chairman, to focus more on bitcoin.[33] On August 31, 2022, the Attorney General for the District of Columbia sued Saylor for tax fraud, accusing him of illegally avoiding more than $25 million in D.C. taxes by pretending to be a resident of other jurisdictions. MicroStrategy was accused of collaborating with Saylor to facilitate his tax evasion by misreporting his residential address to local and federal tax authorities and failing to withhold D.C. taxes.[34] Saylor issued a statement saying: ""I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.""[35] In June 2012, Saylor released The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything, published by Perseus Books, which discusses trends in mobile technology and their future impact on commerce, healthcare, education, and the developing world.[36] The book appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list, where it was ranked number seven in hardcover non-fiction books in August 2012,[37] and was ranked number five in hardcover business books on the Wall Street Journal's Best-Sellers list in July 2012.[38] In 1999, Saylor established The Saylor Foundation (later named Saylor Academy), of which he is the sole trustee. Saylor.org was launched in 2008 as the free education initiative of The Saylor Foundation.[39] ";en.wikipedia.org;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor;
;;‚ÄúMicrostrategy On Top‚Äù: Michael Saylor On Bitcoin Strategy In Long Term;  Sign up Sign in Michael J. Saylor Follow --   Hours after stepping down from the role of CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor made interesting comments on the company‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy. He tweeted earlier that in his next job, Saylor‚Äôs focus would be more on Bitcoin. He also stated that Micrstrategy had greatly benefited from adopting a Bitcoin strategy two years ago. ‚ÄúSince adopting a Bitcoin Strategy, Microstrategy has outperformed every asset class and big tech stock.‚Äù Microstrategy former chief executive officer Michael Saylor said the company‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy helped it weather the financial storm of currency devaluations. The strategy also helped the company with an increased visibility to great extent and also financial flexibility, he added. ‚ÄúVolatility is vitality.‚Äù Saylor said the volatility in crypto markets could reduce gradually in the next four to eight years. He made a direct correlation between volatility in crypto and clarity in regulatory issues pertaining to the digital assets ecosystem. The volatility would also depend on the awareness of crypto in the market, he added. Saylor said the company‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy has put it right up along big techs like Microsoft and SAP in terms of volatility. He added that the Bitcoin part of Microstrategy‚Äôs operations is in fact a benefit in that it helps in marketing and sales. Overall, the Bitcoin strategy is a net positive for Microstrategy‚Äòs enterprise software business, he explained. The Bitcoin maverick also responded on the new senate proposal that gives the CFTC oversight on policing Bitcoin and Ethereum. ‚ÄúEverybody in the world wants digital property. Every regulator would be interested in the crypto ecosystem. A set of regulations is going to be good for the crypto industry.‚Äù Saylor stressed on the importance of regulation in bringing in big institutional investors to the crypto industry. There are many big investors who are afraid to invest in crypto until they understand the rules of the road, he said. ‚ÄúAs the regulators sort out the rules and provide clarity, it will be great for Bitcoin.‚Äù Speaking on Microstrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy going forward, he said executives across the company are unanimously committed to it. On many instances in the past, Saylor said Bitcoin would achieve phenomenal success in the long term. ‚ÄúAs long as the price of Bitcoin does not get to zero, it will get to a million,‚Äù said Saylor in June. He believes in Bitcoin reaching a huge upward price movement in long term and is often vocal about it. Distraction-free reading. No ads. Organize your knowledge with lists and highlights.

;;Michael Saylor Warns Public: Avoid Scams Promising Free MicroStrategy Bitcoin;             Michael Saylor, the tech titan synonymous with Bitcoin and his massive holdings at MicroStrategy, has issued a warning: the cryptocurrency world is awash in scams, and your beloved Bitcoin might be at risk. Saylor‚Äôs stark revelation comes from the frontline of the battle against fraud. His team, a tireless digital janitorial squad, mops up an astonishing 80 fake YouTube videos every day, each one a meticulously crafted trap for unsuspecting investors. These nefarious schemes, often masquerading as free Bitcoin giveaways or quick-flip money doublers, exploit the names of industry giants like Saylor and MicroStrategy to lend themselves an air of legitimacy. But behind the mask lies a grim reality. Scammers leverage the allure of easy riches and prey on the excitement surrounding recent events like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their tactics are diverse, ranging from enticing ‚Äúengagement rewards‚Äù that lure victims into sending away their crypto to blatantly fake giveaways promising mountains of BTC in exchange for a simple scan of a QR code. ?? Warning ?? There is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn‚Äôt give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode. My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated @YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don‚Äôt trust, verify. JuiceStorm.com/gqZkQW02Ji ‚Äî Michael Saylor?? (@saylor) January 13, 2024 ‚ÄúThere is no risk-free way to double your Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor cautions. This golden rule, often lost in the frenzy of the cryptosphere, should resonate with every investor. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. MicroStrategy, with its record-breaking Bitcoin reserves, makes a particularly juicy target for these digital grifters. Saylor points out that his company‚Äôs reputation is constantly being hijacked to lend credibility to elaborate scams. This underscores the need for extreme caution, especially when encountering offers involving prominent figures or companies in the space. But the threat extends beyond MicroStrategy. The arrival of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, much anticipated by the industry, has Saylor worried about an impending wave of new scams. With the influx of non-crypto-native investors eager to jump on the bandwagon, scammers will have a fresh pool of potential victims to exploit. Michael Saylor isn‚Äôt the only one raising the alarm. The Ripple ecosystem, long plagued by scam accusations, has further fueled concerns about YouTube‚Äôs role in hosting and allowing these illicit activities to flourish. The platform‚Äôs lax approach to policing its content has drawn sharp criticism, leaving many to wonder if enough is being done to protect investors.

On Jan. 9, United States law enforcement officials warned that generative AI tools can lower the technical barrier of entry for would-be scammers.

;;Breaking: MicroStrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor Might Be Selling Bitcoins At Your Back;      TRENDING TODAY All that we have been hearing over the last two years is that MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has been aggressively buying Bitcoins. However, a contrary report suggests that Mr. Saylor might be dumping his thousands of Bitcoins at your back. Bitcoin critic Mr. Whale published a detailed report saying Saylor has been selling his BTC for months while urging others to ‚Äútake out double mortgages and go all-in‚Äù. Mr. Whale digs into the past of Michael Saylor wherein he compares his investment failures of the dot-com bubble of the late 90s. Citing an article from the Fortune Magazine, Mr. Whale says that Saylor lost a whopping $13.5 billion back then, the most by any individual. Mr. whale writes: His investment failures came from years of negligent accounting practices, fraud, and overall terrible leadership. It‚Äôs clear his companies valuation is solely based on his ability to attract hype by engaging in popular ‚Äútrends‚Äù, which we saw with their eagerness to be at the center of the dot-com bubble, and now with the Bitcoin bubble. Later in 2000, the U.S. SEC also accused him of fraud. As a result, Saylor had to pay $350,000 as a penalty to the SEC and $8.3 million to shareholders. Mr. Whale digs into some of the old tweets by Michael Saylor wherein he has criticized Bitcoin. In some of his very old tweets, Saylor wrote that ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äôs days are numbered‚Äù and that it doesn‚Äôt hold any intrinsic value. Mr. Whale accuses Saylor of creating the Bitcoin hype and attracting investors into buying BTC and his company‚Äôs stock. He further adds that Michael Saylor and his company‚Äôs insiders could dump the stock at extremely overvalued prices. Mr. whale says that Saylor is playing theatrics with his assuring words that he has ‚Äúno plans to sell Bitcoin in the next 100 years‚Äù. Instead, the Microstrategy CEO has an exit plan in place. Furthermore, the whistleblower also accused Saylor of swaying people to buy BTC in September 2021. Mr. Whale said that it was an attempt from Saylor to gather enough liquidity to dump their own holdings. The whistleblower writes: Back in September 2021, I warned investors that Michael Saylor was secretly dumping his shares. This week, it was confirmed to be true. Michael Saylor has transferred his BTC to a secondary address that has been using Coinbase and Okex to sell bitcoins. He says that Saylor‚Äôs company MicroStrategy sold $63 million worth of BTC while announcing its purchase. ‚ÄúMicrostrategy has dumped over 8000+ Bitcoin. I expect them to dump more in the coming months. Be careful out there bulls,‚Äù he writes.

In November 2023, fake videos of Ripple and its chief Brad Garlinhouse surfaced with fake XRP giveaways. Similarly, Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson fell victim to deepfake in December, which followed an immediate warning from him on the increasing sophistication of these fake videos.

A UCL report said that experts have ranked manipulated video/audio as the most worrying use of artificial intelligence in terms of its applications for crime. Matt Groh, a research assistant with the Affective Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab, said that people can defend themselves against falling victim to deepfakes, by using their own intellect. ‚ÄúYou have to be a little skeptical, you have to double-check and be thoughtful,‚Äù Groh said.

The summit is gathering the most influential people focused on public policy for digital asset and blockchain innovations, according to the organizers. , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- MicroStrategy Inc. Chief Executive Michael Saylor told investors not to worry about a potential margin call on a Bitcoin-backed loan, saying the company has ample collateral to pledge if necessary.  ‚ÄúAs long as the Silvergate loan remains collateralized with an LTV less than 50%, there is no margin call,‚Äù Saylor wrote in a email to Bloomberg, referring to loan-to-value metrics. ‚ÄúWe manage accordingly.‚Äù The software firm said on a conference call in May that the price of the Bitcoin would need to fall to around $21,000 before a call would be triggered on its $205 million loan from a unit of Silvergate Bank, but that it may contribute more to the collateral package so it never gets there. Bitcoin was trading around $22,500 Tuesday after dipping as low as $20,800 earlier in the session. ‚ÄúWhen @MicroStrategy adopted a #Bitcoin Strategy, it anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to #HODL through adversity,‚Äù Saylor tweeted earlier in the day. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer also said the company should have plenty of Bitcoin to meet any margin call as the firm has more than 95,000 Bitcoins to post as collateral. The firm is required to maintain a loan-to-collateral ratio of 50% or less and has at least $410 million worth of Bitcoin in a custody account. ‚ÄúThere is no liquidation provision here,‚Äù Palmer said in a phone interview, also noting there is a ‚Äúvast amount of confusion‚Äù over the loan agreement.  The company has about $2.2 billion in debt, roughly $44 million in annual interest expenses and is expected to generate $90 million of free cash flow in 2022, Palmer added. MicroStrategy‚Äôs 6.125% notes due in 2028 last traded at about 80 cents on the dollar, according to Trace bond trading data.

The announcement follows the filing of a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing reports that the purchases were made between October 1, 2021 and November 29, 2021, and continues the plan Saylor has been communicating for months. In June, MicroStrategy announced that it would be selling debt to purchase more bitcoin. The company added $243 million worth of bitcoin in September, bringing its total bitcoin buys for the third quarter to 8,957 bitcoins. The latest SEC filing, notes that a June 14, 2021 Open Market Sale Agreement, with Jefferies LLC as agent, enabled MicroStrategy to issue and sell shares of its class A common stock, and that it had indeed sold an aggregate of 571,001 shares in the past two months, at an average gross price per share of approximately $732.16, generating net proceeds of approximately $414.4 million ‚Äî the same amount used to purchase the new bitcoins. As of today, November 29, 2021, the public company, already the largest such corporate holder of bitcoin, touts an astronomical 121,044 bitcoins on its balance sheet. Saylor reports that these were acquired for approximately $3.57 billion at an average price of around $29,534 per bitcoin, which would put the present value of the BTC at more than $6.9 billion today.

;;;"Bitcoin billionaire and MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor says that we can bet on Bitcoin eventually reaching an 8 figure price tag. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Saylor speaks on the need for competition in the Bitcoin industry, such as for wallets, exchanges, securities and mining. But the billionaire also notes that with such a high failure rate of new enterprises, businesses hoping to succeed in the ecosystem have to be fully bullish on Bitcoin, and keep BTC as a hedge against their own failure. ""If you're mining Bitcoin, you never want to sell any Bitcoin, and if you raised money, you want to buy Bitcoin with the money you raise and then you want to borrow against the Bitcoin to pay the operating expenses. If you do that, if you believe in Bitcoin it's obvious. If you don't believe in Bitcoin maybe you shouldn't be in the business... If you don't think Bitcoin is going to $1,000,000 a coin and then $10,000,000 a coin, I don't think you should be a Bitcoin miner, I don't think you should be a Bitcoin exchange, I don't think you should be Bitcoin wallet... If you think it's not going to zero, then rational thinking is 'the competition in the market is making my Bitcoin more valuable, that's good. But the competition is making my existing business less profitable, that's bad. If I'm a genius and I execute well, maybe I can stay ahead of everybody else. Maybe. But while I'm doing that, every single free dollar I can raise I should be converting to Bitcoin, because out of a hundred possibilities, there's 99 paths where you fail and Bitcoin succeeds, and there's one path where you succeed and Bitcoin succeeds."" Saylor practices what he preaches. At the time of writing, business intelligence giant MicroStrategy has the largest known corporate treasury of Bitcoin. According to bitcointreasuries.com, MicroStrategy owns 114,042 Bitcoin. The company's Satoshi stack is worth over $6.5 billion, and comprises of about 0.54% of the 21 million in existence. Saylor started hoarding BTC for MicroStrategy in August of 2020 when BTC was roughly $10,000. Since then, there have been multiple additional purchases, much of them finance by debt offerings. The CEO says he grows more confident in the move as time goes by. ""I thought was a good idea in August of 2020, there's every single month for the past 13 months there have been fundamental developments in the space that have made it a better idea. Every single month, every week I almost see a new development that makes the network stronger, smarter, faster, harder. It makes it more anti-fragile... It becomes clearer and clearer that this is the future of digital property, this is digital energy...""  This site contains affiliate links to products/services.

;;;" Has he been margin called? Dollar cost averaging if you do not have access to a lot of capital or using BTC as an alternative to stock buybacks and acquisitions is a near perfect strategy for any individual that wants to make a tech investment or any tech company owner. I expect Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to join Elon Musk. It makes perfect sense for their companies too but I expect anouncements will come when they are ready.

A train wreck in the making.               You're a kid. Your parents fulfill all your demands. You feel you can get anything by just WANTING. You grow up, get a job and realize it doesn't work that way. You get placed in a company and you feel that you need to maintain a specific kind of lifestyle. You start spending a lot money on gadgets, trips and eating out. You never realize the difference between being rich & looking rich. You get trapped in the phenomena of looking rich and never realize that it will never let you become rich.

;;How Did Michael Saylor Make His Money?;Michael Saylor is a software developer and Bitcoin investor worth $1.8 billion. Although he originally wanted to become a pilot, a health condition forced him to change his goal. He applied his deep understanding of mathematics to create business intelligence products with predictive features. More recently, he has become a noteworthy Bitcoin investor who probably ranks among the cryptocurrency‚Äôs top 10 owners. Michael Saylor studied aeronautics and technology at MIT with hopes of becoming a pilot. A medical condition prevented him from reaching that dream, so he accepted a job offer from The National Group. At the consulting firm, he focused on building computer simulations that predicted outcomes. A year after joining The National Group, he became an internal consultant with DuPont. While at DuPont, he developed predictive models that anticipated downturns in some areas of the chemical company‚Äôs sectors. This initial success helped save DuPont countless dollars and established Saylor as an effective consultant.  Saylor worked with DuPont for four years before he had enough money to start his own business independent of The National Group. He reached out to Sanju Bansal, a fraternity brother whose work he had admired at MIT. Together, they co-founded MicroStrategy and started building business intelligence software. People often say that Michael Saylor worked at McDonald‚Äôs, but this is only partially true. Really, he worked with his team at MicroStrategy to build software solutions for the fast food giant. McDonald‚Äôs became MicroStrategy‚Äôs first major client in 1992 when it awarded a $10 million contract to the startup. MicroStrategy‚Äôs success with data mining and analytics earned it a positive reputation that led to several years of rapid growth. Saylor had an impressive career years before he started investing in Bitcoin seriously. His work creating innovative business intelligence solutions earned him awards from MIT Technology Review and other prestigious organizations. Saylor spent three decades as MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO. During that time, he took the company public and attracted major investors that helped build out its business intelligence solutions. Each release anticipated the growing digital needs of businesses. Saylor also had to contend with some emergencies during his term as CEO. The SEC reviewed MicroStrategy‚Äôs accounting processes and found discrepancies that led to a million-dollar fine. MicroStrategy never admitted to any wrongdoing, but it agreed to have a third party handle its accounting needs. Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy with two friends in 1989. Saylor served as the company‚Äôs CEO until 2022, when Phong Lee took the position. Saylor said that leaving the role would give him more time to concentrate on studying Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. During Saylor‚Äôs tenure as CEO, MicroStrategy released at least 13 business intelligence software solutions. MicroStrategy 2020 includes a revamped version of the software‚Äôs Hyperintelligence analytics tool. Saylor oversaw several important tasks as MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO. He acquired and sold several smaller businesses. He established fruitful connections with venture capitalists. He also took the company public. As his interest in Bitcoin grew, though, he wanted to give someone else oversight of the company‚Äôs operations. Michael Saylor made his money as co-founder and CEO of Microstrategy, and subsequently as a bitcoin investor. MicroStrategy invested $250 million in Bitcoin. Saylor has continued to buy more Bitcoin since. In November 2023, the company acquired 16,130 coins. It‚Äôs portfolio now includes 174,530 Bitcoin. Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility made investors worry that MicroStrategy would need to sell some of its coins as the value fell to $20,000. The company had enough cash reserves that it could hold its investment, though. The strategy paid off as Bitcoin has since reached $44,000. Bitcoin investing needs a strategy that accounts for the assets‚Äô volatility. During the 2022 crash, Bitcoin‚Äôs value fell from $69,000 to below $19,000. Why didn‚Äôt Saylor‚Äôs predictive analytics see the crash coming? After all, it‚Äôs a volatile currency with a history of sharp ups and downs. Unfortunately, Saylor probably couldn‚Äôt have predicted the fall because FTX declared bankruptcy after its founder committed fraud. No one could have known the company was hiding information. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, was arrested on securities fraud and wire fraud charges. Bitcoin investors lost confidence and sold their coins. As with any asset, the sudden surge in sales forced Bitcoin‚Äôs value down. Saylor lost about $1.3 billion in the crash. However, he was able to retain ownership of his coins instead of selling them to avoid further losses. Keeping the coins positioned Saylor and MicroStrategy for a comeback as Bitcoin‚Äôs value rebounded. Blockchains use anonymous addresses that make it hard to know who owns Bitcoin. Someone can also use multiple blockchain addresses, which makes research even more challenging. Some research and analysis firms think they have an answer. Many say Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has the most Bitcoin. If true, Nakamoto likely owns 1.1 million BTC spread over 22,000 addresses. Saying Satoshi Nakamoto owns the most Bitcoin raises other questions, though. The biggest problem is that no one knows who Nakamoto is. The name probably represents a group of technology developers that created Bitcoin and blockchain databases in the late 2000s. As Bitcoin‚Äôs creators, the person or persons behind Nakamoto had opportunities to buy coins from the beginning, meaning they could purchase whole coins for pennies. Regardless of who or what Nakamoto is, they‚Äôre universally regarded as the largest Bitcoin investor. Saylor thinks Bitcoin‚Äôs value will skyrocket before the end of 2024. Sure, that‚Äôs a bullish position, but he has reasons to believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs investment potential. Bitcoin caps the number of coins that can exist. This feature means that coins become harder and more expensive to mine over time. Saylor believes that the dwindling supply and high mining costs will force Bitcoin miners to start selling more of their coins. When this happens, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity will encourage investors to buy. Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin prediction depends on serious people taking over the industry. He believes reliable companies like MicroStrategy need to become the industry‚Äôs leaders instead of letting young, idealistic people like Bankman-Fried undermine Bitcoin‚Äôs future. As he put it, ‚Äúthe adults‚Äù need to take over and replace less serious people without business experience. There are good reasons to believe more mature, grounded influencers would benefit Bitcoin‚Äôs future as an investment asset. Bankman-Fried famously contended that FTX didn‚Äôt need a CFO because he knew where the money was, making the CFO position irrelevant. A more rational approach would apply sound business principles to Bitcoin instead of trusting eccentric individuals to lead the way. Is Saylor correct about Bitcoin‚Äôs potential? Only the market can say for sure. Although FTX scared investors, it also brought Bitcoin back into media headlines, which could rejuvenate interest in the crypto asset. If that happens, the market could find a new group of users. As they invest, Bitcoin‚Äôs value should grow and Saylor will become even wealthier. When Financhill publishes its #1 stock, listen up.

Cathy Merrill: Today we‚Äôre going to be talking to you about crypto as I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôm going to give a little facts that you know very well, but 20% of American adults own crypto at this point. The crypto market is valued at about 1.75 trillion, which is roughly the size of Google. The biggest player in that market is Bitcoin, which on its own would be I think the 11th largest currency in the world. You own 125,000 Bitcoins or about $5.5 billion worth, so you are the largest holder in the world. Michael Saylor: As of yesterday, we have 129,000. We announced we bought 4,000 more. Cathy Merrill: Oh, okay. I‚Äôm a little behind. Michael Saylor: You can‚Äôt can‚Äôt stop buying Bitcoin Cathy. Cathy Merrill: Cannot stop buying. Well, that‚Äôs what everyone wants to talk about. As you and I discussed, there‚Äôs a lot of questions. We‚Äôre going to try to do them rapidly so we can get through as many as we can. Let me start with a basic question. Somewhere in January of 2009, someone took some code, they broke it into 21 million bits and called it Bitcoin. They‚Äôll never be more than 21 million of these bits. They‚Äôre now each worth about $44,000. Is it a currency or is it a commodity? How do you think about it? Michael Saylor: I think the best way to think of it is digital property. Also, you could think of it as the world‚Äôs first digital commodity. The idea behind Bitcoin is to create perfect money or another way to think of it is create perfect gold. If I could take the entire supply of gold, like 6 billion ounces or whatever it is, and if I could reduce it to 21 million gold coins and then if I could dematerialize them so that they‚Äôre weightless and magically I could move them at the speed of light and compose and decompose them. If I could split them into 100 million little elements we call Satoshi and then I could store them in cyberspace. And if I could find an incorruptible software program that would keep track of who owns the 21 million virtual coins, then you would have Bitcoin. And so the idea a Bitcoin is we put our money in cyberspace, we put computers in charge, software programs in charge, but then we distribute the software program so it runs on hundreds of thousands of different computers and every computer has a copy of the same program and the same ledger so that nobody can cheat anybody and any of the nodes that get corrupted get thrown off the network. So it‚Äôs a living creature distributed in cyber space. And the purpose is to create a shared immutable ledger of who owns what. And that‚Äôs been a- Cathy Merrill: It‚Äôs like a giant Google drive spreadsheet, but every time someone touches it, you know who touch. Everyone can see who touched it, right? Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs right. And so the whole idea is you can‚Äôt mine anymore gold, it‚Äôs just capped to 21 million and you don‚Äôt have to worry about some central bank or some custodian taking your gold and selling it to someone else and you don‚Äôt know, and nobody can seize it. And the ownership of the Bitcoin is through the possession of private keys. So you can in theory own any amount of it, $10,000, $10 billion. And if you convey the private keys to someone else on the network, then the ownership moves to them away from you. And so for the first time, we‚Äôve got immortal money that can move at the speed of light and can be programmed on a computer. That‚Äôs the big idea. Cathy Merrill: So let‚Äôs talk about the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are now over 10,000 cryptocurrencies, some of which can be flooded the way potentially the gold market could be flooded because we could find a new gold mine vein tomorrow and not know that it exists. Are the other cryptocurrencies fundamentally different than Bitcoin in that way? Are they the same? Michael Saylor: Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs first engineered monetary system. And so the protocol is meant to do one thing really well, keep track of who owns everything forever without breaking in a secure fashion. The other cryptos, some of them pursued something similar, but a lot of them pursue other objectives. They want to be crypto platforms for building smart contracts or issuing NFTs, or they want to run decentralized exchanges. And these are all different missions and they generally end up with a lot more complicated code and different and types of code. If you think about creating life and cyberspace, my idea of life is a virus or a plankton or bacteria, but there‚Äôs someone else that comes up with an idea of life like a flying eagle. Okay. So is an Eagle life? Yeah, but is it like a swarm of hornets and is it like bacteria? No, it‚Äôs a different life. So Bitcoin is engineered to be this base layer of the entire economy, the monetary network. And the thing that‚Äôs unique about it is that it‚Äôs been copied hundreds, thousands of times. And there have been 20,000 different cryptos that have been launched. The issue is which one is best suited to be the fundamental technical, ethical base layer of the cyber economy. And you didn‚Äôt know for 12 years. You only know after you‚Äôve attacked it 25,000 times and copied it 25,000 times, they‚Äôve all failed or they‚Äôre all different. It‚Äôs like, if I release bunny rabbits into Australia and they fill up this niche in the ecosystem, the small furry mammal. Okay, will it work? You don‚Äôt know, but after a hundred years, if bunny rabbits dominate that niche, then they own that niche and they have that part of the food chain. So Bitcoin today is the winner of this global struggle to see what will be the dominant digital monetary asset in the world. And what makes it unique is it‚Äôs the strongest, it has the most energy, it is the strongest network, it is the most capital, it has the most support, it‚Äôs the most robust protocol, it‚Äôs the most unbreakable one, it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs been tested the longest, the most indestructible one, and of course the most well known one. It‚Äôs like the Coca-Cola of digital money and so you‚Äôve got the strongest brand. Cathy Merrill: So someone wrote in and asked if you owned other cryptocurrencies. And so it sounds like, no, but is that true or do you own them? Michael Saylor: No, I don‚Äôt own any others. I think the Bitcoin is unique. I mean, Bitcoin is a property. It‚Äôs like buying a block of Manhattan in cyberspace. Cyber Manhattan, it‚Äôs like Manhattan. And there‚Äôs a million people that want to launch other cities. I have another idea for a city, but it‚Äôs not Manhattan. So the risk of owning anything else is orders of magnitude higher. The return is orders of magnitude lower. I would liken all the other cryptos, they‚Äôre like investing in small startups, right? Like there‚Äôs Apple computer and then my cousin has an idea for a mobile app that‚Äôs to compete with Instagram. So there‚Äôs like 100,000 mobile apps launched and 99.9% of them all fail and then one of them will be WhatsApp or Instagram and Snapchat. So you might get a Snapchat, but you‚Äôll probably get one of the losers. And it‚Äôs not the same as investing in Apple stock, which is like holding the broad based index of all mobile functionality. So Bitcoin is the risk off asset in the space, right? It‚Äôs the most certain thing. Everything else is a risk on asset that has more security risk. You have to analyze it, there‚Äôs more competition, there‚Äôs more complexity, there‚Äôs more regulatory risk. And if you‚Äôre a specialist like a venture capitalist and you want to basically spend your full time analyzing the space, maybe you can invest in that space. But if any ordinary person said, ‚ÄúOkay, well I‚Äôm 60. I want to retire. How do I allocate my assets?‚Äù It‚Äôs like you some land, maybe in the S&P index you own a little bit of stock portfolio. And then if you want to own a digital property, Bitcoin is the risk off digital property, own some of that. And I‚Äôm not going to tell you to go investing in small startups. Cathy Merrill: Yeah. So for someone listening here who‚Äôs got a sizable 401k, maybe they‚Äôve saved, they‚Äôve owned their house, they maybe own some one off stocks that they‚Äôve picked themselves outside their 401k, maybe they own a little bit of gold. Where does in your world, Bitcoin or crypto fall into that? Is it like a little bit of gold or you would convert a lot of your 401k to it or? Michael Saylor: Bitcoin‚Äôs property. Cathy Merrill: About $5 billion. Michael Saylor: Yeah. So let‚Äôs just talk about why would you want to own property. If the money supply is expanding at 7% a year and you own property and it‚Äôs scarce and desirable, your property will probably go up in value 7% a year. And that‚Äôs the history of property for the past 100 years. So when you get to a point where you want to be invested, if you have money you want to save and give to your grandchildren, the least risky thing to do is put it in a scarce desirable property that some affluent intelligent person will want to buy from you in 30 years or 100 years. So Bitcoin fits that bucket and it competes with owning a building or owning a‚Ä¶ If you wanted to have a second rental home, you would buy a second home and you would Airbnb it or you would rent it. And the benefit of that is you‚Äôre invested in property and you can maybe put a mortgage on it so you can leverage it up. And then the detriment is you got to maintain the home and storm might hit it. And then if nobody rents it from you or they trash it. Maybe you can‚Äôt rent it at certain points in time if it‚Äôs in the wrong place. So what if I could snap my fingers and convert your rental Airbnb apartment into a Bitcoin, I call it a digital virtual apartment. And then if I told you it could last forever, you don‚Äôt have to repaint it and then you can teleport it to place in the world where anybody needs it for the Japanese Olympics or you can move it to the Cannes Film Festival and you find the highest bidder. And then when they don‚Äôt want anymore, you bring it back and you teleport it to New York or Paris or London. So think of it as like your digital apartment that you can put a mortgage on and that you can rent out to the highest that you can also carry around in the palm of your hand and hold on an Android or an iPhone. Now, ask yourself the question, how much of your portfolio do you want to invested in that kind of property? And then maybe you want to invest in Facebook or Apple, or you want to invest in a stock because you like that or maybe you want to speculate or gamble your money. So you go gamble some money and then you have some money in a checking account because you got to pay your bills in the next 90 days. And so you divide your money that way. The checking account‚Äôs least risky. The property is a little bit of risk but not nearly as risky as investments in stocks. And then of course the speculations, the meme coins or the meme stocks or the gambling on the horse, that‚Äôs very risky. And of course, one more point to make is the problem with holding a million dollars of cash in a bank is that it has been losing 7% of its value a year for a hundred years, but it‚Äôs losing about 14 to 21% of its value now. So you‚Äôre guaranteed to lose 90% of the money you have in the bank over a decade in an inflationary environment. So that‚Äôs a built in risk, it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb. So that drives you to say, ‚ÄúWell, I got to put it in property or I got to put it in investment or I got to gamble it.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what I would say to an individual. Cathy Merrill: Thank you. For those that don‚Äôt follow that math. You‚Äôre saying the currency, especially with inflation right now is in decline. The dollar is worth less than it was worth 100 ago. Michael Saylor: Yeah. Let‚Äôs talk about the issue of inflation. It‚Äôs very important, incredibly important. The house that I live in right now is 305 times more expensive than it was in 1930, 305. That means that the dollar has lost 99.7% of its value in 90 years. Now if you back calculate that implies that the actual inflation rate of the currency has been about six and a half to 7% a year for 100 years. If you‚Äôre calculating the rate at which things you want to buy go up in price, the real inflation rate for a hundred years is 7%. The government published inflation rate is 2%. The difference is the government‚Äôs tracking a consumer basket of goods and they make hedonic adjustments. So they‚Äôre telling you that you should be happy in an 800 square foot apartment made of drywall watching Netflix and Netflix hasn‚Äôt gone up. But 30 years ago, they would actually calculate the price of a bigger apartment or the price to buy, but they don‚Äôt do that anymore. And they‚Äôre not calculating the cost to buy assets. So if you want to buy something like a house on the beach, well, housing went up in price 20% year over year, 19.2% according to Case‚ÄìShiller index. And yet the government says that the CPI is only up 7.9%. So the inflation rate if you already own a house or if you don‚Äôt want to buy a house and you live in your parents‚Äô basement is 7.9%. But the inflation rate if you‚Äôre a first time home buyer is 19.2%. So if you calculate, if you consider the rate at which the money is losing value, the answer you come to is the United States dollars lost 99.7% of its value. It will lose 99.9% of its value over 100 years and every other currency loses 100% of its value over 100 years. And your only hope to preserve your wealth is to convert that currency into a property. If you convert it into a house, you got a 305 X return on your money, right? So just buy a house. But what‚Äôs the problem with that? The problem with that is that Florida taxes housing and real estate at 2% a year. So if I convert a million dollars of cash into a million dollar house, I have to come up with $20,000 a year and I lose the house in 50 years. And that‚Äôs assuming they don‚Äôt reappraise the house up, but of course they will. So in fact, if you convert a million dollars of cash into a house in Florida, you‚Äôll lose all the money in about 30 years. So that means I got to go and I got to risk the million dollars by betting on a company, or I got to gamble the million dollars. Why? Because there‚Äôs no perfected money that I could just convert the cash into. Well, Bitcoin is the first example of an asset where you simply convert a million in currency into a million dollars of Bitcoin. And then because you can‚Äôt make any more Bitcoin, Bitcoin price appreciates at the rate of inflation and it also appreciates with adoption and it also appreciates with technology advance. So people that are buying Bitcoin are saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to gamble in the market, I don‚Äôt want to gamble on meme coins. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being taxed to death on my real estate. The government is already confiscating and seizing all my property via tax and via a sanction. So what I want is property in cyberspace I can hold in my head, carry around in my hand that no one‚Äôs going to take away from me and they‚Äôre going to not going to de base. And then I‚Äôll just hold that for my life.‚Äù Cathy Merrill: What do you say to the people that are scared about the regulation that‚Äôs coming in and they don‚Äôt understand the tax implications? Most of the banks won‚Äôt touch it. Merrill Lynch is like, ‚ÄúWell, we are not you‚Äôre a client. We don‚Äôt deal with that.‚Äù Michael Saylor: Yeah. So the regulation that‚Äôs coming is- Cathy Merrill: That‚Äôs true of Morgan Stanley, Goldman, everywhere. I mean, you know that. Michael Saylor: The regulation that‚Äôs coming is going to be really good for Bitcoin and it‚Äôs good for digital property adoption because it‚Äôs going to create bright lines that cause an avalanche of institutional money to come into this space and buy the asset. So the regulation is good. The tax treatment is set by the IRS in 2014, it‚Äôs just property and if you sell it at a capital gain, you owe capital gains, either long term or short term capital gains. So that‚Äôs not really misunderstood. What you want to do is you want to buy it and hold it for as long as you can. And if you need money, you borrow against the asset and that way you don‚Äôt pay the capital gains tax ever. But if you do sell it or transfer it, you owe capital gains tax. With regard to the big bulge bracket banks, 24 months ago Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi Group, they wouldn‚Äôt touch it, but they wouldn‚Äôt even talk about it. In the last 24 months. Every one of those banks has started covering it. They have analysts publishing every week and they have embraced it. The head of JP Morgan four years ago said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it. You‚Äôll get fired if you use it.‚Äù But this year said, ‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt quite understand it, but my customers want it, so we‚Äôll sell it to them.‚Äù The head of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon said the same thing. The previous head- Cathy Merrill: Janet Yellen said last week that she thought it was the future. I mean, she didn‚Äôt say it was the future, she said‚Ä¶ Michael Saylor: She kind of said it is the future. But maybe a more important opinion was Joe Biden‚Äôs opinion because the White House issued an executive order a few weeks ago. And in that executive order it said, ‚ÄúWhereas 40 million Americans have crypto assets and they think it‚Äôs the future, I hear by direct all the government agencies to figure out how to responsibly regulate it and incorporate it into our government.‚Äù So in essence what you‚Äôve got is when Biden was elected, Biden brought a bunch of progressive regulators, Janet Yellen and Gary Gensler, and they kept Jerome Powell. All three of them are on record as saying, ‚ÄúThis is a digital asset. It may be speculative, but it‚Äôs not going away. And we understand why people would want it. It doesn‚Äôt compete with the dollar. We‚Äôre not going to ban it. We are going to embrace it. You have to pay your taxes on it. If you transfer a billion dollars secretly, you‚Äôre going to have to disclose it.‚Äù They‚Äôll apply all the standard anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing, tax code to it because that‚Äôs what an adult would do with regard to a new technology. But there‚Äôs no political interest in banning Bitcoin or holding it back at the administration level. And there‚Äôs profound enthusiastic support for it in the Senate and in Congress. And I actually think that the regulators and the administration are also very enthusiastically embracing it. Because Cathy, in the last 100 years, when did the White House ever issue an executive order legitimizing a new asset class telling everybody to figure it out? Cathy Merrill: Yeah, that‚Äôs a big deal. Michael Saylor: Right? I mean, that‚Äôs really a first. It‚Äôs certainly a first this century. The last time we invented a new asset class, 30, 40, 50 years ago, maybe a commodity index. The equivalent would really be like the Vanguard 500 or the S&P index like John Bogle saying you should just buy an index of stocks. It‚Äôs more profound than that in some ways, but it‚Äôs a similar idea that you just got to get comfortable with. Cathy Merrill: Well, I think they also know that almost all ransomware payments now are done in Bitcoin. That‚Äôs what they want because it can travel without people seeing it. Michael Saylor: Actually the truth is there‚Äôs 17,000 cryptos, but some of them are specifically for moving money without anybody knowing and those get a lot more heat from law enforcement. Bitcoin is a public ledger. So if I send you $100, everybody in the world knows that it went from my wallet to yours. I mean, it‚Äôs completely transparent. Not only can you look at every transaction in Bitcoin every 10 minutes, you can download the entire software to a $400 device and you would‚Äôve a record of every Bitcoin transaction since the beginning of time, right? It‚Äôs completely transparent. And in the big crypto bust that took place a few weeks ago, I think the law enforcement, the FBI traced $3 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been heisted often in exchange because it is transparent. So you might get some Bitcoin transferred to you, but you can‚Äôt ever spend it because you won‚Äôt be able to liquidate it on the exchanges because they know that it‚Äôs a criminal that has the wallet. And so it‚Äôs not really good for that. You would rather use gold or cash in that situation. Cathy Merrill: When you look at that blockchain of transactions, do you see it growing in the US or abroad and have you seen it moving around Ukraine and that part of the world, because people are trying‚Ä¶ I know my Ukrainian friend, her family can‚Äôt get money out of the ATM there. So do you look at that code in those transactions? Michael Saylor: Well, I mean, you don‚Äôt actually know where the‚Ä¶ For example, if I had a billion dollars and I knew the private key is in my head, I could go anywhere in the world, right? The billion is sitting at an address. You don‚Äôt know where I am and I could send it anywhere in the world. I could actually move it anywhere in the world every second. So the point is the money‚Äôs not some place, the money is in cyberspace, right? It‚Äôs sitting in the ether. So I wouldn‚Äôt think of it like that, but maybe the more interesting question is why is adoption of Bitcoin exploding right now around the world? And the answer is because it solves a problem that people are facing. And if you look at the key things that have happened, the bank system has seized up in the developing world, like in Lebanon and in Turkey and in Afghanistan and Iraq, lots of parts of Africa, lots of parts of South America. Cypress was an example. When the bank freezes, it basically freezes all your assets and then it converts them from whatever the dollars are to local currency and it devalues them. So the first driver is people don‚Äôt trust the banks and they don‚Äôt trust their local currencies. They‚Äôre all collapsing. The second driver is the Canadian trucker crisis traumatized hundreds of millions of people because the message there was, if you‚Äôre an American citizen and if the head of another country Canada disagrees with your politics, he could just seize your money, take it without a court order without due process. So you‚Äôre an American and a Canadian politician just took millions of dollars overnight from you just because he wanted to. So that caused a bunch of P people to think, I can‚Äôt really trust a politician. And if I have the wrong politics, they‚Äôll just take my money, right? Cathy Merrill: Right. People don‚Äôt trust politicians? When did that happen? Michael Saylor: Yeah, it‚Äôs a while. So the third thing was the Ukrainian war. And then all the banks in Ukraine froze and people want to get out of the country or they want to move and they can‚Äôt get any money, right? And then all the Russian banks froze and the Russian market froze. So you‚Äôve got 300 million people with a bank crisis, a currency crisis. When that happened, the Russian currency crashed by 30% and then the Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian and Turkish currencies all weakened. So everyone in that part of the world lost anywhere from three to 30% of all their wealth and maybe they lost three to 30% for of what they‚Äôre going to have. So that‚Äôs a big panic. Then what happened was the Russian sanctions where the West basically seized 300 billion of gold and currency derivatives from Russia and then they started seizing all the property of all the Russian oligarchs. And the mainstream media view is, yeah, we should do that, right? They‚Äôre spoilers of war. But the United States never declared war in Russia. So this is an example of one country not at war with another country where citizens of the one country are having all their property seized by other countries without due process immediately. And so that means that everyone that has any assets anywhere in the world that thinks they might ever be an opposition to any politician anywhere else in the world is feeling very insecure about their property rights. So who might be concerned? Well, you start with the Chinese, they have $3 trillion worth of currency derivatives. So if they invade Taiwan and they lose 3 trillion, or maybe if they just get in a diplomatic dispute over the South China Sea. So then you have the Emiratis and you have all the Middle Easterners and you have all the Africans, you have all the Asians and the Kazakhs and you have all the south Americans, everybody feels insecure about their assets. And so if you feel insecure, who can you trust? And if you can‚Äôt trust your local currency, and if you can‚Äôt trust your local bank and if you‚Äôre building and sports team and boats and company stock is going to be seized because it‚Äôs international and everybody has international somewhere, right? If that‚Äôs the case, then you think what do I do? And the answer is, first of all, I get my money out of the bank. And so I would take my dollars out of the bank and I‚Äôd buy crypto dollars like Tether or some stable coin. And then I want custodianship of it. I want custody, I want to hold it on my own phone, because if you had your money, if you had $10 million in Lebanon before the crisis in the bank, you lost it all. And if you had the $10 million on a crypto device, you‚Äôre still rich, you still have it all. And so people are opting out of the conventional system. And then of course, well, what good is it to own a building in downtown Kiev or Moscow, right? I mean, you can‚Äôt rent the building to anybody, right? Cathy Merrill: And most of the world has phones now, but they don‚Äôt really have access to play in the market. So this is something that somebody in Africa could buy on their phone, right? Michael Saylor: And it gets us to this issue of human rights. If I give $10,000 to someone in Africa and they have to convert it into the local currency, then the $10,000 is going to be worth $500 in a matter of a few years. So I can‚Äôt even give you the money if the currency doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs collapsing. So if you put it in a bank, the bank steals it. But the bank won‚Äôt give you a bank account. I mean, there‚Äôs 3 billion people that can‚Äôt get a bank account even if they had the money. But if they did get the bank account, someone in Africa can‚Äôt very well be buying a diversified portfolio, a big tech stocks that trade on the NASDAQ. You can‚Äôt physically buy it. So if you have some money, tell me, what do you want to own in Africa that you think is higher quality than owning your house in Maryland or Virginia? What do you want to own? Nothing, right? So there‚Äôs nothing you can buy, right? Okay, buy a bar of gold, carry that around and someone with a machine gun shoots you and takes the gold, unless you go through an airport and they just take it. So how do I actually preserve my economic wealth if I‚Äôm one of the three or 4 billion people in these countries where you can‚Äôt trust the currency, you can‚Äôt trust the government, you can‚Äôt trust your neighbor, you can‚Äôt the bank? And the answer is I download an application to an Android phone, and I put some digital dollars like stable coin and I put some Bitcoin, some digital property on it and I don‚Äôt tell anybody to have it. And if I need to flee the country, I could take it with me. If they‚Äôre going to seize my phone, I could just memorize it and I walk out of the country remembering 12 words, and I keep my wealth. And if I live in America and my loved one is in Nigeria and I want to send them money the conventional way, it takes weeks, there‚Äôs a 10% fee, when they go to get it from the bank, someone robs them. On the other hand, I can just put money in a lightning wallet on a Sunday afternoon and in 30 seconds, zap it to them, friction free for nothing. And I cut out the banks and I cut out the robbers and I cut out the crappy currency and the money changers, right? There‚Äôs a reason that Jesus Christ, what is it, when he goes into the temple and he runs out the money changers, right? He‚Äôs like, you guys are ripping off the people. If you live anywhere in the developing world, you‚Äôre probably losing 10% of your money on transfer just in remittance payments. That‚Äôs each time it moves. And then you lose 20, 30% of it a year to inflation, unless you‚Äôre losing 60% a year to inflation. So it‚Äôs a human rights issue. And people that like Bitcoin think this is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people whose life is hopeless without this technology. Cathy Merrill: So I‚Äôm going to go flip to two quick questions, because one question that just came through was about, because you‚Äôre an evangelist for this is what do you recommend the easiest way to purchase Bitcoin is? The wallet is how people buy currency. Do you have a wallet you prefer? And how do you recommend someone who doesn‚Äôt own any buy it? Michael Saylor: Okay. Well the answer to the first question is you would go to a regulated, licensed exchange in the jurisdiction where you preside. So if you‚Äôre in the US, there are well considered exchanges. Fidelity has a digital assets group. Coinbase is probably the best known, for corporations Knighted, and there are other exchanges. You should do your research and decide which one you trust and which service you trust. If you are interested in resources, if you go to hope.com, H-O-P-E, just remember Bitcoin is hope, then we‚Äôve got tons of education. I would say, you should get yourself educated and become a sophisticated consumer and then do your research and find an institution you trust. What‚Äôs the next question? Cathy Merrill: Okay. On mining, because there‚Äôs a lot about this about energy. And China, as you know, banned crypto mining, so now about 35% is done in the United States. And for those people new to this, the mining is when those transactions get added to the block, it‚Äôs a lot of computers that are following it, and those computers take up a lot of energy. Does that bother you? Michael Saylor: No, actually that‚Äôs what makes it immortal and incorruptible. The Bitcoin mining process is the process of taking raw electricity and then encrypting it with the SHA-256 algorithm. So it‚Äôs encrypted energy. You‚Äôre digitally transforming the energy using a semiconductor chip, which we call Bitcoin miner. And traditionally the biggest manufacturer of that hardware were Chinese companies like Bitmain. But Intel just announced last week that they‚Äôre going to be producing Bitcoin miners and a new Bitcoin mining chip. So the way the network works is I buy the Bitcoin miners, I put it in a data center, I feed it electricity. It throws up a wall of encrypted energy to protect your assets from a hostile attack by a hacker or a nation state or a mal factor. If you didn‚Äôt do that, then someone could just come up with acute piece of code, hack the system and steal all of the hundreds of billions of dollars. And if they did that once, that‚Äôs the end of the world. Cathy Merrill: Do you ever think mining will be carbon neutral? Michael Saylor: The most important thing about mining is it‚Äôs the cleanest, most efficient energy use in the world. I mean, this is the cleanest industry in the world. Many people don‚Äôt realize that. That‚Äôs because most of the ESG FUD is spread by other crypto network entrepreneurs that are using it as gorilla marketing. So they would want you to think that there‚Äôs an issue. But if you thought about it for a while, you would realize that‚Ä¶ Let me just give you the fact. Bitcoin mining uses 14 basis points of the world‚Äôs energy. So like one 10th of 1% of all of the energy in the world is Bitcoin mining. It‚Äôs really de minimus. Second, it‚Äôs going to decrease. It‚Äôs headed toward one 100th of 1% because the semiconductor technology has improved by orders of magnitude. So it‚Äôs just like Moore‚Äôs law. We keep making the chips faster. So as companies like Intel, they just released a chip that‚Äôs 21 joules/terahash. And it used to be we used 1,250 joules/terahash. So it used to be a hundred times more energy intensive to mine. So the industry itself is a technology business getting exponentially more efficient. But if you look at the electricity, the electricity used is 58% sustainable already, which means that is cleaner than electricity in your Tesla or is cleaner than all the energy used in planes, trains, automobiles, buildings, food, hospitals, national defense, banking. Every other thing in the world uses dirtier energy and more energy. So if you‚Äôre really an environmentalist and I told you that 99.95% of carbon emissions come from stuff that‚Äôs not Bitcoin and Bitcoin energy efficiency is improving 36% a year. So it‚Äôs neither the problem, nor is it the solution to any environmental concern. What it is is an industry that uses encrypted energy in order to create an open permissionless crypto asset so that it is ethically technically sound. If I eliminated the energy, then I would have a security. And it‚Äôs like in Fortnite, I would‚Äôve a video game in Fortnite or Roblox, I can move coupons around without using encrypted energy like Bitcoin uses, but you‚Äôre trusting the board of directors of Fortnite or the board of directors of Roblox to not corrupt the currency and steal all your money. And since it‚Äôs a company, no country‚Äôs ever going to trust an American company to issue the currency that they run their world on, right? Plus because it‚Äôs a security, it‚Äôs unethical for a public figure to endorse a security. So if you want to create a non-security, if you want to create a property, it has to be open to permissionless. The only way that we‚Äôve ever figured out how to do that in the history of the world is proof of work mining, which is what the Bitcoin mining network is. So it‚Äôs not causing a carbon problem, it‚Äôs not even a big energy user, it‚Äôs simply is a extremely efficient use of energy because you put about $2 billion worth of electricity into a network to create an $800 billion of value. And if you compare that energy efficiency to $2 billion put into the airplane business, you realize that it‚Äôs 1,000 times more expensive to fly an airplane around and get value from that as it is to keep track of or keep a digital asset secure. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Let me ask you about some of the things around on the outside of crypto, or I guess part of the new waves of crypto. You have 40 patents. Are you buying NFTs? Michael Saylor: No. Look, Bitcoin is scarce, desirable. It‚Äôs basically a block in cyber Manhattan and there‚Äôs only going to be one and there‚Äôs no reason to think it won‚Äôt be valuable 1,000 years from now. And when you buy it, you‚Äôre buying one 21,000,000th of all the economic energy in the network, maybe all the economic energy that‚Äôs ever going to be in the world, right? It‚Äôs a very profound, deep, dominant network. NFTs represent crypto art. And they compete with physical art and sculpture and every other form of art and it‚Äôs still a fairly early embryonic business, but they‚Äôre not particularly. You can create a million, a billion, a hundred billion different NFTs. I can write an algorithm to create them. So primarily their art that has value because of the marketing of the art and other technicalities that have to do with the leverage that‚Äôs used by those crypto networks to monetize them. But I don‚Äôt see the‚Ä¶ If I was going to buy art, I would buy all the Picassos, right? And even then, say you bought all the Picasso or all Leonardo DaVinci or something like that, your bet is that the human race in 1,000 years will still value 19th century impressionist paintings, right? And if that‚Äôs your bet, there‚Äôs a risk. But I think it‚Äôs more likely the human race will value pure energy or pure money 1,000 years from now than it will value 19th century impressionist. They will have a place, but there‚Äôs 1,000 years worth of other art to be created that‚Äôs going to dilute that art and the culture. And so you‚Äôre taking a risk, you‚Äôre expressing a sentiment. Cathy Merrill: Let me ask you another question. This came from the audience. In the simplest way, because I think it could get detailed, but what applications do you see for blockchain that are outside of crypto? Blockchain‚Äôs pretty exciting. How do you see it transforming other industries or other parts of society? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt really think there‚Äôs any other low risk, compelling, obvious application of blockchain right now. I think it‚Äôs heavily marketed and hyped by people in the industry. The real compelling application of blockchain is a decentralized global crypto property that can replace gold as a non sovereign bear instrument store of value. And that‚Äôs what Bitcoin is. As that spreads, that could be worth hundreds of trillions of dollars. So that is a big idea. All the other ideas are questionable because any application you want to build, you could build with a website or a mobile phone as a company, and then you could just run it against Bitcoin. So if you really want to move money at the speed of light and sell it and give flash loans and mortgage it, you can simply build a website like Coinbase, plug Bitcoin into it and then give it to the world. The reason they don‚Äôt do that Cathy, is because it‚Äôs illegal. The reason that you don‚Äôt get a flash loan from Apple computer or Google is because it‚Äôs illegal. Because you have to get regulatory approval from the SCC. So companies don‚Äôt do these things because they‚Äôre not compliant with existing regulation. If the regulations allowed you to give flash loans and do DeFi, then Citadel or JP Morgan or a Coinbase or Apple, they could spin up a website and they could trade with 8 billion people in Singapore and China and everywhere else and they could do it with simple non decentralized code. The things that people are deal doubling with in the crypto world, they‚Äôre pursuing smart contracts and art and NFT and I grant you it‚Äôs exciting, but it‚Äôs all in the regulatory gray zone. Because for example, DeFi. DeFi is running a stock exchange without KYC. So why is it that people in the US, why is it that a company doesn‚Äôt run a stock exchange on a website without KYC? And the answer is because it‚Äôs illegal, right? It‚Äôs non-compliant and you get shut down by the regulators. So I would say, when you look at the safe harbors, it‚Äôs legal to own property in the US. It may not be legal to own property in North Korea or Cuba, right? So if you‚Äôre in a communist regime, Bitcoin might be banned. But if you‚Äôre in the Western Europe or the US and you want to own a Bitcoin in lieu of a house, you‚Äôre in a very safe zone and that‚Äôs a business which is something worth promoting. But on the other hand, if your idea is you want to run a bank, but you don‚Äôt want to comply with regulations and if you want to do lots of other things, you want to run insurance companies, but not comply with regulations, then yeah you need a decentralized thing, but is it really decentralized? And most of them aren‚Äôt really decentralized. And so that means that the regulators start to clamp down, they launch enforcement actions. So that‚Äôs why I would say, no, they‚Äôre not all equal. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs 10 ideas and they‚Äôre all equally good, you should diversify. There‚Äôs one good idea that‚Äôs worth hundreds of trillions of dollars that‚Äôll solve half the problems of the human race. And then there‚Äôs a hundred other ideas that have 1,000 X as much risk, 1,000 X as competition. And all the other things, they only exist at the pleasure of the regulators right now, right? There‚Äôs probably out of 17,000 cryptos Cathy, there might be six you could debate or property, that means a commodity. There‚Äôs one that we all agree on as a commodity that‚Äôs Bitcoin, there‚Äôs six you could debate. The rest are all securities. And if they‚Äôre all securities, they‚Äôre all unregistered securities. And if they‚Äôre all unregistered securities, that means that you really have to be a venture capitalist and you have to parse the competition, the security risk, the regulatory risk, every other liability. And you‚Äôre just wading into a very murky area of speculation. So just keep that in mind when you‚Äôre considering what do you want to promote and what do you, what do you want to dabble with. Cathy Merrill: You‚Äôre promoting Bitcoin. And so my question for you is Bitcoin famously created January, 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto who no one knows who that is. So one of my questions is, is that you because it seems like you are Mr. Bitcoin? And two, has this person ever reached out to you as the biggest owner of this thing they created? Have they ever back channeled you in some way? Michael Saylor: Okay. So you‚Äôre too kind. It‚Äôs not me. And Satoshi‚Äôs gone and never coming back and has disappeared. And it really allows me to make a point about the providence of the network. The reason that people are passionate about Bitcoin is because of the immaculate conception of Bitcoin, it‚Äôs ethically sound and it‚Äôs fair. What you had was one pseudonymous programmer that finally launched a successful crypto network that had no value for 15 months. And that‚Äôs like starting a fire, after 50 tries they‚Äôd failed and the 51st time they launched it and it caught a little bit of energy and it started to burn. Satoshi operated and there are about a million coins that are called Satoshi coins that were mined in the early years or the early year. Those have never moved. Satoshi disappeared after about 18 months, never to be heard from again and said, ‚ÄúOkay, I pass the Baton,‚Äù knowing that if this had a founder or if this had a controlling entity or if there was a company or a group of people behind it, then it would start to look more like a security and there would be a question of, is it fair? Is it fair that some early person got their coins for free? And so Bitcoin never had a pre mine, right? The Satoshi coins never moved. It never had an ICO. There was never an IPO. No insiders ever invested in it. And it‚Äôs very important to decentralize. So there was never a big company backer, a Facebook, an Apple, a Google, a Microsoft that we might not trust. There was never a nation state behind it. It was completely people. And about 15 months into it, we got to a point called pizza day. And on pizza day, Bitcoin was used to pay for two pizzas, 10,000 Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin for the first time had a value of like 2 cents. So the thing it burned with no value, nobody thought it would ever be economic. Cathy Merrill: Analogy because now those two coins that that person bought for two slices of pizza would be worth $400 million, right? Michael Saylor: Yeah. $500 million or $450 million today. But the point was the people that got involved, they were hobbyist and idealist. And what they were trying to do was create this ideal organic life form in cyberspace that was fair and equitable. We say, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could settle our differences in a fair and equitable fashion? So that‚Äôs why say there was such pushback when Facebook was going to launch Libra. It‚Äôs like, do we want a powerful company to create their own currency and then push it down their network? It doesn‚Äôt seem fair, right? But with the Satoshi, Satoshi gave a gift to the world, a fair gift. And the fact that Satoshi disappeared and the coins never moved and the stuff never had value, it means that everybody that ever joined the movement joined it on equivalent equitable basis, right? No one had an advantage. Everybody had to take either exponentially more risk or they had to pay exponentially more money and there was nobody that controlled it. And what that meant was no one could corrupt it. And what‚Äôs really critical about Bitcoin is the fact that that monetary policy, 21 million coins, and that expectation, that block size, one megabyte block size that‚Äôs the same today as it was on pizza day when it was worth a penny. And it‚Äôs very important because if you‚Äôre going to ask me, am I willing to risk a billion dollars for 100 years? Well, if you‚Äôre going to bet a billion dollars for the next 100 years, you don‚Äôt want a piece of software that somebody just shipped last month or that they‚Äôre going to fix next year or that they‚Äôre changing or tinkering with, right? You really want to know that this thing is not going to change, it‚Äôs past the test of time, it‚Äôs got a community that‚Äôs idealistic and they‚Äôre going to fight to protect it from corruption. And there can‚Äôt be any one personality because if there‚Äôs one person that becomes a liability as opposed to a feature. Cathy Merrill: You are one person and you are betting billions. So let me ask you some personal questions, okay? Michael Saylor: Sure. Cathy Merrill: One, do you tweet yourself or do you have a team that tweets? Michael Saylor: Oh, I tweet myself. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs all me Cathy, all me. All the warts and all. This morning I tweeted Bitcoin is my daily tweet. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Do you have a goal in mind for how much Bitcoin you want to accumulate? Is there a number in your head? Michael Saylor: Another way I look at it is when we generate cash flows where we come across cash, if I hold it‚Äôs going to lose 10 to 20% of its value a year so I convert it into a stronger asset, which is Bitcoin. So we will just keep sweeping our cash flows into Bitcoin forever. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Tomorrow is Matt‚Äôs opening day. If you had a walkout song, what would it be? Michael Saylor: Eminem, Lose Yourself. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Do you have a favorite TV show right now that you‚Äôre watching? Michael Saylor: No, I don‚Äôt have a favorite one. Cathy Merrill: Tell me one book that had a huge impact on you. Michael Saylor: The Bitcoin Standard, caused me to buy billions of dollars of Bitcoin. Cathy Merrill: Okay. I know you‚Äôre a pilot. I know Elon Musk has a spaceship. I know you know him. Are we going to see you in space? Michael Saylor: Maybe one day. We‚Äôll see. Cathy Merrill: Okay. What was the last thing you bought with cryptocurrency? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt think you should buy things with cryptocurrency. I think you should buy cryptocurrency with things. So the best idea is if you had cryptocurrency, in this case Bitcoin, if you have Bitcoin and you want to buy something, you‚Äôre better off to take a loan against it and create an account of dollars or pesos and then you should sell the currency for the thing or trade the currency for the thing you want to buy. And you ought to accumulate the property and hold it forever. Cathy Merrill: What is home screen wallpaper on your phone? And is it orange? Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not orange, it‚Äôs blue and it‚Äôs a picture of Dubrovnik in Croatia, the Mediterranean Sea. Cathy Merrill: It was a beautiful city. Okay. Best concert you ever went to. Most people don‚Äôt know this, you‚Äôre very, very musical. You play yourself. You‚Äôre a musically inclined person. Best concert you ever saw? Michael Saylor: I think I really enjoy seeing Staying at Wolf Trap play up close and personal. Cathy Merrill: And finally, if the government asked you to serve, if they said, ‚ÄúLook, we need someone to regulate all this crypto and someone who knows it in depth,‚Äù would that be something that we could see from you? Michael Saylor: Above my pay grade. I‚Äôm just a humble private citizen. I think I‚Äôll let career regulators and career politicians handle the regulation and the politics. I think I‚Äôm just going to educate and advocate. Cathy Merrill: But hopefully you‚Äôll lend them your brain. Thank you for sharing it with us. There are so many more questions that I didn‚Äôt get to and that people sent in, but it is a huge subject for an hour and thank you for giving it to us. I know you‚Äôre off to speak at the Bitcoin conference, which is attracting a ton of people, so good luck on your speech on that and thank you. Michael Saylor: Thanks, Cathy. I mean, I would say to the audience, if anybody wants more information, remember hope.com. There‚Äôs a whole index of websites, free courses, books, resources, videos there, and pointers to other leaders in the space. Feel free to follow me on Twitter. I post interpretations of regulatory developments, market developments, technical developments in the entire crypto economy every day if you‚Äôre interested. There‚Äôs the Saylor academy saylor.org, has a free Bitcoin for everybody course. It‚Äôs 12 hours. It‚Äôs free. Anybody can take it. And I think the best way to communicate this this is think it‚Äôs like 1900 and someone invented electricity and they came into your town and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this new thing called electricity and we think it‚Äôs going to be in hospitals and cars and planes and trains and boats and government and schools, and we‚Äôre going to teach classes on it.‚Äù And you‚Äôre trying to figure out what does it mean to you, and the answer is, yeah, maybe it‚Äôs scary and maybe it‚Äôs exciting, but it deserves your attention. So treat it with respect and spend some time to educate yourself on it because it‚Äôs all those things. And I think the society had 30, 40 years to figure out electricity. I think it‚Äôll be a decade with people figuring out what Bitcoin is because Bitcoin in its purest form is digital energy and electricity is electrical energy. So if you have digital energy and you didn‚Äôt expect to ever see it in your lifetime, it‚Äôs a paradigm shift. And it means different things to different people. And it‚Äôs extraordinarily exciting. It‚Äôs also scary, it‚Äôs also complicated, right? And I would say everybody can benefit from it, but it‚Äôs such a novel thing that you probably have to spend some time to wrap your head around it in order to get the fullest value from it. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Hope.com, Saylor academy, that‚Äôs the place to tune in. Thank you. Michael Saylor: Thank you. All the best everybody.

;;Bitcoin whale Michael Saylor urges governments to step in and regulate crypto‚Äôs ‚Äòparade of horribles‚Äô;  $USD 51,256.98 0.59% XRP XRP $USD 0.54 -1.04% Dogecoin DOGE $USD 0.08 -0.25% Ethereum ETH $USD 2,917.46 0.66% Cardano ADA $USD 0.59 -2.45%                                                             Powered by The world‚Äôs largest public holder of Bitcoin called on regulators to finally tackle a laundry list of risky, immature crypto industry practices, or ‚Äúparade of horribles,‚Äù that are unfairly weighing on the price of its asset. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor argues the more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies and digital tokens in circulation must be viewed as ‚Äúunregistered securities‚Äù that cannot be likened to a hard commodity like Bitcoin‚Äîwhich has no issuer, no management, no employees, no product cycle, and only a finite supply. Speaking in a webcast with NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich, Saylor said Bitcoin was being caught in the crossfire of a collapsing crypto market since it often served as collateral on margin loans for less proven tokens.  ‚ÄúWhat you have is a $400 billion cloud of opaque, unregistered securities trading without full and fair disclosure, and they are all cross-collateralized with Bitcoin,‚Äù he argued  He added mainstream financial institutions often won‚Äôt touch an asset like Bitcoin ‚Äúbecause of the slime that gets onto the asset class from all the unregistered securities.‚Äù  Nouriel Roubini, a respected economist and one of the few to predict the 2008 global financial crisis, branded crypto on Saturday a Ponzi scheme collapsing upon its own weight.  It‚Äôs attitudes like these that make Saylor, otherwise critical of government intervention in the free market during the pandemic, believe regulators should and will eventually step in to protect investors from the bad apples.  ‚ÄúIf I make a list of the parade of horribles,‚Äù Saylor said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all going to reasonably reverse in the next 10 years.‚Äù He claimed even rock-solid multinationals like Apple would see more volatility in their share price if there were no regulations that, for example, prevent wash trading, a practice of artificially inflating prices by trading between two wallets both owned by the same party. He cited crypto hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, as hindrances rather than facilitators to cryptocurrency adoption.  ‚ÄúThe general public shouldn‚Äôt be buying unregistered securities from wildcat bankers that may or may not be there next Thursday,‚Äù Saylor said, whose company owns 129,218 Bitcoin as of the end of March. 3AC is at risk of complete collapse, in part due to a busted bet on the value of Luna, the governance token that backed the TerraUSD stablecoin that failed.  Last week crypto lender Celsius froze all withdrawals and transfers amid a liquidity crunch, and speculation continues as to whether the ongoing bloodbath in the market will claim only this trio as victims or whether more will eventually emerge.  Bitcoin looks like Chamath took it public via a SPAC ‚ÄúThe crypto exchanges, offshore and onshore, are unregistered, unregulated and offer 20x leverage, they don‚Äôt have mature Chinese walls,‚Äù Saylor said, referring to a common practice of keeping various financial services separate to prevent inherent conflicts of interest. Saylor himself is hurting as his company borrowed $205 million in March to buy more Bitcoin, pledging part of its existing holdings as security, and fears emerged last month that Silvergate Bank would demand further proof that his company was creditworthy.  Henrich did not ask him about the status of the loan or whether Microstrategy received a margin call from Silvergate. Back in August 2020, Saylor turned his business software company into a bet on the future price of Bitcoin, and is now facing impairment charges of over a billion dollars under U.S. accounting rules after the price tumbled below $18,000 this past week. Over the weekend, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele seemed to back away from a month-old pronouncement implicitly urging investors to buy the dip.  This weekend, the first man to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country simply urged enthusiasts to ‚Äúenjoy life‚Äù instead of watching the value of their investment tumble.

;;Bitcoin ETFs Register The Biggest Single-Day Trading Volume, Whales Accumulate;      TRENDING TODAY Bitcoin ETFs continue to be the driving force behind all the trading activity that‚Äôs taking place in and around BTC. On Tuesday, February 20, Bloomberg Intelligence‚Äôs senior ETF strategist Eric Balchunas stated that the nine Bitcoin ETFs have registered the biggest single-day trading volume ever since the launch. In his post on the X platform, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas said that the combined trading volume reached approximately $2 billion, fueled by notable contributions from $HODL, $BTCW, and $BITB, all of which shattered their previous volume records. Balchunas underscores the magnitude of this achievement by providing context: the $2 billion trading volume places The Nine ETFs in the realm of the top 10 among ETFs and the top 20 among individual stocks in terms of trading activity. VanEck‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF has seen an impressive surge, with its trading volume surpassing $300 million, a significant leap compared to its previous best trading day. Data from Yahoo Finance indicates that the ETF achieved its highest daily trading volume of $25.5 million on its launch day, January 11th. On the other hand, Bitcoin maverick and MicroStrategy chief Michael Saylor emphasized his commitment to holding onto MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin in the near future. He pointed out the substantial influx of capital from traditional systems into digital platforms through Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing value compared to assets like gold, real estate, and the S&P Index. Apart from Michael Saylor, other market analysts also believe that Wall Street is trying to corner the Bitcoin market. Blackrock is starting to take creation orders before the 5pm deadline. BTC demand is rock solid. This is not a drill. Wall Street is literally trying to corner the Bitcoin market. If you are short Bitcoin or not holding enough, your window of opportunity is closing. Don't F it up ‚Äî Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) February 20, 2024  CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, reported that earlier this week on Monday, February 19, the Bitcoin whale accumulation addresses received a net inflow of 25,300 BTC in just one day, marking a record-breaking surge. Accumulation addresses are typically those with specific criteria, including no outgoing transactions, a balance exceeding 10 BTC, exclusion of certain address types, and recent activity within the past 7 years. Amid all these developments surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin price remains steady at around $52,000 keeping investors waiting for the next move. Any directional move outside the range of $51,700 and $52,515 would give a clear indication of where is the BTC price heading.

;;;It‚Äôs not every day that a person loses US$6 billion, so when Michael J. Saylor did exactly that in the 2000s at the height of the internet bubble, he definitely made a name for himself. So who exactly is Saylor, what is his current net worth and how exactly did he lose billions back in the day? Let‚Äôs take a quick dive into the crypto king‚Äôs distinctive background. Born in 1965, in Nebraska, US, Saylor‚Äôs childhood was far from average. He grew up in a military family and lived on various US Air Force bases around the world. Graduating as the class valedictorian in high school, the sky was the limit for the young man. Thanks to a full Air Force scholarship, Saylor obtained dual degrees in aeronautics and astronautics, as well as science, technology and society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was also in uni where he met his Theta Delta Chi fraternity brother and future co-founder of MicroStrategy, Sanju K. Bansal. In 1989, at only 24 years old, Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services. Since he couldn‚Äôt fulfil his initial dream of becoming a pilot due to a benign heart murmur diagnosis, the tech whizz focused on his passions for technology, business and the use of computer simulations. Apart from being a dot-com era entrepreneur, Saylor became an author with his New York Times bestseller, The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. He also founded The Saylor Foundation (now called Saylor Academy) to offer free online courses to those who can‚Äôt afford them. He could throw quite the bash too, organising infamous themed yacht parties. In April 2022, Forbes estimated Saylor‚Äôs net worth at US$1.6 billion. That sounds pretty impressive for a tech exec, but during the 90s dot-com boom when Saylor rose through the ranks, he reached a whopping net worth of US$7 billion. His multibillionaire status, however, didn‚Äôt last long, as it was mostly gone by the turn of the century. In early 2000, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought charges against MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO and two other executives for the company‚Äôs inaccurate reporting of financial results for the preceding two years. They eventually settled with the SEC, but never admitted any wrongdoing. Subsequently, Saylor lost his place in the 10-digit club after MicroStrategy revised its financial results and the dot-com bust then crashed the stock. After 20 years, Saylor put himself on the map again by embracing bitcoin. His belief in the volatile digital currency is so strong that he converted virtually all of MicroStrategy‚Äôs cash into the cryptocurrency and personally bought 17,732 bitcoin for US$175 million. With bitcoin‚Äôs recent plunge, MicroStrategy has lost US$1 billion in investments while Saylor‚Äôs net worth reportedly dropped to around US$500 million. Still, the bitcoin bull is not showing any signs of slowing his buying binge soon. ‚ÄúIn #bitcoin We Trust,‚Äù the CEO of MicroStrategy and crypto king said in a June 13 tweet to his 1.5 million Twitter followers.  ;www.scmp.com;https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3182108/who-bitcoin-billionaire-michael-saylor-microstrategy-ceos;
;;Michael Saylor Warns Public: Avoid Scams Promising Free MicroStrategy Bitcoin;Michael Saylor, the tech titan synonymous with Bitcoin and his massive holdings at MicroStrategy, has issued a warning: the cryptocurrency world is awash in scams, and your beloved Bitcoin might be at risk. Saylor‚Äôs stark revelation comes from the frontline of the battle against fraud. His team, a tireless digital janitorial squad, mops up an astonishing 80 fake YouTube videos every day, each one a meticulously crafted trap for unsuspecting investors. These nefarious schemes, often masquerading as free Bitcoin giveaways or quick-flip money doublers, exploit the names of industry giants like Saylor and MicroStrategy to lend themselves an air of legitimacy. But behind the mask lies a grim reality. Scammers leverage the allure of easy riches and prey on the excitement surrounding recent events like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their tactics are diverse, ranging from enticing ‚Äúengagement rewards‚Äù that lure victims into sending away their crypto to blatantly fake giveaways promising mountains of BTC in exchange for a simple scan of a QR code. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è There is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn‚Äôt give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode. My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated @YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don‚Äôt trust, verify. pic.twitter.com/gqZkQW02Ji ‚Äî Michael Saylor‚ö°Ô∏è (@saylor) January 13, 2024  ‚ÄúThere is no risk-free way to double your Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor cautions. This golden rule, often lost in the frenzy of the cryptosphere, should resonate with every investor. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. MicroStrategy, with its record-breaking Bitcoin reserves, makes a particularly juicy target for these digital grifters. Saylor points out that his company‚Äôs reputation is constantly being hijacked to lend credibility to elaborate scams. This underscores the need for extreme caution, especially when encountering offers involving prominent figures or companies in the space. But the threat extends beyond MicroStrategy. The arrival of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, much anticipated by the industry, has Saylor worried about an impending wave of new scams. With the influx of non-crypto-native investors eager to jump on the bandwagon, scammers will have a fresh pool of potential victims to exploit. Michael Saylor isn‚Äôt the only one raising the alarm. The Ripple ecosystem, long plagued by scam accusations, has further fueled concerns about YouTube‚Äôs role in hosting and allowing these illicit activities to flourish. The platform‚Äôs lax approach to policing its content has drawn sharp criticism, leaving many to wonder if enough is being done to protect investors.

;;MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet produces over 300% gain for investors in 2023;"                                                                                                                    In this article MicroStrategy
was founded almost 35 years ago and existed for most of its history as a little-known software company focused on business intelligence. But in 2023, the stock has soared 337%, making it one of the biggest gainers in the U.S. among companies valued at $5 billion or more, topping Nvidia‚Äôs
234% rally and Meta‚Äôs
194% surge. Unlike its tech peers, which rely on revenue growth and market share gains to fuel their stock prices, MicroStrategy‚Äôs
investor appeal is almost exclusively due to bitcoin
. The company began buying the cryptocurrency in mid-2020 and has since amassed roughly 174,530 bitcoins, worth about $7.65 billion as of late Friday. Wall Street is so enamored by the story that the stock has about doubled bitcoin‚Äôs gain this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really bitcoin,‚Äù said Joseph Vafi, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has a buy recommendation on the stock. ‚ÄúAll the other stuff is healthy and doing a good job, they‚Äôre not neglecting it. It‚Äôs doing well, it‚Äôs leading software in its sector. But it‚Äôs basically something we don‚Äôt have to worry about.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap is $8.5 billion, meaning 90% of its valued is tied directly to its bitcoin holdings. When bitcoin plummets or soars, so does MicroStrategy. In 2022, bitcoin‚Äôs 64% drop pushed MicroStrategy down 74%. Even after its huge pop this year, MicroStrategy shares are still below where they were trading at their high in 2021, during peak crypto. The bitcoin strategy dates back to July 2020, when the company said it would start putting some of its cash towards alternative assets, including digital currencies. At the time, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $1.1 billion, built on a software business that had been shrinking since 2015. Annual revenue was just under $500 million, and profit was minimal. At the halfway point of 2020, MicroStrategy had just over $530 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Co-founder Michael Saylor, who was CEO at the time, saw that money sitting virtually idle on the sidelines due to low interest rates and wanted to put it to work. From there, he had to decide whether equities, precious metals or bitcoin would be the best use of funds. ‚ÄúThe reason we decided to buy bitcoin is because bitcoin represents a form of digital gold,‚Äù Saylor said on the first earnings call after the company announced its strategy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder than gold. It‚Äôs smarter, it‚Äôs stronger, it‚Äôs faster than gold.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs decision created a way for investors to have stake in bitcoin through routine purchases of stock, rather than having to buy the coins directly. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO last year and assumed the role of executive chairman, told CNBC‚Äôs Morgan Brennan last week that he expects the bull market in bitcoin to continue next year. He said 99.9% of the capital in the world is invested in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities, with only 0.1% allocated toward bitcoin. ‚ÄúPeople, as they get educated on digital assets, are realizing that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to this digital asset and so they‚Äôre moving from .1 to .2%,‚Äù said Saylor, who co-authored a book about bitcoin last year titled ‚ÄúWhat is Money?‚Äù MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt the first company to put some of its cash pile into alternative investments, and it‚Äôs not the last to look for ways to generate outsized returns on that money. Earlier this month, GameStop gave CEO Ryan Cohen, who gained minor celebrity status as an investor, permission to use company cash to purchase stock. But MicroStrategy is unique in that it‚Äôs become viewed almost exclusively as a bitcoin holding company. ‚ÄúMichael Saylor‚Äôs kind of a visionary,‚Äù said Vafi. ‚ÄúHe saw this as an opportunity to really exploit the fact that they had a lot of cash and a pristine balance sheet and start this bitcoin treasury experiment. And it‚Äôs worked out well and so they‚Äôre continuing down that path.‚Äù In analyzing why MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has so dramatically outperformed bitcoin this year, Vafi described it as a ‚Äúscarcity premium,‚Äù because there are limited ways for equity investors to tap the market. That‚Äôs potentially changing in the new year, as investors gear up for a flurry of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, there are bitcoin futures ETFs, which are comprised of contracts to buy and sell bitcoin but not of the cryptocurrency itself. And investors can buy into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust
, a fund that owns bitcoin and trades over the counter rather than on a major exchange. Grayscale sued the SEC last year after the regulator denied its application to create a spot bitcoin ETF on concerns about investor protections. In August of this year, an appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale, a decision than many in the industry viewed as paving the way for a new crop of ETFs. Asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have filed with the SEC for their own products.  Vafi said the prospect of competition poses little threat to MicroStrategy. ‚ÄúI call it right now a very high-class problem to a certain degree,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf a bitcoin ETF gets approved, the price of bitcoin is probably headed higher and potentially materially higher.‚Äù MicroStrategy also presents more than just a bet on the direction of bitcoin. While ETFs are passively managed, MicroStrategy has the option to put its bitcoin holdings to work, using them, for example, as collateral to create more business opportunities. ‚ÄúMicroStrategy is encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment around bitcoin as well as the increased institutional demand that we are seeing today,‚Äù Shirish Jajodia, the company‚Äôs vice president of treasury and investor relations, told CNBC in an email. ‚ÄúWe do believe it will have a positive impact on the adoption of bitcoin by mainstream investors as well as corporations.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs software business is a big plus too, Saylor said on the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call. It‚Äôs a proven cash flow generator, enabling the company to buy more bitcoin, he said. For the many investors betting against MicroStrategy, it‚Äôs been a tough year. As of early December, crypto stock short sellers were down $6.1 billion for the year, with the rally in Coinbase
hurting them the most, according to S3 Partners. In the first three quarters of the year, short sellers spent $2.19 billion covering their bets, the firm said, with the majority of the buying in Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Short sellers this year have lost $4 billion on Coinbase and $1.4 billion on MicroStrategy, according to data provided by S3 last week. Some 23% of MicroStrategy‚Äôs shares available to the public are shorted, S3 said, which is second highest among crypto companies, behind only bitcoin miner Marathon Digital
. The average for U.S. stocks is 5%. MicroStrategy shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to snapping pu bitcoin. The company said it purchased roughly 16,130 bitcoins in November for over $593 million, even with the price continuing to rise. That‚Äôs more bitcoin than it‚Äôs bought in any full quarter since the first three months of 2021. ‚Äî CNBC‚Äôs Kate Dore contributed to this report WATCH: Bitcoin bounces back above $43,000 Got a confidential news tip?

First, read the course syllabus. Then, enroll in the course by clicking ""Enroll me"". Click Unit 1 to read its introduction and learning outcomes. You will then see the learning materials and instructions on how to use them. What went wrong with money in the past? Why were some goods chosen to become money over others? In this unit, we explore how money serves as a coordination tool for society and how it arises in a bottom-up, spontaneous order. We also explore government intervention in the market for money. We will also discuss monetary history, what makes a good money, and why Bitcoin is well-placed to supersede prior forms of money. We will also talk about deflation and ""hoarding"", and Bitcoin's environmental impact. Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours. Why buy and hold Bitcoin? If you simply save in your local fiat currency (USD, GBP, EUR, and so on), you will be losing value over time. In this unit, we will explore this concept and why many people are now turning to Bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from the ""melting ice cube"" of fiat money. We will also explore Bitcoin's volatility, and whether it must be used as a medium of exchange in the short term to be viable. Bitcoin is moving through phases of evolution, and broadly remains uncorrelated with other assets. Bitcoin detractors also call it a Ponzi scheme or a bubble, or assert that the government will ban it. We will also address these topics. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Bitcoin wasn't formed in a vacuum. There's a rich history of cypherpunks, privacy activists, and free-market libertarians who contributed to the preceding culture and technologies. In this unit, we will contrast Bitcoin with predecessor technologies and businesses, such as BitGold, b-money, HashCash, and e-gold. Bitcoin has also faced various tests in terms of social attacks that have forced a response from the Bitcoin community to defend or strengthen Bitcoin. One interesting case is SegWit2X, where large Bitcoin businesses and miners attempted a hostile takeover of Bitcoin that was repelled by Bitcoin users. Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours. Bitcoin has various technical ingredients that combine to provide extraordinary properties not seen in any other form of money available today. First, Bitcoin's immutable ledger enables transactions that are extremely hard to reverse or tamper with. Bitcoin mining also provides a link between real-world energy expenditure and the security of Bitcoin's ledger. Holding your own Bitcoin private keys enables the user to have custody of their own Bitcoins and control them exclusively. Finally, running a Bitcoin node allows users to fully self-validate their Bitcoins and ensure that the rules of Bitcoin are upheld. In this unit, we will also explore some of the trade-offs of Bitcoin against altcoins, and explore how Bitcoin has no leaders but still continues to advance and develop. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Now that you have some base awareness of Bitcoin, we will cover basic instruction on putting Bitcoin into practice in this unit. This includes acquiring Bitcoin, using a Bitcoin wallet and the Lightning Network, privacy and security practices, and avoiding common pitfalls, scams, and mistakes. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Please take a few minutes to give us feedback about this course.

;;Michael Saylor on the Coming Cryptocurrency Era;"                                          TABLE OF CONTENTS In this article, we‚Äôll examine why Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin is the up-and-coming digital gold, what the implications of that are, and why you should get in on the action now. As MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor puts it,  ‚ÄúIf God came down and created perfect gold, he would create 21 million gold coins, put them on a network that you could move at the speed of light if you wanted to, and make it impossible for anyone to create any more gold. He‚Äôd make it impossible for a bank to steal your gold. He‚Äôd make it impossible for anyone to lie to you about how much gold they had in the vault. He‚Äôd make it completely transparent when he gave it to you. That‚Äôs what Bitcoin is. It‚Äôs digital gold designed with all of the attributes that we love about gold with none of the liabilities.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs company has moved its treasury into Bitcoin and now owns almost 71,000 bitcoins.If you are a crypto enthusiast looking to expand your passport portfolio by adding crypto-friendly countries or diversifying your assets, get in touch with us today. We can help you go where you‚Äôre treated best. Michael Saylor wasn‚Äôt always a fan of Bitcoin. He felt it was just online gambling and not something he needed or really even understood. However, with the lockdowns and changes brought about by the pandemic, he began to reassess what he knew about finance and economics. The challenges of the pandemic brought an aggressive fiscal response by central banks around the world. The real result of that was that the money supply, which had been expanding by 5% every year, started expanding by 20-25% during this year.  As Michael noted, what happens when the cost of capital goes to 15% is that companies will need to change how they‚Äôre operating in order to get bigger returns to keep up. The 8% returns from our current market will not be enough. The only way you get over the hurdle rate is to either grow 20%, like Amazon, Google, or Facebook or to leverage up. You have to borrow billions, buy back stock, cut your share count in half, and that will leverage up your cash flows which are growing less than that cost of capital.  When the monetary supplies are expanding at 15% a year, that shakes people out of their comfort zone and into a search for something new. That‚Äôs how Michael Saylor discovered Bitcoin. He needed a safe haven asset that was not pegged to fiat cash flows.  He has compared owning Bitcoin to owning a block of Manhattan in cyberspace. It‚Äôs a long-duration, safe-haven asset. You can‚Äôt debase it. It‚Äôs not a fiat-based derivative like a bond or a stock.  So, if you‚Äôre looking to the long term, Michael Saylor says owning Bitcoin is like encrypting your monetary energy in a way that will preserve it without any degradation over the long term. Michael Saylor predicts that we‚Äôll start seeing an avalanche of smart CEOs and high-net-worth individuals switching over to Bitcoin.  So, Michael Saylor‚Äôs answer to what will happen when countries start to join in and want to regulate the cryptocurrency market was to ask how many years you have in your life ‚Äì because you‚Äôre wasting time not joining the next technological advancement.  As more people and then governments get involved, regulation will most likely be a part of it, and that might not be all bad. For many, regulations bring trust and ensure legitimacy ‚Äì which then brings more investors. He feels that if he shows you something with 200% returns a year ‚Äì while the average returns are 10% a year and the best returns are 20% a year ‚Äì if you wait to join in, you‚Äôre giving up the opportunity to progress. According to Saylor, gold is antiquated monetary storage that peaked in the 19th century. It‚Äôs not working now. The reason it doesn‚Äôt work is that you can corrupt it, you can confiscate it, can hypothecate it, and lie about it, and it‚Äôs impractical to move it with you should you decide you want to change locations. It no longer works in our digital age. Nomad Capitalist has helped 1,500+ high-net-worth clients grow and protect their wealth safe from high taxes and greedy governments. Learn how our legal, holistic approach can help you. It‚Äôs being replaced by something better ‚Äì something that moves at the speed of light and is pure monetary energy.  ‚ÄúYou can cling to gold, but it‚Äôs like clinging to your Kodak stock because you like photos instead of buying Apple. Or like Rand McNally maps compared to Google maps.‚Äù  The digital version is not a speculative asset but a digital monetary network that works better than the physical and paper monetary networks they‚Äôre replacing.  Let us know your goal and we will tell you how we can help you based on your details. REDUCE TAXES OFFSHORE CREATE A GLOBAL PLAN B DIVERSIFY AND PROTECT WEALTH                     Michael Saylor urges individuals and countries that want to prosper to embrace this new digital monetary network. In terms of the future, he claims the best thing you can do is to make yourself and your property mobile.  For him, things like real estate, stocks, bonds, and even companies can lose their value or cause you to be stuck in one location. He urges you to own the most movable, liquid property on earth ‚Äì Bitcoin. Another hottest commodity of this age is a second passport.

investor, is acquiring more BTC amid the recent cryptocurrency market recovery. BTC $51,238 MicroStrategy co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor took to Twitter on March 27 to announce that the firm has repaid its $205 million loan to Silvergate. Citing a form 8-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Saylor stressed that MicroStrategy repaid the Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. The company also acquired a significant stash of Bitcoin, purchasing 6,455 BTC for $150 million, or at an average price of $23,238 per coin as of March 23, the former CEO said. According to the filing, MicroStrategy acquired its latest batch of Bitcoin between Feb. 16, 2023 and March 23, 2023. With the purchase, MicroStrategy has increased its total Bitcoins holdings to 138,955 BTC, bought for $4.1 billion at an average of $29,817 per coin, Saylor said. As previously announced, MicroStrategy‚Äôs subsidiary MacroStrategy received a $205 million term loan from Silvergate Bank under its Silvergate Exchange Network Leverage program in March 2022. The loan was collateralized by certain Bitcoin owned by MacroStrategy and had a scheduled maturity date of March 23, 2025. Under the terms of the credit agreement, MacroStrategy was required to maintain a loan to collateral value ratio of less than 50%. On March 24, 2023, MacroStrategy and Silvergate entered into a prepayment, waiver and payoff to credit and security agreement, with MacroStrategy voluntarily prepaying Silvergate around $161 million in full repayment. ‚ÄúUpon Silvergate‚Äôs receipt of the payoff amount, the credit agreement was terminated, and Silvergate released its security interest in all of MacroStrategy‚Äôs assets collateralizing the loan, including the Bitcoin that was serving as collateral,‚Äù the filing reads.

;;Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Potential Tenfold Surge;Bitcoin (BTC) has reignited optimism in the cryptocurrency market through its recent surge. The leading cryptocurrency experienced a substantial upswing, dragging other digital assets along with it. Nonetheless, several notable figures in the industry are of the opinion that Bitcoin is at the initial stages of a remarkable journey. One of these figures is Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy. In a recent CNBC interview, Saylor conveyed his conviction that BTC is on the verge of a price rally that could leave a lasting mark on contemporary financial history. Saylor‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential is firmly grounded and has been reinforced by MicroStrategy‚Äôs third-quarter earnings report. He left no room for ambiguity when he declared, ‚ÄúYou can never have too much Bitcoin.‚Äù  What underpins Saylor‚Äôs optimism is a convergence of forthcoming events within the Bitcoin ecosystem. These events have the potential to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape. One pivotal factor on the horizon is the upcoming ‚Äúhalving‚Äù event scheduled for April 2024. This event will reduce BTC mining rewards by 50%, effectively curbing the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the market. Saylor elucidated this point by stating, ‚ÄúWe will witness a reduction from $12 billion of natural selling per year to $6 billion per year.‚Äù This decrease in supply will foster scarcity and stimulate increased demand, potentially driving up the value of Bitcoin. Additionally, Saylor highlighted the mounting anticipation surrounding spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) within the Wall Street domain. These ETFs are expected to generate augmented buying pressure, paving the way for broader, mainstream investment in cryptocurrency. There are rumors circulating that the inaugural spot Bitcoin ETF could receive regulatory approval as early as Christmas. This further marks a momentous milestone in the cryptocurrency‚Äôs integration into the traditional financial markets. Saylor highlighted the need for the cryptocurrency industry to evolve and mature. The Bitcoin bull emphasized that the industry should transition to ‚Äúadult supervision‚Äù in order to progress. He expressed his concerns regarding the proliferation of the vast number of crypto tokens, which currently stands at over 100,000. Saylor believes that many of these tokens are being manipulated to divert attention away from Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. Saylor‚Äôs perspective is that the industry needs to refocus its attention on Bitcoin, the most established and widely recognized cryptocurrency. He argues that by moving away from the distraction and speculative nature of numerous ‚Äúshiny little tokens,‚Äù the industry can realize its true potential. Saylor predicts that such a shift in focus and increased maturity within the sector could result in a tenfold growth from the current state. Furthermore, the synergy of these factors is what underlies Saylor‚Äôs optimistic outlook for Bitcoin in the upcoming year. He believes that the surge in demand, combined with the reduction in supply, presents an extraordinary and unparalleled opportunity for the asset.

According to analysts at Bernstein, Bitcoin could experience a remarkable 337% upswing, potentially reaching $150,000 by mid-2025. The report, spearheaded by Global Digital Senior Analyst Gautam Chhugani, acknowledges that while not everyone may share the same level of enthusiasm for Bitcoin, it underscores the critical role of timing within the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a tendency to rally during halving events. Also Read: Bitcoin Forecasted to Triple in Price, Reach $150,000 in 18 Months While the cryptocurrency market is renowned for its volatility, Saylor‚Äôs optimism and the backing from industry analysts indicate that exciting developments may be on the horizon for Bitcoin.

Unfortunately there was only a 3 minute clip on the primetime show, but Carlson and Saylor had an hour-long conversation that was available to Fox subscribers on Tucker Carlson, Today. I found the entire video interview on BitChute for free, which I‚Äôve embedded for you to watch. This video is worth a watch because Saylor tends to do a great job explaining Bitcoin. He uses comparison and analogies that I find to be useful, especially for beginners. I‚Äôve included a bit more context below to help you understand why this is such a great video to share with friends and family. Michael Saylor has purchased almost 3 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin with his public company, MicroStrategy. Earlier in the day (before the video recording), they announced that they had purchased another $400m worth. Saylor personally owns 17,000 Bitcoins as well. Here‚Äôs a tweet where he talks about this. Some have asked how much #BTC I own. I personally #hodl 17,732 BTC which I bought at $9,882 each on average. I informed MicroStrategy of these holdings before the company decided to buy #bitcoin for itself. Michael Saylor has given a lot of interviews and regularly talks on podcasts, video networks, and has even created a website called Hope.com to outline Bitcoin and why it matters. In this video Tucker said that they searched for years to find someone who can explain Bitcoin, and I can see why they chose Michael Saylor. Michael Saylor used to be a Bitcoin critic. Here‚Äôs a tweet of him in 2013 saying that Bitcoin‚Äôs days are numbered: #Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling. He also wrote a book back in 2012 where he predicted the rise of mobile phones and how big of a deal it would be. I‚Äôm sharing this to outline how Michael Saylor tends to understand major trends that shape society. Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality in conservative circles. Michael Saylor is an established public-company CEO who loves to explain Bitcoin and why it matters. I recommend you share this video with family and friends who watch Fox News! ;www.lukethomas.com;https://www.lukethomas.com/michael-saylor-tucker-carlson-full-video-free/;
;;Michael Saylor Issues Warning on Rising Bitcoin Frauds;In light of the increasing number of frauds utilizing Bitcoin, Michael Saylor, Chairman of MicroStrategy Incorporated, has delivered an emphatic caution to the crypto community. A twitter post made public by Saylor reveals that MicroStrategy and his fame are often used to defraud individuals. Also, according to the Chairman, whose fake image and details are often used by scammers, he and his colleagues remove over 80 fraudulent YouTube videos per day that promote various types of fraud. Moreover, community members should be aware that MicroStrategy does not provide free Bitcoin to anyone who just scans barcodes, as he cautioned. This caution follows an increasing fraud model in which con artists ask victims to prove their devotion or commitment in exchange for a chance to win prizes. Scammers often utilize the tactic of asking naive victims to deposit funds into a special wallet with the promise that their money would be doubled within a short period of time (sometimes minutes or hours). Many people in the sector continue to fall for these scams, even if they seem too good to be true. Michael Saylor commented on this, saying that contrary to popular belief, there is no foolproof method for anybody to double their Bitcoin. Given the business‚Äôs current position in the community, MicroStrategy is a prime target. Also, it is the biggest non-crypto-focused firm by Bitcoin ownership. Following years of aggressive building up, MicroStrategy acquired 14,620 BTC for over $615.7 million in late December 2023, bringing its total holdings to 189,150 BTC.

;;Bitcoin‚Äôs Demand to Skyrocket Tenfold, Says Michael Saylor;  Sign up Sign in Abiodun Ajayi Follow InsiderFinance Wire 64   The co-founder of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, is optimistic that the coming year will witness a groundbreaking period, not only for Bitcoin but also for the entire financial landscape. Saylor, who serves as the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, reasserted his strong support for BTC during an interview with CNBC. He firmly believes that Bitcoin is on the verge of experiencing a price surge that is unprecedented in the history of modern finance. Saylor‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential is rooted in several upcoming events related to the cryptocurrency. Firstly, BTC is scheduled to undergo a ‚Äúhalving‚Äù event in April, which will reduce the rewards received by BTC miners by 50%. This reduction is expected to significantly limit the influx of newly mined BTC into the market. Furthermore, speculations are circulating within the financial industry that the first-ever spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), a long-awaited development yet to receive approval from U.S. regulators, may finally be authorized as early as Christmas. This approval would open the doors for more mainstream investors to access and invest in cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling a year ‚Äî at the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor said of the near-term BTC climate. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why all of us are fairly bullish over the next 12 months: demand‚Äôs going to increase, supply‚Äôs going to contract, and this is fairly unprecedented in the history of Wall Street.‚Äù Saylor elaborated on his conviction that with significant investments from major financial institutions, centralized entities will not only bring stability to BTC but also play a role in bolstering the entire cryptocurrency sector, resulting in a substantial increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Saylor expressed, ‚ÄúAs Wall Street banks and trustworthy custodians take charge of BTC, and the industry shifts its focus away from the various speculative tokens that have diverted attention and eroded shareholder value, I believe the industry will advance to a new level, and we could see a tenfold increase from our current position.‚Äù BTC has experienced a notable upswing in recent weeks. Towards the end of the previous month, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable 11% surge, reaching $31,000, largely driven by the excitement surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. This upward momentum has persisted, reaching its zenith at $35,878 in the past week, marking a new record for the year 2023. At the time of writing, according to CoinGecko, BTC is currently valued at $34,903. In a noteworthy development earlier this week, Bernstein, an investment research firm that had previously been skeptical about BTC‚Äôs potential, made a bullish prediction. They forecasted that, given the genuine possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF gaining approval, the cryptocurrency could reach a value of $150,000 by the year 2025. It‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high was achieved in November 2021, when it briefly exceeded $69,000. Thanks for being a part of our community! Before you go: Distraction-free reading.

;;Don‚Äôt Fall for the Double Your Bitcoin Scam Stealing Crypto;"Written by: Stelian Pilici Published on: November 2, 2023 Promises of doubling your Bitcoin may sound tempting, but beware. Websites offering to magically multiply your crypto are scams designed to steal your funds. This article exposes the deceptive techniques used in the ‚ÄúDouble Your Bitcoin‚Äù scam so you can identify the warning signs and protect your cryptocurrency.  This Article Contains: The Double Your Bitcoins scam operates through fraudulent websites that lure victims with bold promises like ‚ÄúDouble your Bitcoin today!‚Äù or ‚ÄúEarn 10X returns on your crypto!‚Äù These sites entice users to send cryptocurrency deposits with the false promise of returning exponentially multiplied funds later. However, it‚Äôs simply a deception aimed at stealing digital assets. To appear more legitimate, many scammers exploit famous personalities and brands. For example, a scam site may feature images of Elon Musk or use Tesla branding without permission. Copy might read ‚ÄúElon Musk is giving away free crypto!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTesla is doubling Bitcoin deposits for a limited time!‚Äù This tactic relies on the public‚Äôs trust in these elite figures to make the con appear credible and solvent. Other scam sites feature names and photos of celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet, or Chamath Palihapitiya. Their identities provide an air of credibility. Scammers think posts stating ‚ÄúZuckerberg is tripling any Bitcoin you send for 24 hours only!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWarren Buffet is giving away $10 million in BTC!‚Äù will dupe unsuspecting victims. Of course, these famous billionaires never actually endorse any Double Your Bitcoin scams. All statements and affiliations are completely fabricated without consent. But for the average user, it can be convincing to see global celebrities purportedly guaranteeing amazing crypto returns.  Beyond fake celebrity ties, plenty of other red flags should make these investment sites highly suspicious: Reality is the scammers behind most Double Your Bitcoin cons operate anonymously. They use fabricated personas, addresses, and corporate details. This prevents angry victims and authorities from tracking them down. Many scam sites also try to come across as legal businesses meeting compliance standards. But further inspection reveals the company info they list is utterly false. Any licenses or documentation is made up. This prevents holding the scammers legally accountable. So in summary, don‚Äôt fall for the Double Your Bitcoin scam no matter what trusting personalities they associate themselves with. Their fraudulent sites have no relation to actual celebrities. And their investment promises are a mirage designed to surreptitiously steal your hard-earned cryptocurrency. The fraudsters behind Double Your Bitcoin scams rely on social engineering techniques to manipulate and deceive victims. Their sites are specifically designed to exploit human psychology and emotions like greed, fear of missing out (FOMO), and risk-taking. Here is a step-by-step look at how these scams work to steal cryptocurrency: The first point of contact is often through ads on social platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. Scammers will place paid ads promoting huge crypto earnings. When victims click these ads, they get funneled directly to the scam site. Referral links posted on forums, in Telegram groups or sent via email also bypass search engines and send users straight to the scammer‚Äôs site. Once on the site, users see claims of being able to ‚Äúdouble your Bitcoin in just 24 hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúEarn 10x returns on your crypto deposits‚Äù. These statements promise way above market returns and appeal strongly to human greed and desires for wealth. Fake reviews, testimonials and income statements further reinforce that users can earn huge profits quickly by sending crypto deposits first. After highlighting the potential for enormous profits, the scam site provides a crypto wallet address and instructs users to deposit funds. Often they emphasize that to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù bonuses, take advantage of ‚Äúlimited time offers‚Äù or earn the advertised returns, you must send crypto first. Some tricks used to encourage deposits: Once the scammers have collected deposits in their wallet, victims never see those funds returned or any profits. The website may show fake balances increasing, fake mining statuses, etc. but no payments ever get sent back. After some time, the scammers take down the site and abscond with the stolen crypto. Victims lose all the cryptocurrency they deposited, which can sometimes be their life savings. Here are detailed sections on how to spot the Double Your Bitcoin scam on Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok, including examples. The content is optimized for SEO and readability. Many Double Your Bitcoin scam websites illegally exploit famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk to fabricate false credibility. By using celebrity names and brands without permission, these crypto scammers aim to manipulate victims into trusting their platforms. For example, a fraudulent site may claim ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs Tesla Wallet will double your BTC deposits instantly!‚Äù using Elon‚Äôs photo. Another site might state ‚ÄúElon Musk is giving away 5000 free Bitcoins to the first 1000 people who sign up today!‚Äù These sites take advantage of Elon Musk‚Äôs public image as a visionary innovator and cryptocurrency supporter. By falsely implying endorsement or involvement from Musk, scammers hope victims will believe their lies and send crypto deposits. In reality, Elon Musk and Tesla have no association with any Bitcoin doubling scams. No mainstream celebrity or corporation is partnering with these criminal schemes to multiply cryptocurrency. Any site associate a famous name like Elon Musk with doubling Bitcoin or crypto giveaways is 100% fraudulent. Other well-known figures scammers exploit include: Scam sites will claim these famous entrepreneurs are ‚Äúbacking‚Äù or ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù new Bitcoin doublers. Some even photoshop celebrity images receiving large crypto payouts from the scammers themselves. This social engineering provides victims a false sense of security right before the fraudsters steal their deposits. The bottom line is no major celebrity has endorsed or invested in any platform doubling cryptocurrency. Online users should immediately become suspicious if a site uses a famous person to promote improbable crypto returns. These scammers are only leveraging unethical tricks to defraud real victims. The scammers behind the Double Your Bitcoin scam aggressively promote their fraudulent websites on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok. Here are some tips to identify these scam ads and posts: For example, an ad might read ‚ÄúDouble your BTC in 24 hours! Click now before this exclusive opportunity disappears!‚Äù But the link actually redirects to a scam site called ‚Äúbtc-doubler.co‚Äù instead of a legitimate company page. For example, a post may use Elon Musk‚Äôs image claiming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving away 5000 BTC! First come first serve!‚Äù But the account name is ‚Äú@mr_elunmusk‚Äù instead of the real ‚Äú@elonmusk‚Äù verified account. For example, a video might claim ‚ÄúDeposit 0.1 BTC and get 1 full BTC sent back instantly!‚Äù But the comments are full of bots saying ‚ÄúI got rich so fast, best method ever!‚Äù The above tips can help users across Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok recognize the hallmarks of the Double Your Bitcoin scam. Stay vigilant and always verify dubious claims before sending any money or cryptocurrency. While ads and social media posts may direct victims to scam platforms, learning how to recognize fraudulent Bitcoin doubler sites is key to avoiding this trap. Here are some tips: For example, a site might be titled ‚Äúbest-bitcoinmultiplier.site‚Äù with a homepage claiming ‚ÄúDouble your BTC every 6 hours! Deposit now to reserve your profits!‚Äù But the About Us page is lorem ipsum placeholder text. Stay vigilant and think critically before depositing any crypto. Cross reference scam techniques to avoid becoming another victim of malicious Bitcoin doubling websites. If you have fallen prey to the Double Your Bitcoin scam and deposited crypto into one of these fraudulent websites, take the following steps immediately: If you have sent crypto once and are being pressured to send more to ‚Äúunlock your balance‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplete verification‚Äù, cease all transactions. The scam site will never pay out no matter how much more you deposit. Cut your losses and stop sending more money. Use a blockchain explorer tool to look up the wallet address you sent funds to. Monitor this address to see if the scammers cash out your crypto to exchanges or other wallets. This info can help law enforcement potentially track them down. Report the scam site, wallet addresses and any other related info to authorities such as the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Provide as many specifics as possible. The more victims who report, the higher priority these scams become for prosecution. If you purchased the crypto you deposited on major exchanges, contact their fraud departments. Alert them to the scam wallet addresses so they can potentially blacklist them from trading. If you reused passwords across the scam site and your other crypto exchange/wallet accounts, change them immediately. Also setup two-factor authentication (2FA) if you haven‚Äôt already for enhanced security. Spread awareness about the scam to prevent more victims. Post on social channels, forums, contact publishers of referral links, etc. The more the crypto community calls out these scams, the less people will fall for them. Depending on the amount stolen, you may want to explore legal avenues to try recovering funds or taking civil/criminal action against the scammers. A lawyer can advise you on viable options based on your specific case. Many people have questions about the ‚ÄúDouble Your Bitcoin‚Äù websites and how these crypto scams operate. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: The Double Your Bitcoin scam involves fraudulent websites that entice victims to send cryptocurrency deposits with the false promise of receiving doubled or multiplied returns. However, once victims send funds to the provided wallet addresses, the scammers steal their money. Scammers rely heavily on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to promote their scam sites. They use paid ads, fake accounts, bots, and referral links to direct victims to their fraudulent platforms. These fraudsters exploit human psychology and emotions like greed, fear of missing out, and risk-taking. Their sites feature fake reviews, celebrity endorsements, urgency tactics, and other social engineering tricks to manipulate victims. No, absolutely not. There is no legitimate way to double complex assets like cryptocurrency in just hours or days. Any site promising such outrageous returns is guaranteed to be a scam. Red flags include impossible returns, fake testimonials, celebrity photos, lack of company details, pressure to act fast, grammatical errors, and no maximum deposit limits. Immediately cease sending more funds. Report the site to authorities, notify your crypto exchanges, change account passwords, and consult a lawyer about legal options. Unfortunately recovery is very rare since the scammers remain anonymous. But reporting improves chances of identifying the criminals. Avoiding the scam in the first place is the best option. Yes, scamming people out of cryptocurrency is illegal. However, because the fraudsters hide their identities, they are rarely caught and prosecuted. Report scam sites, wallet addresses, and related details to the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and other local authorities. Be skeptical of promised crypto returns exceeding market averages. Check site reputation through reviews and domain/hosting history. Enable 2FA on your accounts and choose strong passwords. The bottom line is that the Double Your Bitcoin scam is exactly that ‚Äì a scam designed to separate victims from their cryptocurrency. No website can magically double complex assets in just hours or days. Any platform making such outrageous claims should be considered highly suspicious. Remember the old saying: ‚ÄúIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù Be very wary of promised crypto returns that far exceed realistic market gains. Also be skeptical of any site asking for deposits upfront in exchange for amazing profits later. Conduct due diligence on any investment opportunity and never send funds on blind faith alone. Stick to established, reputable platforms and be extra cautious around advertisers promising fast crypto riches. With crypto scams on the rise, it pays to be proactive about securing your coins. Enable 2FA on all accounts, choose strong passwords, monitor your wallet addresses and be vigilant against phishing attempts. Only you can protect your cryptocurrency from scammers. The Double Your Bitcoin scam exploits human psychology including greed and fear of missing out. But armed with knowledge of how this scam works, you can identify the warning signs and avoid becoming another victim. Spread the word so that together we can combat cryptocurrency fraud. Here are 10 basic security tips to help you avoid malware and protect your device: Use a good antivirus and keep it up-to-date. It's essential to use a good quality antivirus and keep it up-to-date to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. We are huge fans of Malwarebytes Premium and use it on all of our devices, including Windows and Mac computers as well as our mobile devices. Malwarebytes sits beside your traditional antivirus, filling in any gaps in its defenses, and providing extra protection against sneakier security threats. Keep software and operating systems up-to-date. Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Whenever an update is released for your device, download and install it right away. These updates often include security fixes, vulnerability patches, and other necessary maintenance. Be careful when installing programs and apps. Pay close attention to installation screens and license agreements when installing software. Custom or advanced installation options will often disclose any third-party software that is also being installed. Take great care in every stage of the process and make sure you know what it is you're agreeing to before you click ""Next."" Install an ad blocker. Use a browser-based content blocker, like AdGuard. Content blockers help stop malicious ads, Trojans, phishing, and other undesirable content that an antivirus product alone may not stop. Be careful what you download. A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware‚Äîprograms or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. Be alert for people trying to trick you. Whether it's your email, phone, messenger, or other applications, always be alert and on guard for someone trying to trick you into clicking on links or replying to messages. Remember that it's easy to spoof phone numbers, so a familiar name or number doesn't make messages more trustworthy. Back up your data. Back up your data frequently and check that your backup data can be restored. You can do this manually on an external HDD/USB stick, or automatically using backup software. This is also the best way to counter ransomware. Never connect the backup drive to a computer if you suspect that the computer is infected with malware. Choose strong passwords. Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don't use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it's important to follow these 10 basic safety rules. By doing so, you can protect yourself from many of the unpleasant surprises that can arise when using the web.

;;Bitcoin ETF Hype Reaches New Heights;"Sign up for FREE to get full unrestricted access to all of our digital asset news and the stories that matter in Singapore & APAC. It's time to talk about Bitcoin ETFs again as trading volumes surge 1000% We've been avoiding the elephant in the room for a while now. After a burst of spot Bitcoin ETF updates at the start of the year, we took a break from laboring about the ""revolutionary"" financial products. Not because we're too cool for school but because Bitcoin ETF news quickly became repetitive, dry, and let's be honest, predictable. More importantly, the world of digital assets and Web3 extends far beyond Bitcoin. It was our duty to dig out industry trinkets and uncover any hidden gems that were buried beneath the Bitcoin ETF coverage. We'd like to think we found some for you. You're welcome. We're now revisiting the Bitcoin scene as there have been some new developments that we probably shouldn't overlook. Before we set the ball rolling, and for consistency's sake, a little on Bitcoin's price: BTC has traded relatively sidewise after breaking the $52K barrier. Our in-house analyst believes it could soon hit $55K. VaneEck's spot Bitcoin ETF, also known as HODL, has seen its daily volume exceed $300 million. The figure represents a 1000% increase from its previous peak. Interestingly, the surge was not a result of one or two whales but due to 32,000 individual transactions, marking a 60x increase from its average. The pump has left Bloomberg ETF expert, Eric Balchunas, bewildered. ""Still haven't figured out what happened. No one knows,"" Balchunas tweeted, adding that it could even be social media driven. ""Given how sudden and explosive the increase in number of trades was (500 trades Friday, 50,000 trades today) I'm wondering if some Reddit or TikTok influencer type recommended them to their followers. Feels retail army-ish."" Still haven't figured out what happened. No one knows. Given how sudden and explosive the increase in number of trades was (500 trades Friday, 50,000 trades today) I'm wondering if some Reddit or TikTok influencer type recommended them to their followers. Feels retail army-ish. https://t.co/WazxSSgFjR Until recently, VanEck's Bitcoin ETF has been outperformed by its rivals. Grayscale's $23.76 billion and BlackRock's $5.68 billion dwarf VanEck's $187.55 million. However, VanEck's 24-hour volume of $401.1 million casts a shadow on Fidelity, Ark, and Bitwise, which have only seen $340.2 million, $141.95, and $179.15 million over the same period despite having AUMs over one billion. In response to the swing, VanEck's head of ETF products, Ed Lopez said, ""Because ETFs trade on the secondary market, it can be challenging to know who or why someone buys an ETF. Today‚Äôs trading has sported great volume at tight spreads, which is ultimately what you‚Äôd want from an ETF, whether you're bullish or bearish on the market."" Last week, VanEeck filed a notice with the SEC that it would lower its fee from 0.25% to 0.20%, effective tomorrow, 22 February. VanEck isn't the only fund that has a 24-hour volume higher than its AUM. WisdomTree has seen $223.10 million in volume over the 24-hour period despite having AUM of just $26.41. ""Typically when the daily volume is greater than an ETF's total assets (as in this case) it means one big creation,"" Balchunas explains. ""I've never seen a grassroots trading explosion come out of nowhere like this."" More interesting-ness: $BTCW also popping off, $154m trades, 12x its avg and 25x its assets via 23,000 indiv trades. For context, it saw a mere 221 trades on Friday. At the same time $IBIT volume is elevated but not crazy like this. WTF? ETF Unsolved Mysteries will continue after‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IXQmCKuCWl Volumes in Bitcoin ETFs have amounted to almost $2 billion, which is the highest since its first day of trading back in January. The Nine had biggest volume day since Day One with about $2b in combined trading thx to big contributions from $HODL, $BTCW and $BITB which all broke their personal records. For context $2b in trading would put them in Top 10ish among ETFs and Top 20ish among stocks. It's a lot. pic.twitter.com/547pIl5grI Before the official approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Gemini co-founder  Tyler Winklevoss, told Blockhead that the most exciting aspect of onboarding institutions is liquidity. ""I think the next wave will be ETFs and that's going to bring a ton of liquidity and price discovery,"" Tyler explained. ""We have many institutional customers, and they range from proprietary trading firms to large macro hedge funds,"" he continued. ""And I think we're going to see 10x that once ETFs arrive."" True enough, Bitcoin order books are now the most liquid since October 2023. Bitcoin's 2% market depth across 33 centralized exchanges has risen to $539 million. Bitcoin's 2% market depth measures the aggregated bids and asks on BTC order books and is up 23% since the end of November and by 30% year-over-year to $485mn. ""The increase in liquidity has been driven by U.S. platforms and is likely linked to the spot ETF approvals,"" Kaiko explains. ""The market share of BTC market depth on U.S. vs. global exchanges has increased consistently since November, exceeding 50% since late 2023."" Greater liquidity means easier access and less slippage between trading prices. Bitcoin super bull Michael Saylor believes the cryptocurrency spot ETFs are yet another reason to stay long. The MicroStrategy CEO said, ""The spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem."" ""[The ETFs] are facilitating the digital transformation of capital, and every day hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy."" MicroStrategy bought another 16,130 BTC in December, totaling a balance of 190,000 Bitcoin in January. Saylor isn't intending on selling any of it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever, Bitcoin is the exit strategy,"" he explained, adding that the cryptocurrency is stronger than gold. ‚ÄúWe believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin because Bitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes and that being the case, there‚Äôs just no reason to sell the winner and to buy the losers.‚Äù Looking beyond ETH ETFs, Ethereum's shrinking supply, deflationary position, restaking, and data blobs, are all reasons to back the world's second biggest cryptocurrency Can the Solana Saga 2 and the Aptos-integrated $99 JamboPhone warrant the legitimate need for a Web3 smartphone? Blockhead presents our favorite stories this week, Bitcoin's return to $50K, Ether Rock's potential $600K sale, Coinbase's return to profit, Crypto.com's Hong Kong license application, and Franklin Templeton's ETH ETF race An Ether Rock NFT is expected to fetch $600,000 at a Sotheby's auction but are we in enough of a bull market to justify its price? Avalanche's token unlock could lead to further selling pressure on AVAX. Starknet's STRK token took center stage with its debut this week, but airdrop recipients chose to sell. The guidelines align Hong Kong's regulatory framework with international best practices, positioning the region as a leading global center for digital asset innovation and investment.

;Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:45:49]: Well the interesting thing is: one of those 500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of the automation. So it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs an opportunity for you to think: where is my field, my discipline, evolving into? I talked to a bunch of librarians ‚Äî just happen to be friends with librarians ‚Äî and libraries will probably be evolving, and it‚Äôs up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble.;Michael Saylor: Bitcoin, Inflation, and the Future of Money | Lex Fridman Podcast #276;  Sign up Sign in Stephen Chow Follow 1  Link to the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/mC43pZkpTec Lex Fridman: Let‚Äôs start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems ‚Äî let‚Äôs say 5‚Äì10 centuries from now ‚Äî look back at Earth on this early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about money and economics? Or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence, consciousness ‚Äî all the big, interesting questions? Michael Saylor: I think they would probably give us a B- on engineering, on all the engineering things ‚Äî the hard sciences. Lex Fridman: A passing grade? Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre doing okay! We‚Äôre working our way through rockets and jets and electric cars and electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the like. And if you look at the walls that grace the Great Court at MIT, it‚Äôs full of all the great thinkers and they‚Äôre all pretty admirable. If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie or Einstein, you would respect them. I would say they‚Äôd give us like an F+ or a D- on economics. Lex Fridman: You have an optimistic vision ‚Äî first of all, an optimistic vision of engineering, because most people you‚Äôve listed is just over the past couple of centuries. And maybe it stretches a little farther back, but mostly all the cool stuff we‚Äôve done in engineering is the past couple of centuries. Michael Saylor: I mean, Archimedes had his virtues. I studied the history of science at MIT and I also studied aerospace engineering and so I clearly have a bias in favor of science. And if I look at the past 10,000 years and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics and their impact on the human condition, I think it‚Äôs a wash. For every politician that came up with a good idea, another politician came up with a bad idea. And it‚Äôs not clear to me that most of the political and philosophical contributions to the human race and the human conditions have advanced so much. I mean we‚Äôre still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and Plato and Seneca and the like, and on the other hand, if you think about what has made the human condition better ‚Äî fire, water, harnessing of wind energy ‚Äî like, try to row across an ocean, right? Not easy. Lex Fridman: And for people who are just listening or watching, there‚Äôs a beautiful sexy ship from the 16th-17th century? Michael Saylor: This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century sailing ship which is of the type that the Dutch East India Company used to sail the world and trade. So the original was made sometime in the 1600s, and then this model was made in the 19th century by individuals. Lex Fridman: Both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best. And just imagine ‚Äî just like rockets flying out to space ‚Äî how much hope this filled people with: exploring the unknown, going into the mystery. Both the entrepreneurs and the business people and the engineers and just humans ‚Äî what‚Äôs out there? What‚Äôs out there to be discovered? Michael Saylor: Yeah the metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one. In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy was 50. During the Revolutionary War, while our founding fathers were fighting to establish life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, the Constitution, average life expectancy was somewhere between 32 and 36. So all the sound and the fury doesn‚Äôt make you live past 32, but what does? Antibiotics ‚Äî conquest of infectious diseases. If we understand the science of infectious disease ‚Äî sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70, and that happened fast. That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that. And I think if you look at the human condition ‚Äî you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually keep track of your watts output when you‚Äôre on it? 200 is a lot, okay? 200 is a lot. So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy that a trained athlete can deliver in a day, and probably not 1% of the people in the world could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day. And the commercial value of a kilowatt hour ‚Äî the retail value ‚Äî is 11 cents today, and the wholesale value is 2 cents. So you have to look at the contribution of politicians and philosophers and economists to the human condition, and it‚Äôs like at best a wash ‚Äî one way or the other. And then if you look at the contribution of John D. Rockefeller when he delivered you a barrel of oil and the energy in oil ‚Äî liquid energy ‚Äî or the contribution of Tesla as we deliver electricity. And what‚Äôs the impact of the human condition if I have electric power? If I have chemical power? If I have wind energy? If I can actually set up a reservoir, create a dam, spin a turbine, and generate energy from a hydraulic source? That‚Äôs extraordinary, right? And so our ability to cross the ocean, our ability to grow food, our ability to live ‚Äî it‚Äôs technology that gets the human race from a brutal life where life expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80. Michael Saylor: I think most economic ideas are bad ideas. Like, take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem: design the shape of the hull of that ship, or you want to design an airfoil ‚Äî a wing ‚Äî or if you want to design an engine or a nozzle in a rocket ship. You wouldn‚Äôt do it with simple arithmetic. You wouldn‚Äôt do it with a scalar. There‚Äôs not a single number, right? It‚Äôs vector math. Computational fluid dynamics is n-dimensional higher-level math ‚Äî complicated stuff. So when when an economist says, The inflation rate is 2%, that‚Äôs a scalar. And when an economist says, It‚Äôs not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is very low ‚Äî the monetary velocity is low ‚Äî that‚Äôs another scalar, okay? So the truth of the matter is: inflation is not a scalar. Inflation is an n-dimensional vector. Money velocity is not a scalar. Saying, What‚Äôs the velocity of money? Oh, it‚Äôs slow or it‚Äôs fast ‚Äî it ignores the question of what medium is the money moving through? In the same way that, What‚Äôs the speed of sound? Okay, well what is sound? Sound is a compression wave. It‚Äôs energy moving through a medium. But the speed is different! So for example, the speed of sound through air is different than the speed of sound through water, and sound moves faster through water. It moves faster through a solid and it moves faster through a stiffer solid. So there isn‚Äôt one. Lex Fridman: What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world down to a model? Is it too simple? Or is it just even the first principles of constructing the model is wrong? Michael Saylor: I think that the fundamental problem is: if you see the world as a scalar, you simply pick the one number which supports whatever you want to do, and you ignore the universe of other consequences from your behavior. Lex Fridman: In general ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard of like Eric Weinstein has been talking about this with Gauge theory. So different kinds of approaches from the physics world, from the mathematical world, to extend past this scalar view of economics. So Gauge theory is one way that comes from physics. Do you find that way of exploring economics interesting? So outside of cryptocurrency, outside of the actual technologies and so on, just analysis of how economics works ‚Äî do you find that interesting? Michael Saylor: Yeah I think that if we‚Äôre going to want to really make any scientific progress in economics, we have to apply much more computationally-intensive and richer forms of mathematics. Lex Fridman: So a simulation, perhaps? Michael Saylor: Yeah, when I was at MIT I studied system dynamics ‚Äî they taught it at the Sloan School. It was developed by Jay Forrester, who was an extraordinary computer scientist. And when we‚Äôve created models of economic behavior, they were all multi-dimensional non-linear models. So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world, you have to start with the concept of feedback. If I double the price of something, demand will fall, and attempts to create supply will increase. And there will be a delay before the capacity increases, there‚Äôll be an instant demand change, and there‚Äôll be rippling effects throughout every other segment of the economy downstream and upstream of such a thing. So it‚Äôs kind of common sense, but most economics, most classical economics, it‚Äôs always taught with fairly simplistic linear models. And oftentimes even ‚Äî I‚Äôm really shocked today that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scalar arithmetic. For example, if you read any article in New York Times or the Wall Street Journal they just refer to an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation rate is x, and if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation, generally they‚Äôre all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI and then they try to extrapolate from that, and you just get nowhere with it. Lex Fridman: So at the very least we should be considering inflation and other economics concepts as a non-linear dynamical system. So non-linearity, and also just embracing the full complexity of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation, maybe have some interesting models around that? Michael Saylor: Wouldn‚Äôt it be refreshing if somebody ‚Äî for once ‚Äî published a table of the change in price of every product, every service, and every asset, in every place over time? Lex Fridman: You said table ‚Äî some of that also is the task of visualization: how to extract from this complex set of numbers patterns that somehow indicate something fundamental about what‚Äôs happening. So like: summarization of data is still important. Perhaps summarization not down to a single scalar value, but looking at that whole sea of numbers, you have to find patterns. Like, what is inflation in a particular sector? What is maybe change over time? Maybe different geographical regions? Things of that nature. I think that‚Äôs kind of ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know even what that task is. You could look at machine learning. You can look at AI with that perspective, which is like, How do you represent what‚Äôs happening as efficiently as possible? That‚Äôs never going to be a single number, but it might be a compressed model that captures something beautiful, something fundamental about what‚Äôs happening. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs an asset? What‚Äôs asset hyperinflation? You mentioned bond market swap rate, and assets is where the all majority of the hyperinflation happened. What‚Äôs inflation? What‚Äôs hyperinflation? What‚Äôs an asset? What‚Äôs an asset market? I‚Äôm going to ask so many dumb questions. Michael Saylor: In the conventional economic world you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price of a market basket of consumer products defined by a government agency. Lex Fridman: So they have a like traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying the government selects like toilet paper, food, toaster, refrigerator, electronics, all that kind of stuff? And it‚Äôs like a representative basket of goods that lead to a content existence on this Earth for a regular consumer? Michael Saylor: They define a synthetic metric, right? I mean, I‚Äôm going to say you should have a thousand square foot apartment and you should have a used car and you should eat three hamburgers a week. Now ten years go by and the apartment costs more ‚Äî I could adjust the market basket. They call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that it used to be in 1978 you had a thousand square feet but in the year 2020 you only need 700 square feet because we‚Äôve many miniaturized televisions and we‚Äôve got more efficient electric appliances and because things have collapsed into the iPhone and you just don‚Äôt need as much space. So now it may be that the apartment costs 50% more but after the hedonic adjustment there is no inflation because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have. Lex Fridman: So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power? Michael Saylor: Pretty much. I guess my criticism of the economist is: rather than embracing inflation based upon its fundamental idea which is the rate at which the price of things go up, they‚Äôve been captured by mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the government issued CPI or government-issued PCE or government-issued PPI measure, which was never the rate at which things go up, it‚Äôs simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and services the government wishes to track go up. Now the problem with that is two big things: one thing is the government gets to create the market basket and so they keep changing what‚Äôs in the basket over time. So if I said three years ago you should go see ten concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost two hundred dollars each now it‚Äôs two thousand dollars a year to go see concerts now. I‚Äôm in charge of calculating inflation, so i redefine your entertainment quota for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts and now they don‚Äôt cost two thousand dollars, they cost nothing and there is no inflation, but you don‚Äôt get your concerts, right? So the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket. But in my opinion that‚Äôs not the biggest problem. The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren‚Äôt products or services. Assets can‚Äôt be inflated. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs an asset? Michael Saylor: A house. A share of Apple stock. A bond. A Bitcoin is an asset. Or a Picasso painting. Lex Fridman: So not a consumable good, not an apple that you can eat Michael Saylor: Right. If I throw away an asset then I‚Äôm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it. So what happens if I change the policy such that ‚Äî let‚Äôs take the classic example: a million dollar bond at a five percent interest rate gives you fifty thousand dollars a year in risk-free income. you might retire on fifty thousand dollars a year in a low-cost jurisdiction. So the cost of social security or early retirement is one million dollars when the interest rate is five percent. During the crisis of march of 2020 the interest rate went on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points. Okay so now the cost of that bond is 10 million dollars. the cost of social security went from a million dollars to 10 million dollars. So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money, and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after on a $50,000 salary living on a beach in Mexico wherever you wanted to go, you had hyperinflation. The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of some amount of time. In fact, in that case that was like over the course of about 12 years. As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up, but the conventional view is: Oh that‚Äôs not a problem because it‚Äôs good that assets, the bond is highly priced because we own the bond. Or, what‚Äôs the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19%? It‚Äôs an awful problem for a 22-year old that‚Äôs starting their first job that‚Äôs saving money to buy a house, but it would be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say, Well, asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation and now the economy‚Äôs got more wealth. And so that‚Äôs viewed as a benefit. Lex Fridman: So what‚Äôs being missed here? Like, the suffering of the average person? Or the struggle, the suffering, the pain of the average person, like metrics that [don‚Äôt] capture that within the economic system? Michael Saylor: One way to say it is: a conventional view of inflation as CPI understates the human misery that‚Äôs in inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies by the political class. And so it‚Äôs a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the property class. It‚Äôs a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed or the controlled market. It‚Äôs a massive shift of power from the people to the government. and maybe one more illustrative point here, Lex is: what do you think the inflation rate‚Äôs been for the past 100 years? Lex Fridman: Are you talking about the scalar again? Michael Saylor: If you took a survey of everybody on the street and you asked them what do they think inflation was? What is it? Remember when Jerome Powell said our target‚Äôs two percent but we‚Äôre not there? If you go around the corner I have posted the deed to this house, sold in 1930. And the number on that deed is one hundred thousand dollars in 1930. And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z-estimate ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Is it higher than that? Lex Fridman: As measured by GDP? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd go that far yet, but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff and if you ask the question how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year than this year? Or what‚Äôs the value of all of our innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months? You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to say we get 2% better. a typical investor thinks they‚Äôre 10% better every year. So if you look at what‚Äôs going on, really when you‚Äôre holding a million dollars of stocks and you‚Äôre getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply ‚Äî you‚Äôre getting a 2%-3% [real] gain under best circumstances. and another way to say that is: if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10% ‚Äî it probably should be. Now that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions like: if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands at 7%-10% a year and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest, is that fair? and who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment where you‚Äôre just inflating the money supply and you‚Äôre holding the assets constant, it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply. And the difference in asset appreciation is going to be a function of the scarce desirable quality of the assets and to what extent can I make more of them and to what extent are they are they truly limited in supply? Lex Fridman: Yeah so we‚Äôll get to a lot of the words you said there: the scarcity and that‚Äôs connected to how limited they are, and the value of those assets. But you also said: so the expansion of the money supply ‚Äî you just put another way, is printing money ‚Äî and so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply? Just to put some terms on the table so we understand them: you nonchalantly say it‚Äôs always the on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding every year by 7%. That‚Äôs a bad thing? That‚Äôs a universally bad thing? Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs the word, adiabatic? Michael Saylor: Adiabatic lapse. In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with the phrase, Assume an adiabatic system. And what that means is a closed system. So I‚Äôve got a container and in that container no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters, so it‚Äôs a closed system. Lex Fridman: So you‚Äôve got a closed system lapse. There‚Äôs a leak in the ship. Michael Saylor: Okay, I‚Äôm going to use a physical metaphor for you because you‚Äôre into jujitsu. Like, you‚Äôve got 10 pints of blood in your body? And so before your next workout I‚Äôm going to take one pint from you. Now you‚Äôre going to go exercise but you‚Äôve lost 10% of your blood. Okay? You‚Äôre not going to perform as well ‚Äî it takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets. So what if I tell you every month you‚Äôve got to show up and I‚Äôm going to bleed you? So if I‚Äôm draining the energy, I‚Äôm draining the blood from your body, you can‚Äôt perform. Adiabatic lapse is: when you go up in altitude, every thousand feet, you lose three degrees. You go up 50,000 feet you‚Äôre 150 degrees colder than sea level. that‚Äôs why you look at your instruments and instead of 80 degrees your -70 degrees. Why is the temperature falling? Temperatures falling because it‚Äôs not a closed system, it‚Äôs an open system. as the air expands, the density falls. The energy per cubic whatever falls and therefore the temperature falls, right? The heat‚Äôs falling out of the solution. so when you‚Äôre inflating ‚Äî let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre inflating the currency supply by 6% ‚Äî you‚Äôre sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is using to function. Lex Fridman: So this ocean of currency, for the economy to function ‚Äî it‚Äôs being inefficient when you expand the money supply? It‚Äôs how you do transactions at a scale of billions? Lex Fridman: Selling houses and buying houses is much more inefficient. Or like, you can‚Äôt transact between billions of people with houses. Michael Saylor: Yeah, properties don‚Äôt make such good mediums of exchange. they make better stores of value, and they they have utility value if it‚Äôs a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn. Lex Fridman: Can I zoom out? Can we keep zooming out until we reach the origin of human civilization but on the way ask: you gave economists a D-. I‚Äôm not even going to ask you what you give to governments. Do you think their failure ‚Äî economist and government failure ‚Äî is malevolence? Or incompetence? Michael Saylor: I think policymakers are well-intentioned but generally all government policy is inflammatory and inflationary. So what I mean by that is: when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy, if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy, a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy, medical policy ‚Äî every one of these policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational actor from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way. So when you layer them on top of each other, they all have to be paid for. if you want to shut down the entire economy for a year, you have to pay for it. If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it. If you don‚Äôt want to use oil or natural gas, you have to pay for it. If you don‚Äôt want to manufacture semiconductors in China and you want to manufacture them in the US, you got to pay for it. If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of employees and then I unionize the employees, then not only do I idle the factory in the Far East ‚Äî it goes to 50% capacity, so whatever it sells it has to raise the price on ‚Äî and then I drive up the cost of labor for every other manufacturer in the US because I‚Äôm competing against them. I‚Äôm changing their conditions. So everything gets less efficient, everything gets more expensive. and of course the government couldn‚Äôt really pay for its policies and its wars with taxes. We didn‚Äôt pay for World War I with tax, we didn‚Äôt pay for World War II with tax, we didn‚Äôt pay for Vietnam with tax. In fact, when you trace this, what you realize is: the government never pays for all of its policies with taxes. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs too painful to raise the taxes to truly transparently pay for the things you‚Äôre doing with taxpayer money. Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs one interpretation. or, it‚Äôs just too transparent. Like, if people understood the true cost Lex Fridman: Of war, they wouldn‚Äôt want to go to war. Michael Saylor: If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets and 90% of everything, ever, will be taken from you, you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy and you might not vote for that politician. Lex Fridman: But you‚Äôre still saying incompetence, not malevolence. so fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy of incompetence, is kind of how you look at it? Michael Saylor: I think a lack of humility, right? Like, if people had more humility then they would realize. Lex Fridman: Humility about how little they know, how little they understand about the function of complex systems. Michael Saylor: There‚Äôs the phrase from Clint Eastwood‚Äôs movie Unforgiven where he says, A man‚Äôs gotta know his limitations. I think that a lot of people overestimate what they can accomplish, and experience in life causes you to reevaluate that. So I mean, I‚Äôve done a lot of things in my life, and generally my mistakes were always my good ideas that I enthusiastically pursued to the detriment of my great ideas that required 150% of my attention to prosper. So I think people pursue too many good ideas. you know, they all sound good, but there‚Äôs just a limit to what you can accomplish, and everybody underestimates the challenges of implementing an idea, and they always overestimate the benefits of the pursuit of that. So I think it‚Äôs an overconfidence that causes an overexuberance in pursuit of policies. and as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply. I could say the money supply, but let‚Äôs say the currency supply: you can triple the number of pesos in the economy but it doesn‚Äôt triple the amount of manufacturing capacity in the said economy, and it doesn‚Äôt triple the amount of assets in the economy. It just triples the pesos. So as you increase the currency supply, then the price of all those scarce desirable things will tend to go up rapidly, and the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations, the individual actors, and trading partners will collapse. Lex Fridman: If we take a tangent on a tangent ‚Äî and we will return soon to the big human civilization question ‚Äî so if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can‚Äôt afford, what‚Äôs the best form of government? Anarchism? Libertarianism? So there‚Äôs not even armies, there‚Äôs no borders ‚Äî that‚Äôs anarchism. The smallest possible? Michael Saylor: The best government would be the least, and the debate will be over that. Lex Fridman: When you think about this stuff, do you think about, Okay, government is the way it is, I, as a person that can generate great ideas ‚Äî how do I operate in this world? Or do you also think about the big picture, if we start a new civilization somewhere on mars? Do you think about what‚Äôs the ultimate form of government? At least, what‚Äôs a promising thing to try. Michael Saylor: You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter. Lex Fridman: Yes, what does that mean? Michael Saylor: The significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference. and if I look at the civilization, I would say half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective ‚Äî half, 50%. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs $500 trillion dollars worth of problems? Like, money represents all the economic energy in the civilization, and it kind of equates to all the products, all the services, and all the assets that we have and we‚Äôre ever gonna have ‚Äî so that‚Äôs half. The other half of the problems in the civilization are medical and military and political and philosophical and natural. And I think that there are a lot of different solutions to all those problems, and they are all honorable professions and they all merit a lifetime of consideration for the specialist in all those areas. I think that what I could offer that‚Äôs constructive is: inflation is completely misunderstood. It‚Äôs a much bigger problem than we understand it to be. We need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further the human condition. All government policy is inflationary. And another pernicious myth is: inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. So a famous quote by Milton Friedman I believe it‚Äôs like, It‚Äôs a monetary phenomenon. that is, inflation comes from expanding the currency supply. It‚Äôs a nice phrase and it‚Äôs oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation, but again it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is. If I had a currency which was completely non-inflationary, if I never printed another dollar and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the Earth, we‚Äôd still have inflation. We‚Äôd have inflation as long as we have government that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in themselves inflationary, and generally they all are. Michael Saylor: Hiding the cost is like the tertiary thing. The primary goal is: the government will attempt to do good, right? Lex Fridman: And that‚Äôs the primary problem? Michael Saylor: They will attempt to do good and they will and they will do good imperfectly and they will create oftentimes more damage than the good they do. Most government policy will be iatrogenic: it will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it ‚Äî but it is what it is. The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it by expanding the currency supply without realizing that they‚Äôre actually paying for it in a sub-optimal fashion: they‚Äôll collapse their own currencies while they attempt to do good. The tertiary issue is: they will mismeasure how badly they‚Äôre collapsing the currency. so for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and look at the numbers printed by the Fed, they‚Äôll say, Oh it looks like the dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power over 100 years. Okay, they sort of fess up that there‚Äôs a problem, but they make it a 95% loss over 100 years ‚Äî what they don‚Äôt do is realize it‚Äôs a 99.7% loss over 80 years, so they will mismeasure just the horrific extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy and the domestic policy, which they overestimate their budget and their means to accomplish their ends and they underestimate the cost and they‚Äôre oblivious to the horrific damage that they do to the civilization, because the mental models that they use ‚Äî that are conventionally taught ‚Äî are wrong. The mental model that like, It‚Äôs okay, we can print all this money because the velocity of the money is low, right? ‚Äî because money velocity is a scalar and inflation is a scalar and we don‚Äôt see 2% inflation yet and the money velocity is low and so it‚Äôs okay if we print trillions of dollars. Well, the money velocity was immediate. The velocity of money through the crypto economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity of money through the consumer economy. I think Nic [Carter] pointed out when you spoke to him, he said it takes two months for a credit card transaction to settle. So you want to spend a million dollars in the consumer economy, you can move it six times a year. You put a million dollars into gold? Gold will sit in a vault for a decade, so the velocity of money through gold is 0.1. You put the money in the stock market and you can trade it once a week, the settlement is T+2. maybe you get the 2:1 leverage, you might get to a money velocity of 100 a year in the stock market. You put your money into the crypto economy and these people are settling every four hours, and if you‚Äôre offshore they‚Äôre trading with 20x leverage. So if you settle every day and you trade the 20x leverage you just went to 7,000! So the velocity of the money varies. I think the politicians, they don‚Äôt really understand inflation and they don‚Äôt understand economics, but you can‚Äôt blame them because the economists don‚Äôt understand economics. Because if they did, they would be creating multi-variate computer simulations where they actually put in the price of every piece of housing in every city in the world, the full array of foods, the full array of products, the full array of assets, and then on a monthly basis they would publish all those results. That‚Äôs a high bandwidth requirement and I think that people don‚Äôt really want to embrace it. And also there‚Äôs the most pernicious thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs that phrase, You can‚Äôt tell people what to think but you can tell them what to think about ‚Äî the most pernicious thing is: I get you to misunderstand the phenomenon so that even when it‚Äôs happening to you, you don‚Äôt appreciate that it‚Äôs a bad thing and you think it‚Äôs a good thing. So if housing prices are going up 20% year-over-year and I say, This is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners, then I‚Äôve misrepresented a phenomenon. Inflation is 20%, not 7%, and then I‚Äôve misrepresented it as being a positive rather than a negative. And the people will stare at it and you could even show them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it‚Äôs warming them up and they‚Äôre going to save on their heat costs. Michael Saylor: I mean honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street and you asked them to define inflation, how many would say it‚Äôs a vector tracking the change in price of every product, service, asset in the world over time? Not many. If you went to them and you said, Do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad? The majority would probably say, Well here, it‚Äôs good. The majority of economists would say, 2% inflation a year is good. Look at the ship next to us: what if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its volume every something, right? The ship is rotting 2% a year ‚Äî that means the useful life of the ship is 50 years. Now ironically, that‚Äôs true: a wooden ship had a 50‚Äì100 year life. 100 would be long, 50 years is not unlikely. So when we built ships out of wood, they had a useful life of about 50 years and then they sunk and they rotted. There‚Äôs nothing good about it, right? You build a ship out of steel and it‚Äôs 0% as opposed to 2% degradation, and how much better is 0% versus 2%? well 2% means you have a useful half-life of 35 years. That‚Äôs basically the half-life of money in gold. If I store your life force in gold ‚Äî under perfect circumstances ‚Äî you have a useful life at 35 years. 0% is a useful life of forever. so 0% is immortal, 2% is 35 years average life expectancy. So the idea that you would think the life expectancy of the currency in the civilization should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion, but the tragic notion is since the 1970‚Äôs it‚Äôs been 10 years. Money has had a half-life of 10 years, except for the fact that in weak societies ‚Äî in Argentina or the like ‚Äî the half-life of the money is 3‚Äì4 years, in Venezuela 1 year. So the United States dollar and the United States economic system was the most successful economic system in the world in the last hundred years: we won every war, we were the world superpower. Our currency lost 99.7% of its value. And that means ‚Äî horrifically ‚Äî every other currency lost everything. In essence, the other ones were 99.9% except for most that were 100% because they all completely failed, and you‚Äôve got a you‚Äôve got a mainstream economic community that thinks that inflation is a number and 2% is desirable. It‚Äôs kind of like: remember George Washington, you know how he died? Lex Fridman: No Lex Fridman: But that‚Äôs both the bug and the feature of human civilization, that ideas take hold, they unite us, we believe in them, and we make a lot of cool stuff happen ‚Äî just the fact of the matter: a lot of people believe the same thing, they get together, and they get some shit done because they believe that thing. And then some ideas can be really bad and really destructive, but on average the ideas seem to be progressing in a direction of good. Let me just step back: what the hell are we doing here ‚Äî us humans on this Earth? How do you think of humans? How special are humans? How did human civilization originate on this Earth? And what is this human project that we‚Äôre all taking on? You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea ‚Äî always thought you can get the demons out in that way, but that was a recent invention. So what‚Äôs this thing we‚Äôre doing here? Michael Saylor: I think what distinguishes human beings from all the other creatures on the Earth is our ability to engineer. We‚Äôre engineers, right? Lex Fridman: To solve problems? Or just to build incredible cool things? Michael Saylor: Engineering: harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it. From the point that we actually started to play with fire, that was a big leap forward. Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another another step forward. Every city built on water ‚Äî why water? Well, water‚Äôs bringing energy. If you actually put a turbine on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you‚Äôve literally harnessed gravitational energy. But water is also bringing you food, it‚Äôs also giving you a cheap form of getting rid of your waste, it‚Äôs also giving you free transportation ‚Äî you want to move 1-ton blocks around? You want to move them in water. So the human story is really the story of engineering a better world. And the rise in the human condition is determined by those groups of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy. If you look, the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and water and created a trading network. The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of engineering ‚Äî the aqueducts are a great example. If you go to any big city, you travel through cities in the Med, you find that the carrying capacity of the city or the island is 5,000 people without running water, and then if you can find a way to bring water to it, it increases by a factor of 10. And so human flourishing is really only possible through that channeling of energy. That eventually takes the form of air power. that ship ‚Äî look at the intricacy of those sails. I mean just the model is intricate ‚Äî now think about all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put on that ship and how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them. Lex Fridman: Yes, there‚Äôs thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details, all to increase the effectiveness the efficiency of this ship as it sails through water. And we should also note there‚Äôs a bunch of cannons on the side. Michael Saylor: Another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives. Lex Fridman: To achieve what end? That‚Äôs another discussion. Michael Saylor: I suppose we‚Äôre trying to get off the planet, right? Lex Fridman: Well there‚Äôs a selection mechanism going on, so natural selection. However evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on Earth was the predator-prey dynamic, that you want to be the bigger fish. that violence seems to serve a useful purpose if you look at Earth as a whole. Humans now like to think of violence as really a bad thing. It seems to be one of the amazing things about humans is we ultimately tend towards cooperation: we like peace. If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm, but just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering and destruction and so on. And they have a resetting the palate effect. It‚Äôs one that‚Äôs full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it‚Äôs like a way to start over. Lex Fridman: By number of organisms? Michael Saylor: By count. And the answer that came back was human beings! I was shocked ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Apparently if we‚Äôre just looking at mammals, the answer was: human beings are the most common, which was very interesting to me. I almost didn‚Äôt believe it, but I was trying to think: 8 billion or so human beings ‚Äî there‚Äôs no other mammal that‚Äôs got more than 8 billion? If you walk through downtown Edinburgh in Scotland and you look up on this hill, there‚Äôs this castle up on the hill and you talk to people and the story is, Oh yeah well that was a British castle, before it was a Scottish castle, before it was Pict castle, before it was a Roman castle, before it was some other Celtic castle. Then they found 13 prehistoric castles buried one under the other, under the other, and you get to the conclusion that 100,000 years ago somebody showed up and grabbed the high-point ‚Äî the apex of the city ‚Äî and they built a stronghold there and they flourished and their family flourished and their tribe flourished until someone came along and knocked him off the hill. And it‚Äôs been a non-stop, never-ending fight by the aggressive, most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever ‚Äî Lex Fridman: All for the hill. Michael Saylor: For that one hill, going back since time immemorial, and you scratch your head and you think, It seems like it‚Äôs just this never-ending wheel. Lex Fridman: But doesn‚Äôt that leave all kinds of metrics? That seems to improve the quality of our cannons and ships as a result. Like, it seems that war ‚Äî just like your laser eyes ‚Äî focuses the mind on the engineering tasks. Michael Saylor: It is that, and it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful. And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means. Like, Who‚Äôs the most powerful? Or, The most powerful side won, but they don‚Äôt think about power as energy delivered in a period of time, and then you think, A guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist, and someone with a bow and arrow is more powerful than the person with the spear, and then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful than without, and steel is more powerful than bronze. And if you look at the Romans, they persevered with artillery and they could stand off from 800 meters and blast you to smithereens. You study the history of the Balearic slingers and you think we invented bullets, but they invented bullets to put in slings thousands of years ago. They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head, right? And so there was never a time when when humanity wasn‚Äôt vying to come up with an asymmetric form of projecting their own power via technology. Lex Fridman: An absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans. They‚Äôre facing the same direction ‚Äî working in the same direction to leverage energy. Michael Saylor: The most organized society wins. When the Romans were were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization in Europe. And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated. And at some point they over-expanded and got disorganized and they collapsed. And I guess you could say that the struggle of the human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies one after the other, it penalizes ‚Äî anybody that rejects ocean power gets penalized. You reject artillery, you get penalized. You reject atomic power, you get penalized. If you reject digital power, cyber power, you get penalized, and the underlying control of the property keeps shifting hands from one institution or one government to another, based upon how rationally they‚Äôre able to channel that energy and how well organized or coordinated they are. Lex Fridman: Well that‚Äôs really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments and companies ‚Äî once they get a few good ideas they seem to stick with them. They reject new ideas. Whether that‚Äôs emergent or however that evolved, it seems to have a really interesting effect because when you‚Äôre young you fight for the new ideas, you push them through, then a few of us humans find success, then we get complacent, we take over the world using that new idea, and then the new young person with the better new idea challenges you and you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old and lose because of it. And that‚Äôs how empires collapse. And it‚Äôs just both at the individual level that happens, when two academics fighting about ideas or something like that, and at the human civilization-level ‚Äî governments, they hold on to the ideas of old. it‚Äôs fascinating. Michael Saylor: Yeah an ever-persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift, and the paradigms shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives. Or, the paradigm shifts when there‚Äôs a war and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping on their head. Or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is has a rude awakening. And if they totally disagree, their society collapses and they‚Äôre replaced by that new thing. Michael Saylor: I think there‚Äôs two big ideas: the first wave of ideas were digital information, and that was the Internet wave that‚Äôs been running since 1990 or so, for 30 years. And the second wave is digital energy. So if I look at digital information, this idea that we want to digitally transform a book, I‚Äôm going to dematerialize every book in this room into bits and then I‚Äôm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people and I‚Äôm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity ‚Äî if I can dematerialize music, books, education, entertainment, maps, that is an incredibly exothermic transaction. it‚Äôs a crystallization. When we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization we give off massive amounts of energy. Like, if you look at what Carnegie did: the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time and he gave away his entire fortune. And now we can give a better library to every six year old for nothing. And so what‚Äôs the value of giving a million books to 8 billion people? That‚Äôs the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation. And when we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car, you get in the car, and the car drives you where you want to go with the map. And how much better is that than a Rand McNally atlas right here? It‚Äôs like a million times better. So the first wave of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are non-conservative ‚Äî that is, I could take Beethoven‚Äôs 5th symphony played by the best orchestra in Germany and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at less than the cost of the one performance. So I deliver culture and education and erudition and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails, and the consequences to the human race are, first order, generally good, right? The world is a better place, it drives growth, and you create these trillion-dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft. That is the first wave. Lex Fridman: That first wave, it feels like the impact that‚Äôs positive ‚Äî you said the first order impact is generally positive ‚Äî it feels like it‚Äôs positive in a way that nothing else in history has been positive. And then we may not actually truly be able to understand the orders of magnitude of increase in productivity, in just progress of human civilization, until we look back centuries from now. Like just looking at the impact of Wikipedia, giving access to basic knowledge and then perhaps wisdom to billions of people ‚Äî if you can just linger on that for a second: what‚Äôs your sense of the impact of that? Lex Fridman: There are certain problems like education that could be solved through this process of dematerialization. And by the way, to give props to the 500,000 algebra teachers ‚Äî when I look at YouTube, for example, one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers probably had days and moments of brilliance, and if they had ability to contribute to ‚Äî in the natural selection process ‚Äî like the market of education where the best ones rise up. That‚Äôs a really interesting way, which is like: the best day of your life, the best lesson you‚Äôve ever taught, could be found and broadcast to billions of people. So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world. Now traveling across planets, you still can‚Äôt solve that problem with dematerialization. What you could solve, potentially, is dematerializing the human brain, where you can transfer ‚Äî like you don‚Äôt need to have astronauts on the ship you ‚Äî can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain. Michael Saylor: Touching on those points: you‚Äôd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers to become 500,000 math specialists and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams and they all pursue 50,000 new problems and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot. That‚Äôs the same as when I give you 11 cents worth of electricity and you don‚Äôt have to row a boat eight hours a day before you can eat. It would be a lot better that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your day and then you could start thinking about other things, right? With regard to technology, one thing that I learned studying technology ‚Äî when you look at S-curves ‚Äî is: until you start the S-curve, you don‚Äôt know whether you‚Äôre 100 years from viability, 1,000 years from viability, or a few months from viability. Lex Fridman: Isn‚Äôt that fun? That‚Äôs so fun ‚Äî the early part of the S-curve is so fun because you don‚Äôt know. Michael Saylor: In 1900 you could have got any number of learned academics to give you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly. And in 1903 the Wright Brothers flew, and by 1969 we‚Äôre walking on the moon. So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary, but for the 100 years and 200 years before they were just back and forth and nobody was close. And that‚Äôs the happy part. The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever to 25,000 flying miles an hour in 66 years. The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical engineering at MIT in the 80's and in the 80's we had Gulfstream aircraft, we had Boeing 737s, we had the space shuttle, and you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact aircraft ‚Äî the efficiency of the engines was 20%-30% more. We slammed into a brick wall around ‚Äò69-‚Äô75. In fact the Global Express, the Gulfstream ‚Äî these were all engineered in the 70's, some in the 60's. The actual fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 is the same shape as a G4 is the same shape as a G3 is the same shape as a G2, and that‚Äôs because they were afraid to change the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel and they knew it worked, and when they finally decided to change the shape it was like a $10 billion dollar exercise with modern supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics. Lex Fridman: Why was it so hard? What was that wall made of that they slammed into? Michael Saylor: But the right question is: so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree spend his career in software? Like, why is it that I never a day in my life ‚Äî with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work ‚Äî I never got paid to be an aeronautical engineer and I worked in software engineering my entire career. Lex Fridman: Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical engineering in some way. Like maybe you hit fundamental walls until you have to return to it centuries later? Or no? Michael Saylor: The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man, Andrew Mellon, and you know how he made his money? Aluminum. And you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum? Nothing. Lex Fridman: So it‚Äôs a materials problem? Michael Saylor: Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy. I mean that was US Steel, that was iron to steel, aluminum ‚Äî massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical advance. And then we also had the internal combustion engine and the story of Ford and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that. So you have no jet engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation, but even if you had those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel ‚Äî no chance ‚Äî you had to have aluminum. So there‚Äôs like two pretty basic technologies, and once you have those two technologies, stuff happens very fast. So tell me the last big advance in jet engines? There hasn‚Äôt been one. The last big advance in rocket engines? There hasn‚Äôt been one. The big advances in spaceship design, from what I can see, are in the control systems, the gyros, and the ability to land in a stable fashion ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty amazing landing a rocket. Lex Fridman: Also, at least according to Elon and so on, the manufacturer ‚Äî the more efficient and less expensive manufacturer of rockets. So like production ‚Äî whatever that you call that discipline of at-scale manufacture or at-scale production, so factory work. But it‚Äôs not 10x. I mean, maybe it‚Äôs 10x over a period of a few decades. Lex Fridman: But it could have been ‚Äî at the beginning of the S-curve. Michael Saylor: But fundamentally, we didn‚Äôt really have an effective mechanism ‚Äî I mean, people getting vertigo and they‚Äôre ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Yeah, but you didn‚Äôt know that at the beginning of the S-curve, right? I mean maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality, but you don‚Äôt know that. You‚Äôre looking through the fog ‚Äî you don‚Äôt know. Michael Saylor: So the point is: we‚Äôre year zero in 2013 and we‚Äôre still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality, and when somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo, without any disorientation, that managed to have the stability and the bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world ‚Äî you‚Äôll be in year one. And from that point, you‚Äôll have a 70-year or some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth, and then it‚Äôll slow down. And this is the story of a lot of things. I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business in the 1860's and the oil business as we understood it became fairly mature by the 1920's to 1930's, and then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like 70 years later and then it burst forward. Lex Fridman: The interesting story about Moore‚Äôs law, though, is that you get this constant burst of S-curves on top of S-curves on top of S-curves ‚Äî it‚Äôs like, the moment you start slowing down, or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another innovation, another innovation. It‚Äôs like, Moore‚Äôs law doesn‚Äôt seem to happen in every technological advancement. It seems like you only get a couple of S-curves and then you‚Äôre done for a bit, so I wonder what pressures there are that resulted in such success over several decades, and still going. Michael Saylor: Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S-curve kicks off, and you could be 20 years early or 100 years early. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, they were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago. So humility says you‚Äôre not quite sure when you really hit that commercial viability, and it also dictates: you don‚Äôt know when it ends. Like, when will the party stop? When will Moore‚Äôs law stop, and we‚Äôll get to the point where they are exponentially diminishing returns on silicon performance? Just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet engines, and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% percent better. But while you‚Äôre in the middle of it, then you know you can do things. So the reason that the digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms ‚Äî the bandwidth of and the performance of the components, and the components are the radio protocols, mobile protocols, the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays ‚Äî those four components are pretty critical. They‚Äôre all critical in the creation of an iPhone ‚Äî I wrote about it in the book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution. Because they have advanced and continued to advance, they created a very fertile environment for all these digital transformations. And the digital transformations themself, they call for creativity on their own. Like, I think the interesting thing about ‚Äî let‚Äôs take digital maps ‚Äî when you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, it becomes a map because I can put it on a display like an iPad or I can put it in a car like a Tesla, but if you really want to figure it out, you can‚Äôt think like an engineer. You need to think like a fantasy writer. Like, this is where it‚Äôs useful if you played Dungeons & Dragons and you read Lord of the Rings and you study all the fantasy literature, because when I dematerialize the map, first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map ‚Äî that‚Äôs a simple physical transform. But then I start to put telemetry into the map and I keep track of the traffic rates on the roads and I tell you whether you‚Äôll be in a traffic jam if you drive that way and I tell you which way to drive, and then I start to get feedback on where you‚Äôre going and I tell you the restaurant‚Äôs closed and people don‚Äôt like it anyway, and then I put an AI on top of it and I have it drive your car for you. And eventually, the implication of digital transformation of maps is: I get in a self-driving car and I say, Take me someplace cool where I can eat? [goes to sleep]. And how did you get to that last step? It wasn‚Äôt simple engineering. There‚Äôs a bit of fantasy in there. A bit of magic. Lex Fridman: Design, art, whatever the heck you call it. Yeah, fantasy injects magic into the engineering process. Like, imagination precedes great revolutions in engineering. It‚Äôs like imagining a world of what you can do with the display, how will the interaction be. That‚Äôs where Google Glass actually came in: augmented reality, virtual reality ‚Äî people are playing in the space of sci-fi imagination. Michael Saylor: They called it a moon shot. They tried ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt work, but to their credit they stopped trying. Michael Saylor: But what I would say is: if half the civilization dropped what they were doing tomorrow and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri ‚Äî it might not be the best use of our resources, because it‚Äôs kind of like if half of Athens in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines. If you went back and you said, What advice would you give them? Lex Fridman: Don‚Äôt! Michael Saylor: You would say, It‚Äôs not going to work until you get to aluminum, and you‚Äôre not going to get to aluminum untill you work out the steel and certain other things, and you‚Äôre not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some metallurgy ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a dude, Newton, that won‚Äôt come along for quite a while and he‚Äôs going to give you the calculus to do it and until then it‚Äôs hopeless. So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon sails or something. So if I look at this today I would say: There‚Äôs massive profound civilizational advances to be made through digital transformation of information ‚Äî and you can see them. This is not the story of today, right? It‚Äôs 10 years old, what we‚Äôve been seeing. Lex Fridman: We‚Äôre living through different manifestations of that story today too, though. Like, social media, the effects of that is very interesting, because ideas spread even ‚Äî you talk about velocity of money ‚Äî the velocity of ideas keeps increasing. So like Wikipedia is a passive store of knowledge. Twitter is like a water hose or something ‚Äî it‚Äôs like spraying you with knowledge whether you want it or not. Social media is just like this explosion of ideas and then we pick them up and then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche, so sometimes there‚Äôs more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take hold, so we get to learn about ourselves, we get to learn about the technology that can decelerate the propaganda, for example ‚Äî all that kind of stuff. But the reality is I feel like we‚Äôre living through a singularity in the digital information space, and we don‚Äôt have a great understanding of exactly how it‚Äôs transforming our lives. Michael Saylor: This is where money is useful as a metaphor for significance, because if money is the economic energy of the civilization, then something that‚Äôs extraordinarily lucrative that‚Äôs going to generate a monetary or a wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization. And ultimately, if we had 10x as much of everything we‚Äôd have a lot more free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical endeavors. So let‚Äôs take Twitter, right? Twitter‚Äôs something that could be 10x more valuable than it is. Twitter could be made 10x better. Lex Fridman: Oh by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your Twitter account is awesome. Michael Saylor: Thank you. Yeah Twitter can be made 10x better. If we take YouTube or take education, we could generate a billion PhDs. And the question is: do you need any profound breakthrough in materials or technology to do that? And the answer is: Not really. So you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter ‚Äî all these things ‚Äî better. The US Government, if they took 1% of the money they spend on the department of education and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to people that actually met those requirements, they could provide 100x as much education for 1/100th of the cost and they could do it with no new technology ‚Äî that‚Äôs a marketing and political challenge. So I don‚Äôt think every objective is equally practical, and I think the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements, is: when the government pursues an impractical objective, or when anybody ‚Äî not so bad with an entrepreneur because they don‚Äôt have that much money to waste ‚Äî when a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions of dollars and achieve nothing. Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives, then I think you can have profound impact on the human civilization. And if I look at the world we‚Äôre in today, I think that there are multi-trillion ‚Äî $10, $20, $50 trillion dollars ‚Äî worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be obtained, but there‚Äôs hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm that, not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don‚Äôt even know what digital energy is. Most of them would reject the concept. They‚Äôre not looking for it. They‚Äôre not expecting to find it. It‚Äôs inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift, but in fact it‚Äôs completely practical, right under our nose, it‚Äôs staring at us, and it could make the entire civilization work dramatically better in every respect. Michael Saylor: So I‚Äôll start with Tesla: he had a very famous quote. He said, If you want to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency. And it gets you thinking about, What is the universe? And of course the universe is just all energy. And then what is matter? Matter is low frequency energy. And what are we? We‚Äôre vibrating from ‚Äî ashes to ashes dust to dust ‚Äî I can turn a tree into light, I can turn light back into a tree. If I consider the entire universe ‚Äî and it‚Äôs very important because we don‚Äôt really think this way ‚Äî let‚Äôs take the New York disco model: if I walk into a nightclub and there‚Äôs loud music blaring in New York City, what‚Äôs really going on there? If you blast out 14 billion years ago, the universe is formed ‚Äî okay, that‚Äôs a low frequency thing ‚Äî the universe. Four and a half billion years ago, the Sun, maybe the Earth, are formed. The continents are 400 million years old. The schist that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years, but the Hudson River is only 20,000 years. There‚Äôs a building that‚Äôs probably 50 years old. There‚Äôs a company operating that disco or that club which is 5‚Äì10 years old. There‚Äôs a person, a customer, walking in there for an experience for a few hours. There‚Äôs music that‚Äôs oscillating at some kilohertz. And then there‚Äôs light. And you and you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, all layered, all moving through different mediums, and how you perceive the world is a question of: At what frequency do you want to perceive the world? And I think that once you start to think that way, you‚Äôre catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like? And why would I want it? And what is it? So why don‚Äôt we just start right there: What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin. Bitcoin‚Äôs a crypto-asset. It‚Äôs a crypto-asset that has monetary value. Lex Fridman: Can we just linger on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value. What is a digital asset? What is monetary? Why use those terms versus the words of money and currency? Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms? Michael Saylor: I would call it a crypto-asset network. The goal is to create a billion-dollar block of pure energy in cyberspace, one that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light. It‚Äôs the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit. How do I actually launch something into orbit? How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction-free? And the solution is a decentralized proof-of-work network. Satoshi‚Äôs solution was: I‚Äôm going to establish a protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by a hundred million satoshis each, transferable via transferring private keys. Now, the innovation is to create that in an ethical, durable fashion. The ethical innovation is: I want it to be property and not a security. A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber, a bar of gold, and a Bitcoin are all property ‚Äî and that means they‚Äôre all commonly occurring elements in the world. You could call them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading ‚Äî and I‚Äôll tell you why in a second ‚Äî but they‚Äôre all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them. If you have a barrel of oil and you‚Äôre in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the US, you have a barrel of oil, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your barrel of oil. They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood. And so, property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe. Lex Fridman: Why use the word ethical? Why ethical, assigned to property? Michael Saylor: Because if it‚Äôs a security ‚Äî a security would be an example of a share of a stock or a crypto token controlled by a small team ‚Äî in the event that something is a security because some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, supply, then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures. So I‚Äôll give you maybe a practical example: I‚Äôm the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech. In my speech I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and a chicken in the backyard, and their own horse, and an automobile ‚Äî that‚Äôs ethical. I give the same speech and I say, I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock, sell their house, or sell their cash, and buy Twitter stock ‚Äî well, is that ethical? Not really. At that point you‚Äôve entered into a conflict of interest, because what you‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôre promoting an asset which is substantially controlled by a small group of people ‚Äî the board of directors or the CEO of the company. So how would you feel if the president of the United States said, I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock. Especially if you worked at Google. But if you worked anywhere, you‚Äôd be like, Why isn‚Äôt he saying, Buy mine? A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape, or form. And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from this ancient idea: Thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal. So if I‚Äôm going to sell you securities or I‚Äôm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else, if I create my own Yo-Yo coin or Mikeycoin and then there‚Äôs a million of them and I tell you that I think that it‚Äôs a really good thing and Mikeycoin will go up forever, everybody buys Mikeycoin and then I give $10 million to you and don‚Äôt tell the public ‚Äî I‚Äôve cheated them. Maybe if I have Mikeycoin and I think there‚Äôs only two million Mikeycoin and I swear to you there‚Äôs only two million and then I get married and I have three kids and my third kid is in the hospital and my kid‚Äôs gonna die and I have this ethical reason to print five hundred thousand more Mikeycoin or else people are gonna die and everybody tells me it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî I‚Äôve still abused the investor, right? It‚Äôs an ethical challenge. If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you‚Äôre a public figure you can‚Äôt endorse a security. You can‚Äôt endorse something that would cause you to have a conflict of interest. So if you‚Äôre a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an influencer, and you want to promote or promulgate or support something using any public influence or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property ‚Äî it can‚Äôt be a security. So it goes beyond that, right? I mean, would the Chinese want to support an American company? As soon as you look at what‚Äôs in the best interest of the human race, the civilization, you realize that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property which is fair. And the way you get to a common property is through an open, permissionless protocol. If It‚Äôs not open ‚Äî if it‚Äôs proprietary and I know what the code says and you don‚Äôt know what the code says ‚Äî that makes it a security. If it‚Äôs permissioned ‚Äî if you‚Äôre not allowed on my network or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security. So when I talk about property ‚Äî I mean, the challenge here is: How do I create something that‚Äôs equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace? And that means it has to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument, open, permissionless, not censorable. If I could do that, then I could deliver you ten thousand dematerialized barrels of oil and you would take settlement of them and you would know that you have possession of that property irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company or anybody else in the world ‚Äî that‚Äôs a really critical characteristic, and it actually is it‚Äôs probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a crypto-asset network ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to create a crypto asset network. It‚Äôs very hard to create an ethical crypto-asset network, because you have to create one without any government or corporation or investor exercising undue influence to make it successful. Michael Saylor: A barrel oil is a bucket of physical liquid property. Bitcoin is a digital property. Lex Fridman: But it‚Äôs easier to confiscate a barrel of oil. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace ‚Äî much easier. Lex Fridman: So that‚Äôs not universally true ‚Äî some things in the digital space are actually easier to confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information, right? Michael Saylor: I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property ‚Äî that the human race possesses or has yet invented ‚Äî to confiscate. And that‚Äôs by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your private key. So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head then that would be the highest form of property right, because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it. It doesn‚Äôt mean I couldn‚Äôt extract it from you under duress, but it means that it‚Äôs harder than every other thing you might own ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs exponentially harder. If you consider every other thing you might own ‚Äî a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights, intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable ‚Äî they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize. So digital property in the form of a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race. In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point: I might say to you Lex, I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure, most durable crypto-asset network in the world, is going to go up forever, and there‚Äôs nothing better in the world. I might be right, I might be wrong, but the point is: because it‚Äôs property, it‚Äôs ethical for me to say that. If I were to turn around and say, You know, Lex, I think the same about Microstrategy stock ‚Äî $MSTR ‚Äî that‚Äôs a security. If I‚Äôm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability, because I could go to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of Microstrategy stock. Whereas, the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the knowledge that I can‚Äôt change it. If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million and I had the button back here, then then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility. Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin and it might not ‚Äî you might go buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not better because you bought Bitcoin, but it wouldn‚Äôt be my ethical liability any more than if I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm. I think you should be a farmer. I think a chicken in every pot. You should get a horse. I think you‚Äôd be better ‚Äî I mean, these are all opinions expressed about property which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with. But in a legal sense, if we read the law ‚Äî if we understand securities law, and I would say most people in the crypto industry, they didn‚Äôt take companies public and so they‚Äôre not really focused on the securities law, they don‚Äôt even know the securities law ‚Äî if you focus on the securities law, that would say: You just can‚Äôt legally sell this stuff to the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by a regulator. So there‚Äôs a fairly bright line there with regard to securities, but when you get to the secondary issue it‚Äôs: How do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures can‚Äôt embrace it or endorse it? You see? So you‚Äôre not going to build a better world based upon Twitter stock, if that‚Äôs your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter stock is never going to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument in Russia or in China ‚Äî it‚Äôs not even legal in China. So it‚Äôs not a global, permissionless, open thing. It will never be trusted by the rest of the world, and legally it‚Äôs impractical. Would you really want to put $100 trillion dollars worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there‚Äôs a board of directors and a CEO that could just get up and take half of it tomorrow? The answer is: No. So if you want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a digital property. And I‚Äôm using property here in a legal sense, but I would also go to the next step and say: property is low frequency money. So if I give you a million dollars and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it. And the house is low frequency money ‚Äî you converted the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house. Maybe after a decade you might convert it back into energy ‚Äî you might sell the house for currency, and it‚Äôll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate. Michael Saylor: How quickly does something vibrate. So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink and then you turn around you buy another, we‚Äôre vibrating on a frequency of every few hours ‚Äî the energy is changing hands. But it‚Äôs not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours, right? The frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every 5 years ‚Äî it‚Äôs a much lower frequency transaction. And so when you think about what‚Äôs going on here, you have extremely low frequency things which we‚Äôll call property, then you have mid frequency things I‚Äôm going to call a money or currency, and then you have high frequency and that‚Äôs energy. And that‚Äôs why I use the illustration of: you got the building, you got the light, and you got the sound, and they‚Äôre all just energy moving at different frequencies. Now, Bitcoin is magical and it‚Äôs truly the innovation ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a singularity, because it represents the first time in the history of the human race that we managed to create a digital property, properly understood. It‚Äôs easy to create something digital, right? Every coupon and every skin on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all these things, they‚Äôre all digital something, but they‚Äôre securities. Shares of stock are securities. When you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you‚Äôre transferring, in essence, a security or an IOU, and so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the Internet domain or in cyberspace ‚Äî that‚Äôs a critical thing ‚Äî and anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that, but what they can‚Äôt do ‚Äî what 99% of them fail to do ‚Äî is be property. They‚Äôre securities. Lex Fridman: Well there‚Äôs a line there I‚Äôd like to explore a little further: for example, what about when Coinbase or something like that, when there‚Äôs an exchange that you buy Bitcoin in, you start to move away from some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this non-censorable and permissionless and open ‚Äî so in order to achieve the convenience, the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove the aspects of property. So I mean, maybe you can comment on that? Michael Saylor: Let me give you a good model for that: if you think about the layer one of Bitcoin, the layer one is the property settlement layer and we‚Äôre going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day, 100 million transactions a year is the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from Point A to Point B with the massive security. The role of the layer one is two things: one thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security. I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on layer one. The second important feature of the layer one is: I need the money to last forever. I need the money indestructible, immortal. So the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo ‚Äî the big trick is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140. And that‚Äôs what we want to solve with layer one. And the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist. What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it been there? Millions of years, it‚Äôs been there. And how fast you want it to move? You don‚Äôt. In fact the single thing that‚Äôs most important is that it not deflect. If it deflects a foot in a hundred years, it‚Äôs too much. If it deflects an inch in a hundred years, you might not want that. So the layer one of Bitcoin is a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it? You could put a trillion, $10 trillion, $100 trillion, a quadrillion. How much weight is on the bedrock in Manhattan, right? Think about 100-story buildings. So the real key there is: the foundational asset needs to be there at all. So the fact that you can create a $100 trillion dollar layer one that would stand for 100 years ‚Äî that is the revolutionary breakthrough ‚Äî first time. And the fact that it‚Äôs ethical and it‚Äôs common property, global, permissionless. Extremely unlikely that would happen ‚Äî people tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after and they‚Äôve all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful, but for the most part. That‚Äôs an extraordinary thing. Michael Saylor: Yeah. So the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber-economy. And we don‚Äôt want it to move fast. What we want is immortal, incorruptible, indestructible. That‚Äôs what you want: integrity from the layer one. Now there‚Äôs layer two and layer three. And layer two I would define as an open, permissionless, non-custodial protocol that uses the underlying layer one token as its gas fee. Lex Fridman: So what‚Äôs custodial mean? And how does the different markets ‚Äî like is Lightning Network? Michael Saylor: So Lightning Network would be an example of a layer two ‚Äî non-custodial. So the Lightning Network will sit on top of layer one ‚Äî it‚Äôll sit on top of Bitcoin ‚Äî and what you want to do is solve the problem of: It‚Äôs well and fine, I don‚Äôt want to move a billion dollars every day, what I want to move is five dollars a billion times a day. So if I want to move five dollars a billion times a day, I don‚Äôt really need to put the entire trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars. All I really need to do is put a hundred thousand dollars in a channel, or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do 10 million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk. And of course it‚Äôs kind of simple: if I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million, I can probably move the stuff a million times faster. And that‚Äôs how Lightning works. It‚Äôs non-custodial because there‚Äôs no corporation or custodian or counterparty you‚Äôre trusting ‚Äî there‚Äôs the risk of moving through the channel. But Lightning is an example of how I go from 50,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer two you could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies. Now, that‚Äôs not the end-all, be-all because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won‚Äôt be the only one ‚Äî there‚Äôs an open market competition of other permissionless, open source protocols to do this work. And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property ‚Äî deemed to be not a security ‚Äî you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin. There‚Äôs a debate about: Are there any? And what are they? And we could leave that for a later time. Lex Fridman: But why do you think of them as layer two as opposed to contending for layer one? Michael Saylor: If they‚Äôre using their own token then they are a layer one. If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee then it becomes a layer two. Bitcoin itself incentivizes it‚Äôs own transactions with its own token and that‚Äôs what makes it layer one. Lex Fridman: Okay, what‚Äôs layer three then? Lex Fridman: Don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs monopolization possibilities at layer three? So you mentioned Binance, Coinbase ‚Äî what if they start to dominate and basically everybody is using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to memorize the private key in your brain or like a cold storage of layer one technology? Michael Saylor: Well, the idealists fear the layer threes because they would detest ‚Äî there‚Äôs almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to. A layer four would be: I‚Äôve got Bitcoin on an application but I can‚Äôt withdraw it. So I‚Äôve got an application that‚Äôs backed by Bitcoin but the Bitcoin is sealed. It‚Äôs a proprietary example. An example of that would be like Grayscale: if I own a share of $GBTC and so I own a security ‚Äî actually you could own $MSTR. If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits of Bitcoin but you don‚Äôt have the ability to withdraw the asset. Lex Fridman: So you have a security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt know if I would say ‚Äî not all securities are layer four, but anything that‚Äôs a proprietary product with Bitcoin embedded in it where you can‚Äôt withdraw the Bitcoin, is another application of Bitcoin. So if you think about different ways you can use this, you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions, or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two Lightning ‚Äî and the purist would say we stay there: get your Bitcoin off the exchange. But you could also go to the layer three when Cash App supported Bitcoin they made it very easy to buy it and then they gave you the ability to withdraw. When PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it, they wouldn‚Äôt let you withdraw it and it was a big community uproar. People want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the Bitcoin so you could take it to your own private wallet and get it off the exchange. I think the answer to the question of, Well is corruption possible? is: corruption is possible in all human institutions and all governments everywhere. The difference between digital property and physical property is: when you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, can‚Äôt move the building. And when you own a share of a security that‚Äôs like a US-traded security and you wish to move to some other country, you can‚Äôt take the security with you either. And when you own a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it. So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all of those because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange. And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of stock with Fidelity and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity and if you owned some some mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things can be removed from the custodian, but the Bitcoin you can take off the exchange ‚Äî you can remove from the custodian. There‚Äôs a deterrent that‚Äôs an anti-corrupting element, and the phrase is: an armed society is a polite society. Because you have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness. And at the point where you disagree with their policies you can, within an hour, move your assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets. And you don‚Äôt have that option with most other forms of property. You don‚Äôt have as much optionality with any other form of property on Earth. And so what what makes digital property distinct is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody. Now coming back to this digital energy issue, the real key point is: the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes. It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer twos. It moves in minutes on the layer one. And I don‚Äôt think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one because it‚Äôs impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and the immortality if you try to build in that much speed and that functionality and performance. In fact, if you come back to the New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building, and a company ‚Äî that‚Äôs what makes the economy. If I said to you: you‚Äôre going to build a building but you can only have one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very fragile, very brittle. What company a hundred years ago is still relevant today? You want all three layers because they all oscillate at different frequencies. And there‚Äôs a tendency to think, Well it‚Äôs got to be this L1 or that L1 ‚Äî not really. And sometimes people think, Well I don‚Äôt really want any L3, but it‚Äôs not an either/or: companies are better than crypto-asset networks at certain things. If you want to implement complexity or you want to implement compliance or customer service, companies do these things well. You couldn‚Äôt decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube ‚Äî the performance wouldn‚Äôt be there, and the subtlety wouldn‚Äôt be there. And you can‚Äôt really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance, because they would become illegal in the political jurisdiction they‚Äôre in. So unless you‚Äôre a cryptoanarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states ‚Äî which, it‚Äôs just not very practical, not anytime soon ‚Äî once you allow that nation states will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins. For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin. There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it. And they don‚Äôt get the same market share but they might give you some other advantage. There are there are certain layer threes like Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Cash App where they just incorporated Lightning ‚Äî an implementation of it ‚Äî so that makes it more advantageous versus an application that doesn‚Äôt incorporate Lightning. If you think about the big picture: the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones served by a hundred million companies doing billions of transactions an hour, and the companies are settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of $80 million at a time, and then the companies are trading with the consumers in proprietary layers like layer three, and then on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with Lightning layer two because you don‚Äôt want to pay $5 to move $50 ‚Äî you want to pay a twentieth of a penny to move $50. And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy. And Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency: if you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years, I couldn‚Äôt find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria ‚Äî no amount of money. Give me $10 billion dollars ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt do it, because you get shut down at the banking level, you can‚Äôt link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US, you get shut down at this credit card level because they don‚Äôt have the credit card so they won‚Äôt clear, you get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because if you wouldn‚Äôt be able to implement a system that interfaced with somebody else‚Äôs system if it‚Äôs not in the right political jurisdiction. On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would trade in this Lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody‚Äôs permission. So you‚Äôre talking about something that‚Äôs like a million times cheaper, less friction, and faster to do it if you want to get money to move. Michael Saylor: I mean, Bitcoin‚Äôs a universal trust protocol. A universal energy protocol, if you will. English is one. What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications. For example, the Russian payment app is not going to work in Ukraine. The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia. The US payment apps won‚Äôt work in either of those places as far as I know. And in Argentina, their payment app may not work in certain parts of Africa. So what you have is different local economies where people spin up their own applications compliant with their own local laws, or in war zones not compliant, but just spinning up ‚Äî Lex Fridman: So how do you build something that‚Äôs not compliant? What is the revolutionary act here when you don‚Äôt agree with the government or you want to free yourself from the constraints ‚Äî so here‚Äôs the thing: when a nation is really at war, especially if it‚Äôs an authoritarian regime, it‚Äôs going to try to control the population, like lock everything down, the spread of information. How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is that you have to build another app, essentially, that allows you the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government? So basically break the law? Michael Saylor: Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English. For example, it‚Äôs not illegal to speak English ‚Äî or even if it is, it doesn‚Äôt matter. But English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network. So Bitcoin is a language, so you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak Lightning and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can. Lex Fridman: But the problem is it‚Äôs still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now during war. And there was a sense to me that cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people there. There‚Äôs millions of refugees ‚Äî they‚Äôre moving all around. It‚Äôs very difficult to move money around in that space to help people. Michael Saylor: I think we‚Äôre very early. Like, we‚Äôre very embryonic here. Lex Fridman: Who‚Äôs we? We as a human civilization? Or we operating in the cryptocurrency space? Michael Saylor: I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic, and the human race‚Äôs adoption of it is embryonic ‚Äî we‚Äôre like 1%-2% down that adoption curve. If you take Lightning, for example, the first real commercial applications of Lightning are just in the last 12 months. So we‚Äôre like year one ‚Äî we might be approaching year two of commercial Lightning adoption ‚Äî and if you look at Lightning adoption, Lightning is not built into Coinbase, it‚Äôs not built into Binance, it‚Äôs not built into FTX, Cash App just implemented the first implementation but not all of the features are built into it. There‚Äôs a few dozen, a dozen Lightning wallets circulating out there. So I think that we‚Äôre probably going to be 36 months of software development. At the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big deal. If Apple embraced Lightning, that‚Äôs a big deal. Lex Fridman: So the adoption is the thing ‚Äî like in a war zone, adoption ‚Äî the people who struggle the most in war are people who are weren‚Äôt doing that great before the war started. They don‚Äôt have the technological sophistication. The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way. It‚Äôs just regular people who are just struggling to make day-by-day living. And so if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the digital space. If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second: so he‚Äôs one of the early adopters, or he‚Äôs one of the people pushing the early adoption in this layer three inside Cash App ‚Äî what do you make of the man? Of this decision? As a business owner, as somebody playing in the space: why did he do it? And what does that mean for others at the scale that might be doing the same? So: incorporating the Lightning Network, incorporating Bitcoin into their products. Michael Saylor: I think he‚Äôs been pretty clear about this: he feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world. If you want to give an incorruptible bank to 8 billion people on the planet, that‚Äôs the same as asking the question: How do you give a full education through PhD-level to 8 billion people on the planet? And the answer is: a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone. And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace. It‚Äôs run by uncorruptable software and it‚Äôs for everybody on Earth. So I think when Jack looks at it, he‚Äôs very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa. If you look at Africans ‚Äî you‚Äôre going to give them banks? You‚Äôre not going to put a bank branch on every corner ‚Äî that‚Äôs an obscene waste of energy. You‚Äôre not going to run copper wires across the continent ‚Äî that‚Äôs an obscene waste of energy. You‚Äôre not gonna give them gold. So how are you going to provide people with a decent life? The metaphor I think is relevant here, the biological metaphor, Lex, is Type I diabetic: if you‚Äôre a Type I diabetic, you can‚Äôt form fat, and if you can‚Äôt form fat then you can‚Äôt store excess energy. Fat is the ultimate organic battery, and if you‚Äôve got 30 pounds of it you can go 60 days without eating. But if you can‚Äôt generate insulin you can‚Äôt form fat cells, and if you can‚Äôt form fat cells and store energy then you can eat yourself to death. I mean you will eat and you will die ‚Äî you‚Äôll starve to death. So the lack of property rights is like being a Type I diabetic. And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world: they don‚Äôt have property rights, they don‚Äôt have an effective bank, and their currency is broken. Like, what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of an organic battery or an economic battery to civilization? It would be: I have a currency which holds its value and I can store it in a bank. So a risk-free currency derivative. I pay you your money, you take your life savings, you put it in the bank, you save up for your retirement, you live happily ever after ‚Äî that‚Äôs the American Dream. That‚Äôs the idyllic situation. The real situation is: there are no banks, you can‚Äôt get a bank account, so I give your pay in currency and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin or I give it to whatever cause I want or I use it to buy weapons and then you find a loaf of bread costs triple next month as what it cost and your life savings is worthless. And so in that environment, everybody‚Äôs ripped back to stone age barter. And the problem with that, even with stone age barter, is: you‚Äôre going to carry your life savings on your back? And what happens when the guy with a machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings? So I think from Jack‚Äôs point of view, he thinks that life is ‚Äî this is maybe too strong but these are my words ‚Äî life is hopeless for a lot of people, and Bitcoin is hope, because it gives everyone an engineered monetary asset that‚Äôs a bearer instrument and it gives them a bank on their mobile phone and they don‚Äôt have to trust their government or another counterparty with their life force. So there‚Äôs a secondary thing I think he‚Äôs interested in which is ‚Äî the first thing is the human rights issue ‚Äî and the second thing would be: the friction to trade cross-borders is so great. Like, you like AI so I‚Äôll give you a beautiful notion: maybe one day there‚Äôll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is self-sufficient and rich. Lex Fridman: Like, that would have sovereignty? Michael Saylor: Can a robot own money or property? Can a Tesla car? Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and maintain itself forever? Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job? We have a word for that in the real world: it‚Äôs institution ‚Äî Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford ‚Äî there are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity. But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program? And with something like digital property ‚Äî with Bitcoin and Lightning ‚Äî you could do it. And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards, you couldn‚Äôt ‚Äî you couldn‚Äôt ever. So you can create things that are beautiful and lasting. And what‚Äôs the difference in speed? Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world at the speed of light friction-free in 24 hours writing a python script, or I can spend $100 billion dollars to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes them 6 months of application. The impedance is like a 10,000,000:1 difference, and the metaphors are literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit, or vacuum sealing something. Does it last forever and does it orbit forever? Or does it go up and come down and burn up? And I think Jack is interested in putting freedom in orbit. And he said it many times. He said: the Internet needs a native currency. And no political construct or security can be a native currency. You need a property. And you need a property that can be moved a million times a second. Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or 100 kilohertz? And the answer is: only if it‚Äôs a pure digital construct ‚Äî permissionless and open. And so I think he‚Äôs enthusiastic as the technologist and he‚Äôs enthusiastic as the humanitarian. And what he‚Äôs doing is to support both those areas. He‚Äôs supporting the Bitcoin and the Lightning protocols by building them into his products, but he‚Äôs also building the applications which you need at the Cash App level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality and the compliance necessary, and they‚Äôre related. Michael Saylor: First of all, Web 3.0 is a term that‚Äôs used to refer to the part of the economy that‚Äôs token finance. So if I‚Äôm launching an application and my ideas is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to finance the application and build support for it, I think that that‚Äôs the most common interpretation of Web 3.0. There are other interpretations too, and so I‚Äôm just gonna refer to that one. And I think the beef in a nutshell ‚Äî not articulated, but I‚Äôll articulate it ‚Äî is whether or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital property like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it which generally would be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community. So I‚Äôm going to put on my Bitcoin hat here: all the tokens that have been [released], if it‚Äôs driven by a venture capitalist, was a security ‚Äî if there‚Äôs a CEO and a CTO, it‚Äôs a security. All these projects ‚Äî they‚Äôre companies. Foundations are companies. If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn‚Äôt make it not a security ‚Äî they‚Äôre all in essence collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token. And if there‚Äôs a premine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation, or any kind of any kind of protocol where there is a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer or to most Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that‚Äôs steeped in securities law, you‚Äôre looking at it and you say, Well that passes the Howie test: it looks like a security. It should be sold to the public pursuant to disclosures and regulations, and you‚Äôre just ducking the IPO process. And so now we get back to the ethical issue. Well the ethical issue is: if you‚Äôre trading it as a commodity and representing it as a commodity while truthfully it‚Äôs a security, then it‚Äôs a violation of ethics rules and it‚Äôs probably illegal. Lex Fridman: Well you keep leaning on this ‚Äî let me push back on that part. Maybe you can educate me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities law ‚Äî with all due respect to lawyers ‚Äî as if that line somehow defines what is and isn‚Äôt ethical. I think there‚Äôs a lot of correlation, as you‚Äôve discussed, but and I‚Äôd like to leave the line aside. If the law calls something a security, it doesn‚Äôt mean, in my eyes, that it is unethical. I mean there could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time. But I take your bigger point that, if there‚Äôs a CEO, if there‚Äôs a project lead, to you that‚Äôs fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not that creating securities is unethical ‚Äî I created a security. I took a company public. That‚Äôs not the unethical part. It‚Äôs completely ethical to create securities. Block is a security. All companies are securities. The unethical part is to represent it as property when it‚Äôs a security, and to promote it or trade it as such. Lex Fridman: This whole promotion ‚Äî that‚Äôs also a technical thing because what counts as or as not a promotion is a legal thing, and you get in trouble for all these things, but that‚Äôs the game that lawyers play. There‚Äôs an ethical thing here which is like: what‚Äôs right to promote and not? To me, propaganda is unethical, but it‚Äôs usually not illegal. Michael Saylor: If you roll the clock back 20 years, all the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock selling swampland in Florida. And if you roll the clock forward 20 years and I create my own company and I represent it as the same thing and I don‚Äôt make the disclosures, you‚Äôre just one step removed from the boiler room scheme, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs distasteful about it. There are ways to sell securities to the public, but there are expectations. Maybe we could forget about whether the security laws are ethical or not ‚Äî I will leave that alone. We‚Äôll just start with the biblical definition of ethics: Don‚Äôt lie, cheat, or steal. So if I‚Äôm going to sell something to you, I need to fully disclose what I‚Äôm selling to you. And that‚Äôs a matter of great debate right now. And so I think that‚Äôs part of the debate. But the other part of the debate is whether or not we need more than one token. Like, we need at least one, right? We need at least one digital property. Lex Fridman: One is better than zero. Michael Saylor: Zero means there is no digital economy. And by the way, the conventional view of maximalists is they think there‚Äôs only one and everything else isn‚Äôt ‚Äî that‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm going to make. I would say: we know there is at least one digital property, and that is Bitcoin. If you can create a truly decentralized, non-custodial, bearer instrument that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed, then you might create another, or multiple. And there may be others out there. But I think that the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community ‚Äî and I share this with Jack ‚Äî is: we could create $100 trillion dollars of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin as a foundation. And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and create competitive things is a massive waste of time, and it‚Äôs a diversion of human creativity. It‚Äôs like: we have an ethical good thing and now we‚Äôre going to try to create a third or a fourth one ‚Äî why? Lex Fridman: Well let‚Äôs talk about it. So first of all I‚Äôm with you. But let me ask you this interesting question, because we talked about properties and securities. Let‚Äôs talk about conflict of interest. So you said you could advertise publicly ‚Äî you have a popular Twitter account, it‚Äôs hilarious and insightful ‚Äî you do promote Bitcoin in a sense. I don‚Äôt know if you would say that. But do you think there‚Äôs a conflict of interest in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin? Is it the same as you promoting farming? Lex Fridman: I would say: No ‚Äî there‚Äôs an interest. I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent that you don‚Äôt control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest is when you‚Äôre promoting a proprietary product or a proprietary security. A security in general is a proprietary asset. So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin ‚Äî you won‚Äôt ever see me making a statement that, say, Microstrategy stock will go up forever. I‚Äôm not promoting a security, $MSTR, because at the end of the day, $MSTR is a security. It is proprietary. I have proprietary interest in it. I have a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction. Lex Fridman: The control is the problem. Because you have interest in both: if Bitcoin is as successful as we‚Äôre talking about, you very possibly can become the richest human on Earth, given how much you own in Bitcoin. The wealthiest, not the richest ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what those words mean. Michael Saylor: I would benefit economically. Lex Fridman: You would benefit economically. Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs true. Lex Fridman: So the reason that‚Äôs not conflict of interest is because of the word property, that Bitcoin is an idea? And Bitcoin is open? Michael Saylor: Because I don‚Äôt control it. In essence, the ethical line here is: could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not? Lex Fridman: Or can anyone, right? It‚Äôs not just you. It‚Äôs: can anyone? Because, can you promote somebody else‚Äôs? Yes, I guess you can. Like, can you promote $AAPL? Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs like: you could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote family values or promote a carnivore diet or promote the iron man. Lex Fridman: But you‚Äôre not going to get wealthier if you promote camping, because you can‚Äôt own a stake in it. I mean, you own a lot of Bitcoin. What is that? Don‚Äôt you own a stake in the idea? Lex Fridman: But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line, that all you are is you‚Äôre a fan of the idea. You believe in the idea and the power of the idea. You can‚Äôt take that idea away from others. Michael Saylor: Let me give you some maybe easier examples: if you were the head of the Marine Corps and someone came to you and said, I created MarineCoin. And the twist on MarineCoin is I want you to tell every marine that they‚Äôll get an extra MarineCoin when they get their next stripe. And then I‚Äôm gonna let you buy MarineCoin now, and then after you buy MarineCoin, I want you to promote it to them. At some point, if you start to have a disproportional influence on it or if you‚Äôre in a conversation with people with disproportionate influence, it becomes conflict of interest. And it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security. Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he‚Äôs kind of wacky. Maybe like that‚Äôs kind of a waste of time, a distraction, but to the extent that canoeing is not a security, it‚Äôs not a problem. Ultimately, the issue of decentralization is really a criticism of not having‚Äî Lex Fridman: So not having a head. So can Bitcoin be replicated? All the things that you‚Äôre saying that make it a property ‚Äî can that be replicated? Michael Saylor: I think it‚Äôs possible to create other crypto properties. Lex Fridman: Does having a head of a project, [is that] a thing that limits its ability to be a property if you try to replicate a project? Is that the fundamental flaw? Michael Saylor: Look, I think the real fundamental issue is: you just never want it to change. Like, if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years. So I think Satoshi said it at one point ‚Äî he said, The nature of the software is such that by version 0.1, its genetic code was set. If there was any development team that‚Äôs continually changing it on a routine basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization, because now there‚Äôs the issue of: Who‚Äôs influencing the changes? So what you really want is a very very simple idea ‚Äî the simplest idea: I‚Äôm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy. And when someone proposes big, functional upgrades, you almost don‚Äôt really want that development to go on the base layer ‚Äî you want that development to go on the layer threes because now Cash App has a proprietary set of functionality and it‚Äôs a security, and if you‚Äôre going to promote the use of this thing, you‚Äôre not going to promote the layer three security because that‚Äôs an edge to a given entity and you‚Äôre trusting the counterparty ‚Äî you‚Äôre gonna promote the layer one or at most the layer two. Lex Fridman: Okay, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin ‚Äî and sorry to romanticize certain notions ‚Äî but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous. Maybe you can speak to whether that‚Äôs useful? But also I just like the psychology of that, to imagine that there‚Äôs a human being that was able to create something special and walk away. So first: are you Satoshi Nakamoto? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm not! No, actually ‚Äî I think the providence is really important, and if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous or pseudonymous is important. I think the founder disappearing is also important. I think that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important. I think the lack of an initial coin offering is also important. I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important. I think the fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important. I think that the simplicity of the protocol is very important. And I think that the outcome of the block size wars is very important. And all of those things add up to common property. They‚Äôre all indicia ‚Äî indicators of a digital property as opposed to a security. If there was a Satoshi sitting around sitting on top of $50 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, I don‚Äôt think it would cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property. And if I wanted to undermine a crypto-asset network, I would do the opposite of all those things: I would launch one myself, I would sell 25% or 50% to the general public, I would keep some of the initial ‚Äî I would premine some of the stuff or early mine it, and I would keep an influence on it. Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property. And so I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race and disappearing. Lex Fridman: Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt care to speculate. Lex Fridman: But do you think it was one person? Michael Saylor: I think it was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others. I mean, it might have been a group of people that were working together, but certainly there‚Äôs a Satoshi. Lex Fridman: I mean, it‚Äôs just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful. Or do you think a lot of it is an accident? Like, the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size ‚Äî all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property. Do you think that‚Äôs an accident? Or it was deeply thought through? This is almost like a history of science question. Michael Saylor: People tried forty of them, right? I mean, I think there‚Äôs a history of attempting to create something like this, and it was tried many many times and they failed for different reasons. It‚Äôs like Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked. And that‚Äôs how I see this ‚Äî this is the first one that‚Äôs sparked, and it sets a road map for us. And I and I think, if you‚Äôre looking for any one word that characterizes it: it‚Äôs fair. The whole point of the network is it‚Äôs a fair launch, a fair distribution. Like yeah, I have Bitcoin, but I bought it. And in fact, at this point we‚Äôve paid $4 billion dollars of real cash to buy it. If I was sitting on the same position and I had it for free, then there‚Äôs always this question of ‚Äî or I bought it for a nickel a coin or a penny a coin ‚Äî the question is: Was it fair? And that‚Äôs a very hard question to answer. Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly? And if you roll the clock back, you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime, but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail, right? When the risk was greater, the cost was lower ‚Äî and then over time the risk became lower and the cost became greater. And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace, absent any powerful interested actor ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years tweaking things in the background, there‚Äôd still be that question. But what we‚Äôve got is really a beautiful thing: we‚Äôve got a chain reaction in cyberspace, or an ideology spreading virally in the world that has seasoned in a fair, ethical fashion. Sometimes it‚Äôs a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility, and there‚Äôs been a lot of a lot sound and fury along the way. Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre 13 years in to this entire activity. I think the risk has never been lower. If you look at all the risks, the risks in the early years are: is the engineering protocol proper? Like, one megabyte block size, 10-minute clock frequency, cryptographies. First, will it be hacked or will it crash? 730,000 blocks in and it hasn‚Äôt crashed. Will it be hacked? It hasn‚Äôt been hacked. But it‚Äôs a Lindy thing, right? You wait 13 years to see if it‚Äôll be hacked. But on the other hand, with a billion dollars it‚Äôs not as interesting a target as it is with $100 billion, and when it gets to be worth a trillion then it‚Äôs a bigger target. So the risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized. I think the second question is: Will it be banned? You couldn‚Äôt know ‚Äî it literally could have been banned many times early on. In fact, in 2013 I tweeted on that subject: I thought it would be banned. I made a very infamous tweet: I thought it was gonna be banned. In 2014, the IRS designated it as property and gave it property tax treatment. So they they could have given it a tax treatment where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year and it probably would have crushed it to death, right? So it could have been ‚Äî in any in any number of places ‚Äî banned by a government, but in fact it was legitimized as property. And then the question is: Would it be hacked or would it be copied? Would there be something better than that? And it was copied 15,000 times. And you know the story of all those, and they either diverge to be something totally different and not comparable, or someone trying to copy a non-sovereign, bearer instrument, store of value found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is. So now we‚Äôre sitting at a point where all those risks are out of the way. I would say that year one of institutional adoption started August 2020: that‚Äôs when Microstrategy bought $250 million dollars worth of Bitcoin and we put that out on the wire. We were the first publicly-traded company to actually buy Bitcoin. I don‚Äôt think you could have found a $5 million dollar purchase from a public company before we did that. So that was kind of like a gun going off. And then in the next 12 months, Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin. And I‚Äôd say now we‚Äôre in year two of institutional adoption. And there should be 24 publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this quarter, so you‚Äôre looking at 36 publicly-traded companies, and you‚Äôve got in a range of $50 billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly-traded companies, and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin-exposed companies. So I would say the asset ‚Äî decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental. Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs to institutions, and is becoming institutionalized. So maybe decade one you go from zero to a trillion, and in decade two you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion. Lex Fridman: What about government adoption? You said institutional adoption. Are governments important in this? Maybe some governments incorporating it as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff. Is that important? And if it is, when will it happen? Lex Fridman: So inflation could be one of the sources of shock. And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it would be a bang or a whimper. Like, what is the nature of the shock? Or the transition? Michael Saylor: I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic for digital assets in general, and for for Bitcoin in particular. The Canadian trucker crisis I think educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their property rights and their banks. I think the Ukraine war was a second shock, but I think that the Russian sanctions was a third shock. I think all three ‚Äî and I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is a fourth shock, and then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock. So I think it‚Äôs a perfect storm, and if you put all these events together, what do they signify? They signify ‚Äî the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this ‚Äî is: I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust my property. I don‚Äôt know if I have property rights. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust the bank. And if I‚Äôm politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I‚Äôm going to lose my property. And if I‚Äôm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I‚Äôm still going to lose my property. And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them. And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world, such that your logical response would be: I‚Äôm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency. Like, I‚Äôll convert my peso and lira to the dollar. I‚Äôm going to convert my weak property to strong property: I‚Äôm going to sell my building downtown in Moscow and very rather own a building in New York City. I‚Äôd rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina or whatever. So I‚Äôm going to sell my weak properties and buy strong properties. I‚Äôm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets. I‚Äôd rather own a digital building than own a physical building, because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow, who can I rent that to? But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world ‚Äî anybody with money. And the maintenance cost is almost nothing, and I can hold it for a hundred years. So it‚Äôs indestructible building. And then finally, I want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty to self-custody assets. And this is not just Ukraine, but this is like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America ‚Äî you don‚Äôt really want to be sitting with $10 million dollars in a bank in Istanbul. The bank‚Äôs gonna freeze your money, convert it to lira, devalue the lira, and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right? Lex Fridman: So, self-custody assets would be layer one Bitcoin? Michael Saylor: Self-custody assets is like if I got my own hardware wallet and I‚Äôve either got ‚Äî your highest form of self-custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin in your own self-custody, and the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto dollars like Tether, like some stablecoin. If you had a choice, would you rather have your money in a bank in a war zone in dollars, or have your money in a stablecoin on your mobile phone in dollars? You‚Äôd take the latter risk rather than the former risk. Lex Fridman: In a war zone, definitely, yeah. Michael Saylor: And you can see that happening. Like, we‚Äôve gone from $5 billion in stablecoins to $200 billion in the last 24 months. So I do think there‚Äôs massive demand for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset. And everybody in the world would say, Yeah, I want that. Well, unless you‚Äôre just an extreme patriot. But most people would say, I want that. And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be able to carry my property in the palm of my hand so I have self-custody of it. Lex Fridman: So the Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster ‚Äî what do you think is the high point it‚Äôs going to hit? Michael Saylor: I think it‚Äôll go up forever. I mean, I think Bitcoin is going to climb in a serpentine fashion. It‚Äôs going to advance and come back and it‚Äôs going to keep climbing. I think that the volatility attracts all of the capital into the marketplace, and so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial universe. It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders, and that attracts capital. Like, we‚Äôre talking about the difference between a 5% return and 500% return. So the fast money is attracted by the volatility. The volatility‚Äôs been decreasing year-by-year-by-year ‚Äî I think that that it‚Äôs stabilizing. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see as much volatility in the future as we have in the past. I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, the market cap goes to between $10-$20 trillion. But remember: gold is defective property. Gold is dead money. You have a billion dollars of gold that stays in a vault for a decade ‚Äî it‚Äôs very hard to mortgage the gold. It‚Äôs also very hard to rent the gold. You can‚Äôt loan the gold. No one‚Äôs going to create a business with your gold. So gold doesn‚Äôt generate much of a yield, so for that reason, most people wouldn‚Äôt store a billion dollars for a decade in gold. They would buy a billion dollars of commercial real estate property. And the reason why is because I can rent it and generate a yield on it that‚Äôs in excess of the maintenance cost. So if you consider digital property that‚Äôs a $100-$200 trillion dollar addressable market, so I would think it goes from $10 trillion to $100 trillion as people start to think of it as digital property. Michael Saylor: At $500,000, that‚Äôs a $10 trillion dollar asset. At $5 million, that‚Äôs a $100 trillion dollar asset. Lex Fridman: So you think it crosses a million ‚Äî it can go even higher? Michael Saylor: Yeah I think it keeps going up forever. I mean, there‚Äôs no reason we couldn‚Äôt go to $10 million a coin, because digital property isn‚Äôt the highest form, right? Gold was that low frequency money. Property is a mid-frequency money. But when I start to program it faster, it starts to look like digital energy. And then it doesn‚Äôt just replace property ‚Äî then you‚Äôre starting to replace bonds. It‚Äôs $100 trillion in bonds. There‚Äôs $50-$100 trillion in other currency derivatives. And these are all conventional use cases. I think that there‚Äôs $350-$500 trillion dollars worth of currency, currency derivatives in the world. And when I say that, I mean things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows: any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt, any currency itself, any derivatives to those things ‚Äî they‚Äôre all derivatives. And they‚Äôre all defective. And they‚Äôre all defective because of this persistent 7%-14% lapse which we call inflation or monetary expansion. Can we switch subjects to talk about the energy side of it? Like, the innovative piece? Let‚Äôs just start with this idea that I‚Äôve got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms: when it becomes a dematerialized hotel ‚Äî Lex Fridman: I love that word so much by the way: dematerialized hotel. Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre across from the Fontainebleau here: imagine the Fontainebleau is dematerialized. The problem with the physical hotel is I got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of sound and physics laws and Newton‚Äôs laws and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach. But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris, London, and New York every night, and I can run it with robots. And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room-hour and I can rent it by the room-minute, and so I start to chop my hotel up into 100,000 room-hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world. And you can see all of a sudden, the yield, the rent, and the income of the property is dramatically increased. I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls. I get on Moore‚Äôs law and I‚Äôm operating in cyberspace. So I got rid of Newton‚Äôs laws ‚Äî I got rid of all the friction and all those problems ‚Äî I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace. I created a global property. I started monetizing it at different frequencies. And of course now I can mortgage it to anybody in the world. I mean, you‚Äôre not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish building from someone in South Africa ‚Äî you have to have to find someone that‚Äôs local to the culture you‚Äôre in. So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it‚Äôs not just a little bit better, it‚Äôs a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision: it‚Äôs the beauty of DeFi flash loans, money moving at high velocity. At some point, if the hotel is dematerialized, then what‚Äôs the difference between renting a hotel room and loaning a block of stock, right? I‚Äôm just finding the highest, best use of the thing. Michael Saylor: Yeah I happen to think that won‚Äôt be done by the crypto industry at all ‚Äî I think that‚Äôll be done by centralized applications. I think it‚Äôll be the citadels of the world, the high-speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers. I think it‚Äôll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield and will give you the loan and the best terms. Because ultimately you have to jump through these compliance hoops. Like, BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in compliant way with the United States jurisdiction. So ultimately those applications ‚Äî to use that digital property and either give you a loan on it or give you yield on it ‚Äî are going to come from companies. But the fundamental difference is: it could be companies anywhere in the world. So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore. I can‚Äôt send 10 city blocks of LA to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore. So you‚Äôve got a truly global market that‚Äôs functioning in this asset. And it‚Äôs a second-order asset. For example: maybe you‚Äôre an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore will generate 27% yield on the Bitcoin, but legally you can‚Äôt send the Bitcoin to them ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter, because the fact that exists means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York and then they will put on the trade in Singapore and that will create a demand for Bitcoin which will drive up the price of Bitcoin which will result in an effective tax-free yield for the person in the US that‚Äôs not even in the jurisdiction. So there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in LA, but there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of property in cyberspace, if there‚Äôs only one digital Manhattan. And so there‚Äôs a dynamic there which is profound because it‚Äôs global. But now let‚Äôs go to the next extreme. I‚Äôm still giving you a fairly conventional idea which is: let‚Äôs just loan the money fast on a global network, and let‚Äôs just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace. But let‚Äôs move to maybe a more innovative idea: the first generation of Internet brought a lot of productivity, but there‚Äôs also just a lot of flaws in it. For example: Twitter is full of garbage. Instagram DMs are full of garbage. Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage. YouTube is full of scams. Every 15 minutes there‚Äôs a Michael Sayler Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube. My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage. Millions of spam messages. I‚Äôm running four different e-mail filters. My company spends a million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other security things. There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace all the time ‚Äî it‚Äôs extreme. And we‚Äôre all beset with hostility, right? You‚Äôve been a victim of it on Twitter. You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face. And then if you look you find out that the account was created like three days ago and it‚Äôs not even a real person. So we‚Äôre beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage. Why? And the answer is because the first generation of Internet was digital information and there was no energy. There‚Äôs no conservation of energy in cyberspace. The thing that makes the universe work is conservation of energy. If I went to a hotel room, I‚Äôd have to post a credit card. And then if I smashed the place up, there‚Äôd be economic consequences, maybe there would be criminal consequences, there might be reputational consequences. A lamp might fall on me. But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room. Now imagine I could actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute, not post a credit card, and smash them all up anonymously. The thing that makes the universe work is friction: speed of sound, speed of light, and the fact that ultimately it‚Äôs conservative. You‚Äôre either energy or you‚Äôre matter, but once you‚Äôve used the energy it‚Äôs gone, and you can‚Äôt do infinite everything ‚Äî that‚Äôs missing in cyberspace right now. And if you look at all of the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products, most of them ‚Äî 99% of them ‚Äî could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace. And that‚Äôs what you can do with high-speed digital property ‚Äî high-speed Bitcoin. And by high-speed I mean, not 20 transactions a day, I mean 20,000 transactions a day. So how do you do that? Well, I let everybody on Twitter post a 1,000 or 10,000 satoshis via a Lightning wallet ‚Äî a Lightning badge. Give me an orange check. If you put up $20 bucks once in your life, you could give 300 million people an orange check. Right now you don‚Äôt have a blue check, Lex. You‚Äôre a famous person ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt have a blue check. Have you ever applied for a blue check? Lex Fridman: No. Michael Saylor: There are 360,000 people on Twitter with a blue check. There are 300 million people on Twitter. So the conventional way to verify accounts is elitist, archaic. Lex Fridman: Yeah, how does it work? How did you get a blue check? Michael Saylor: You‚Äôve got to apply and wait six months and you have to post like three articles in the public mainstream media that illustrates you‚Äôre a person of interest. Lex Fridman: Interesting. Michael Saylor: Generally they would grant them to CEOs of public companies or ‚Äî the whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are. But the question is: why isn‚Äôt everybody verified? And there‚Äôs a couple of threads on that. One is: some people don‚Äôt want to be doxxed. They want to be anonymous. But there are even anonymous people that should be verified, because otherwise you‚Äôre subjecting their entire following to phishing attacks and scams and hostility. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs the orange verification? Can you actually elaborate a little bit more? If you put up $20 bucks? Lex Fridman: And what is the power of that orange check? What what does that verify exactly? Michael Saylor: You basically post a security deposit for your safe passage through cyberspace. So the way it would work is: if you‚Äôve got $10 once in your life, you can basically show that you‚Äôre credit-worthy, and that‚Äôs your pledge to me that you‚Äôre going to act responsibly. So you put the $10 or the $20 into the Lightning wallet, you get an orange check, then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say, the only people that could DM me are orange checks, the only people that can post on my Tweets are orange checks. So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers comment, you lock out all the unverified, and that means people that don‚Äôt want to post a $10 security deposit can‚Äôt comment. Once you‚Äôve done those two things, then you‚Äôre in position to monetize malice, right? Monetize motion or malice, for that matter. But let‚Äôs just say for the sake of argument you post something and 9,700 bots spin up and pitch their whatever scam. Right now you sit and you go, Report, Report, Report, Report, Report, Report. And if you spend an hour, you get through half of them ‚Äî you waste an hour of your life ‚Äî they just spent up another 97 gazillion because they‚Äôve got a Python script spinning it up, so it‚Äôs hopeless. But on the other hand, if you report them and they really are a bot, Twitter‚Äôs got a method to actually delete the account ‚Äî they know that they‚Äôre bots. The problem is not they don‚Äôt know how to delete the account ‚Äî the problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account. So if there are consequences, Twitter could just seize the $10 or seize the $20 because it‚Äôs a bot. It‚Äôs a malicious, criminal act or whatever ‚Äî it is a violation of the platform rules. You end up seizing $10,000 ‚Äî give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the Twitter platform. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs a really powerful idea but that‚Äôs adding friction akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world. You have real consequences. Conservation of energy. Michael Saylor: There‚Äôs no friction, there‚Äôs no nothing on this Earth, right? I mean, you can‚Äôt walk across the room without friction. Friction is not bad ‚Äî unnecessary friction is bad. So in this particular case, you‚Äôre introducing conservation of energy. And in essence you‚Äôre introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace. And that means: if you do want to spin up 10 million fakes Lex Fridmans, it‚Äôs going to cost you $100 million dollars to spin up 10 million fake Lexs. Lex Fridman: But the thing is, you could do that with the dollar, but in your case you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: Yeah, well let‚Äôs follow up on that idea a bit more: if you did do it with the dollar, then the question is, How do 6 billion people deposit the dollars? Because what you‚Äôre doing is ‚Äî could you do it with a credit card? Like, how do you send dollars? Well, you have to dox yourself. Like, it‚Äôs not easy. So you‚Äôre talking about inputting a credit card transaction, doxing yourself, and now you‚Äôve just eliminated the 2 billion people that don‚Äôt have credit cards or don‚Äôt have banks. You‚Äôve also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous. But you‚Äôve also got this other problem which is: credit credit cards are expensive transactions, low frequency, slow settlement. So do you really want to pay 2.5% every time you actually show a $20 deposit? And maybe you could do a kludgy version of this for a subset of people ‚Äî it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment rails. But what you can‚Äôt do is the next idea, which is: I want the orange badge to be used to give me safe passage through cyberspace tripping across every platform. So how do I solve the denial of service attacks against a website? I publish a website ‚Äî you hit it with a million requests. Now how do I deal with that? Well I can lock you out and I can make it a zero-trust website and then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trusted credential, but that‚Äôs a pretty draconian thing. Or, I could put it behind a Lightning wall. A Lightning wall would be: I just challenge you Lex ‚Äî you want to browse my website, you have to show me your 100,000 satoshis. Do you have 100,000 satoshis? Click, Okay. Now you click away a hundred times or a thousand times, and after a thousand times I‚Äôm like, Well now Lex you‚Äôre getting offensive. I‚Äôm gonna take a satoshi from you, or 10 satoshis ‚Äî a microtransaction. You want to hit me a million times? I‚Äôm taking all your satoshis and locking you out. What you want to do is you want to go through 200 websites a day and every time you cross a domain you need to be able to in a split second prove that you‚Äôve got some asset. And now when you cross back, when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back. So how do I, in a friction-free fashion, browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for safe passage, and then get it back? You couldn‚Äôt afford to pay a credit card fee each time. When you think about 2.5% as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money 40 times and it‚Äôs gone! It‚Äôs gone. Michael Saylor: I think you need two things: you need an idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin that‚Äôs a bearer instrument for final settlement, and then you need a high-speed transaction network like Lightning where the transaction cost might be a 20th of a penny or less. And if you roll the clock back 24 months, I don‚Äôt think you had the Lightning Network in a stable point. It‚Äôs really just the past 12 months. It‚Äôs an idea you could think about this year, and I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary speculative asset. So I really think we‚Äôre just at the beginning. Lex Fridman: The embryonic stage. I have to ask: Michael Saylor, you said before, There‚Äôs no second best to Bitcoin. What would be the second best? Traditionally there‚Äôs Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano with proof-of-stake, Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains, Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme, privacy with Monero ‚Äî I just can keep going. There‚Äôs of course after the block size wars the different offshoots of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you‚Äôve got crypto property ‚Äî Bitcoin is the king of that, and other Bitcoin forks that want to be an a bearer instrument store of value would be a property, a Bitcoin Cash or a Litecoin, something like that ‚Äî then you‚Äôve got cryptocurrencies. I don‚Äôt think Bitcoin‚Äôs a currency, because a currency I define in nation state sense: a currency is an a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction without incurring a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable yen ‚Äî a stablecoin. So I think you‚Äôve got cryptocurrencies ‚Äî Tether, Circle most famous ‚Äî then you‚Äôve got crypto platforms, and Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms. The platform with smart contract functionality, etc. And then I think you‚Äôve got just crypto securities ‚Äî it‚Äôs just like my favorite whatever meme coin and I love it because I love it and it‚Äôs attached to my game or my company or my persona or my whatever. I think if pushed me and said, Well what‚Äôs the second best? I would say the world wants two things: it wants crypto property as a savings account and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account. And that means that the most popular thing really is going to be a stablecoin dollar. And there‚Äôs maybe a fight right now ‚Äî it might be Tether. But a stable dollar ‚Äî it‚Äôs not clear that there‚Äôll be one that will win. The class of stable dollars is probably a $1-$10 trillion dollar market, easily. I think that in the crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and Binance smart chain and the like. Lex Fridman: Are there certain characteristics of any of them that kind of stand out to you? Or don‚Äôt you think the competition is based on a set of features? Also ‚Äî the set of features that the cryptocurrency provides ‚Äî but also the community that it provides. Don‚Äôt you think the community matters and sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption both across the developers and the Internet? Michael Saylor: If I‚Äôm looking at them, I mean the first question is: What‚Äôs the regulatory risk? How likely is it to be deemed a property versus a security? And the second is: What‚Äôs the competitive risk? And the third is: What‚Äôs the speed and the performance? And the all of those things lead to the question of: What‚Äôs the security risk? How likely is it to crash and burn? And how stable or unstable is it? And then there‚Äôs the marketing risk. I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind them. I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms. And I think that won‚Äôt be determined until the end of the first Biden administration. For example, there are people that would like only US FDIC-insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies. They want J.P. Morgan to issue a crypto dollar backed one-to-one. But then in the US right now we have Circle and we have other companies that are licensed entities that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but they‚Äôre not FDIC-insured banks. There‚Äôs also a debate in Congress about whether state-chartered banks should be able to issue these things. And then we have Tether and others that are outside of the US jurisdiction, they‚Äôre probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents ‚Äî they‚Äôre backed by stuff, and we don‚Äôt know what stuff. And then finally you have UST and DAI which are algorithmic stablecoins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance framework. So if you ask who‚Äôs going to win, the question is really: Will the market decide? Or will the regulators decide? If the regulators get out of the way and the market fought it out, well then it‚Äôs an interesting discussion. And then I think that all bets are off if the regulators get more heavy-handed with this. And I think you could have the same discussion with crypto properties. Like, the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges, the SEC would like to regulate the crypto exchanges, they‚Äôd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges. That means they may regulate the crypto platforms, and at what rate? And in what fashion? And so I think that I could give you an opinion if it was limited to competition under the current regulatory regime, but I think that the regulations are so fast-moving and it‚Äôs so uncertain that you can‚Äôt make a decision without considering the potential actions of the regulators. Michael Saylor: I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency, so unless your crypto-asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value of the dollar, it‚Äôs not a currency ‚Äî it‚Äôs a property or it‚Äôs an asset. Lex Fridman: So then can you steelman the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then, because Bitcoin is not even in that list? Michael Saylor: The debate is going to be whether it‚Äôs property or a security, and there‚Äôs a debate whether it‚Äôs decentralized enough. So let‚Äôs assume it was decentralized ‚Äî well it‚Äôs increasing at what, 5% a year inflation rate? But it‚Äôs not 5% exponentially, it‚Äôs like a plus 5 million something capped at less ‚Äî I forget the exact number, but it‚Äôs an inflationary property. It‚Äôs got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar and it‚Äôs got a much lower inflation rate than many other fiat currencies, so I think you could say that. Lex Fridman: But don‚Äôt you see the power of meme? The power of ideas? The power of fun or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community? Michael Saylor: I do, but there are meme stocks ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt absolve you of your ethical and securities liabilities if you‚Äôre promoting it. So I don‚Äôt have a problem with people buying a stock. It‚Äôs just, the way I divide the world is: there‚Äôs investment, there‚Äôs saving, there‚Äôs speculation, and there‚Äôs trading. So Bitcoin is an asset for saving ‚Äî if you want to save money for 100 years, you don‚Äôt really want to take on execution risk or the like. So you‚Äôre just buying something to hold forever. For you to actually endorse something as a property ‚Äî like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next hundred years? I‚Äôd say, Well, some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin. You can run your company ‚Äî but running your company is an investment. So the savings are properties. If you said, What should I invest in? I‚Äôd say, Well here‚Äôs a list of good companies. Private companies ‚Äî you can start your own company ‚Äî that‚Äôs an investment. If you said, What should I trade? Well trading is like a proprietary thing ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have any special insight into that. If you‚Äôre a good trader, you know you are. If you said to me, What should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks and meme coins, and it kind of sits up there right in the same space with what horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on and should you bet on black six times in a row and double down each time? I mean it‚Äôs fun, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a speculation, right? You can‚Äôt build a civilization ‚Äî Lex Fridman: On speculation. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not an institutional asset. And in fact, where I‚Äôd leave it is: Bitcoin is clearly digital property, which makes it an institutional-grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure, a public investor, or anybody that‚Äôs risk-adverse. I think that the other the Top-100 other cryptos are like venture capital investments. And if you‚Äôre a VC and if you‚Äôre a qualified technical investor and you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk, then you can parse through that and form opinions. It‚Äôs just orders of magnitude more risky because of competition, because of ambition, and because of regulation. And if you take the meme coins, it‚Äôs like when some rapper comes out with a meme coin it‚Äôs like maybe it‚Äôll peak when I hear about it. I mean, SHIB was created as a coin such that it had so many zeros after the decimal point that when you looked at it on the exchanges it always showed zero zero zero zero and it wasn‚Äôt until like six months after it got popular that they started expanding the display so you could see whether the price had changed. Lex Fridman: That‚Äôs speculation. Maybe you can correct me, but you‚Äôve been critical of Elon Musk in the past in the crypto space. Where do you stand on Elon‚Äôs effect on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general these days? Lex Fridman: Well that was one of them, but I think it‚Äôs like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally the crypto community ‚Äî what you call the crypto entrepreneurs ‚Äî it‚Äôs also they‚Äôre using it for investment, for speculation, and therefore get very passionate about celebrities, including you, like famous people, saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto thing you can buy on Coinbase. And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk that he‚Äôs promoting Bitcoin and then not, and promoting Dogecoin and then not, and there‚Äôs so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic. And I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the ‚Äî Michael Saylor: Look ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have a criticism of Elon Musk. He‚Äôs free to do whatever he wishes to do ‚Äî it‚Äôs his life. In fact, Elon Musk is the second-largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world. So I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit. It tends to be very self-critical. And instead of saying, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money, they focus upon ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just ‚Äî Michael Saylor: So I mean I think he‚Äôs free to do what he wants to do, and I think he‚Äôs done a lot of good for Bitcoin in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it, and I think that sent a very powerful message. Lex Fridman: Do you have advice for young people? So you‚Äôve had a heck of a life: you‚Äôve done quite a lot of things ‚Äî before MIT ‚Äî but starting with MIT. Is there advice you have for young people in high school and college? How to have a career they can be proud of? How to have a life they can be proud of? Michael Saylor: I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children ‚Äî he had twins ‚Äî when they enter adulthood. He said, Give me your advice for them in a letter ‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to give it to them when they turn 21 or something. So I was at a party and then he handed me this sheet of paper and I thought, Oh, he wants me to write it down right now. So I sat down I started writing and I figured, Well, what would you want to tell someone at age 21? Lex Fridman: You wrote it down? Awesome. Michael Saylor: I wrote it down and I tweeted it and it‚Äôs sitting on Twitter but I‚Äôll tell you what I said. I said ‚Äî my advice if you‚Äôre entering adulthood: focus your energy, guard your time, train your mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends, curate your environment, keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world. That was the ten. Lex Fridman: Upgrade the world ‚Äî that‚Äôs an interesting choice of words. Upgrade the world, upgrade the world ‚Äî Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs like an engineer‚Äôs dream. Lex Fridman: Yeah it‚Äôs very engineering-themed. Keep your promises, too ‚Äî that‚Äôs an interesting one. Michael Saylor: I think most people suffer because they just don‚Äôt focus. Like, you‚Äôve got to figure out ‚Äî I think the big risk in this world is there‚Äôs too much of everything. Like, you can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week and you‚Äôll never get through all the chess videos. There‚Äôs too much of every possible thing, too much of every good thing. So figuring out what you want to do ‚Äî and then everything will suck up your time, right? There‚Äôs a hundred streaming channels to binge watch. So you gotta guard your time and then train your body, train your mind, and control who‚Äôs around you, control what surrounds you. So ultimately, in a world where there‚Äôs too much of everything ‚Äî Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs like those laser eyes. It‚Äôs like those laser eyes ‚Äî you have to focus on just a few of those things. Michael Saylor: Yeah I mean I‚Äôve got a thousand opinions we could talk about and I could pursue a thousand things, but I don‚Äôt expect to be successful, and I‚Äôm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more valid than the leader of thought in that area, so how about if I just focus upon one thing and then deliver the best I can in the one thing ‚Äî that‚Äôs the laser eye message. The rest get you distracted. Lex Fridman: Well how do you achieve that? Do you find yourself, given where you are in life, having to say No a lot? Or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything around you? So how do you achieve that focus? Michael Saylor: I think it helps if people know what you‚Äôre focused on. Lex Fridman: So everything about you just radiates that people know ‚Äî people know this is ‚Äî Michael Saylor: If they know what you‚Äôre focused on, then you won‚Äôt get so many other things coming your way. If you dally or if you flirt with 27 different things, then you‚Äôre going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right? Lex Fridman: You mentioned getting a PhD ‚Äî and given your roots at MIT ‚Äî there‚Äôs all kinds of journeys you can take to educate yourself. Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it? Or are there other paths through life? Michael Saylor: Is it worth it if you have to pay for it or is it worth it to spend the time on it? Lex Fridman: The time and the money is a big cost. Time probably the bigger one, right? Michael Saylor: I think it seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert in and to focus in on one area, and it‚Äôs punishing generalist jack-of-all-trades, but especially people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you‚Äôre a specialist in the digital realm, you‚Äôre the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter and you show them how to tie knots, or you‚Äôre the banjo player with 1.8 million followers and when everybody types banjo ‚Äî it‚Äôs you. And so the world wants people that do something well, and then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them. And so that argues in favor of focus. I mean, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they‚Äôre capable of or have made ‚Äî I guess to get a PhD, technically you have to have done a dissertation where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. And if you haven‚Äôt done that, technically you have a master‚Äôs degree but you‚Äôre not a doctor. So if you‚Äôre interested in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists ‚Äî you know the Agadmator on YouTube? Lex Fridman: Yeah yeah yeah. Michael Saylor: He‚Äôs the world‚Äôs greatest chess commentator. And I‚Äôve watched his career and he‚Äôs got progressively better ‚Äî and he‚Äôs really good! Lex Fridman: He‚Äôs going to love hearing this. Michael Saylor: Yeah if the Agadmator ever hears this: I‚Äôm a big fan of the Adadmator. I have to cut myself off because otherwise you‚Äôll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend. But the point really is: YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something, and they rise to the top of their profession. And Twitter is, too, and the Internet is. So I would advocate that you figure out what you‚Äôre passionate about and what you‚Äôre good at and you do focus on it ‚Äî especially if the thing that you‚Äôre doing can be automated, the problem is back to that 500,000 algebra teacher-type comment ‚Äî the problem is if it is possible to be automated, then over time someone‚Äôs probably going to automate it, and that squeezes the state space of everybody else. Like, after the lockdowns, it used to be there were like all these local bands that played in bars and everybody went to the bar to see the local band. And then during the lockdown you would have like these six super-groups and they would all get 500,000 or 1 million followers, and all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all. Michael Saylor: Yeah if you‚Äôre going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays, I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play. Like, I want you to be the Shakespeare dude. Just like ‚Äî Lex, you‚Äôre the deep-thinking podcaster, right? Or you‚Äôre the podcaster that goes after the deep intellectual conversations. And once I get comfortable with you and I like you, then I start binge watching Lex. But if you changed your format through 16 different formats so that you could compete with 16 different other personalities on YouTube, you probably wouldn‚Äôt beat any of them, right? You would probably just kind of sink into the #2 or #3 guy ‚Äî you‚Äôre not the #1 guy in the format. And I think the algorithm ‚Äî the Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithms ‚Äî they really reward the person that‚Äôs focused, on message, consistent. The world wants somebody they can trust that‚Äôs consistent and reliable, and they kind of want to know what they‚Äôre getting into, because ‚Äî and this is taken for granted, maybe ‚Äî but there‚Äôs 10 million people vying for every hour of your time, and so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all is a huge privilege, right? Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs amazing. Michael Saylor: And you should be thanking them, and you should respect their time. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs interesting ‚Äî like, everything you said is very interesting, but of course from my perspective, and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with it. It‚Äôs just being focused on stuff ‚Äî and in my case it‚Äôs focused on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself and not caring about anything else. Like, I don‚Äôt care about views or likes or attention, and just maintaining that focus is the way. From an individual perspective, you live that life, but it does seem that the world and technology is rewarding the specialization and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And then that lifts all boats, actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to do specific things, and they educate themselves, and it‚Äôs just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable and more and more empowered. Michael Saylor: The reward for authenticity more than offsets the specificity with which you pursue your mission. Another way to say it is: nobody wants to read advertising. If you were to spend $100 million dollars advertising your thing, I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to watch it. Lex Fridman: Yeah. That‚Äôs so fascinating. Michael Saylor: We see the death of that. And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences, and the authentic specialists or the authentic artists are gaining their audience. Lex Fridman: And that‚Äôs a beautiful thing. Speaking of deep thinking: you‚Äôre just a human. Your life ends. You‚Äôve accumulated so much wisdom, so much money, but the ride ends. Do you think about that? Do you ponder your death? Your mortality? Are you afraid of it? Michael Saylor: When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation, and the foundation‚Äôs mission is to make education free for everybody, forever. And if I‚Äôm able to contribute to the creation of a more perfect monetary system, then maybe that foundation will go on forever, right? Lex Fridman: The idea ‚Äî the foundation of the idea. So each of the foundations. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not clear we‚Äôre on the S-curve of immortal life yet ‚Äî like that‚Äôs a biological question and you ask that on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on the threshold of immortal life for ideas, or immortal life for certain institutions or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected endowment. And then the question really is: what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind? And so if it‚Äôs a park then you endow the park. If it‚Äôs free education then you endow that. If it‚Äôs some other ethical idea, right? Les Fridman: Does it make you sad that there‚Äôs something that you‚Äôve endowed, some very powerful idea of digital energy, that you help put it into the world, and that your mind ‚Äî your conscious mind ‚Äî will no longer be there to experience it? It‚Äôs just gone forever? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôd rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is: you should do your part during some phase of the journey and then you should get out of the way. And I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very famous speech one day, which is: Death is a natural part of life and it makes way for the next generation. And I think the goal is: you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, bad things happen. I think nature cleanses itself. There‚Äôs a cycle of life. Lex Fridman: And speaking of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington ‚Äî so, hopefully, when you get out of the way, nobody‚Äôs bleeding you to death in hope of helping you. To do a bit of a callback: what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? What‚Äôs the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization ‚Äî it seems like we‚Äôre engineers at heart. We‚Äôll build cool stuff. Better and better use of energy ‚Äî channeling energy to be productive. Why? What‚Äôs it all for? Michael Saylor: You‚Äôre getting metaphysical on me. Lex Fridman: Very ‚Äî there‚Äôs a beautiful boat to the left of us: like, why do we do that? This boat that sailed the ocean. Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past. Michael Saylor: To engineer is divine. You can make lots of arguments as to why we‚Äôre here. We‚Äôre either here to entertain ourselves or we‚Äôre here to create something that‚Äôs beautiful, or something that‚Äôs functional. I think if you‚Äôre an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that‚Äôs both beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things: it‚Äôs entertaining, but it‚Äôs ethical. You‚Äôve got to admire the first person that built a bridge ‚Äî crossing a chasm ‚Äî or the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village, or the first person that figured out how to dam up a river, or mastered agriculture, or the guy that figured out how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees and he‚Äôs pretty proud of himself. Lex Fridman: So that‚Äôs functional. There is also something to that ‚Äî just like you said ‚Äî that it‚Äôs just beautiful. It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. When you step back and look at the entirety of it ‚Äî a collective of humans using a beautiful invention or a creation or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music ‚Äî that seems just right. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we‚Äôre here for that. And I of course love talking to you because, from the engineering perspective, the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty. Michael Saylor: Isn‚Äôt there something beautiful about about making the world a better place for people that you love? Your friends, your family, or yourself? When you think about the entire arc of human existence and you roll the clock back 500,000 years and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us and everything they had to overcome in order to put you here right now, you‚Äôve got to admire that. You‚Äôve got to respect that. Lex Fridman: That‚Äôs a heck of a gift they gave us. It‚Äôs also a heck of a responsibility. Don‚Äôt screw it up. Michael Saylor: If I dropped you 100,000 years ago and I said, Figure out steel refining. Or figure out silicon chips, fab reproduction, or whatever it is ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Or fire. Michael Saylor: And so now we‚Äôre here, and I guess the way you repay them is: you fix everything in front of your face you can. To someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet. To someone like me I think: fix the energy in the system. Lex Fridman: And that gives me hope. Michael, this is an incredible conversation. You‚Äôre an incredible human. It‚Äôs a huge honor you would sit down with me. Thank you so much for talking today. Michael Saylor: Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex. Distraction-free reading. No ads.

;;Hey, Michael Saylor, I Have 1% of 1 Bitcoin...;"$0.71 Let's be clear ..100% Michael Saylor will never read this post, because he is super busy promoting Bitcoin and managing a company. But, it would be cool to get a response from him! At any rate... I remember a while back Saylor talked about getting your hands on as much Bitcoin as you could before Wall Street and big companies, like BlackRock and the like, did. The reason was simple...a hedge against inflation. Protection of wealth and holding it is super important, as in the phrase, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. He talked about the poorest of people having just 1% of 1 Bitcoin would be a game changer. ""If you had just 1% of 1 Bitcoin, you would be better off than 90% of the population..."" (Not quoted exactly, but that was close to his words...) Well Michael Saylor, I have over 1% (about .04 Bitcoin) and at this exact moment, I don't feel 'better off'...and that is probably because I know Saylor himself has over 150,000 FULL Bitcoins...lol All joking aside, he has a great point. I am looking to continue gathering until I have at least .25 Bitcoin and that will be enough for me. Some of you will have more, but that is fine, because you will be in a great place later on. Thanks Saylor for helping me to see why Bitcoin is as important as it is, and hopefully you will continue doing all you can to get the masses into it before more gets lost in the big money machine... Thanks for reading, and please tell me your thoughts in the comments below...üëáüèª How do you rate this article? 66 I'm Cody and will post about anything christian, crypto, and sometimes crazy... I was involved with crypto since 2012, but left after homelessness entered my life. Now I am back, (since July of 2020) and ready to live this crypto life!

;;Bitcoin‚Äôs Crypto Market Share Will Almost Double, Predicts MicroStrategy‚Äôs Saylor;                                                 ;www.bloomberg.com;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-13/microstrategy-s-mstr-saylor-says-bitcoin-btc-market-share-will-climb-to-80;
;;;These are exciting times for crypto. Unless you sealed yourself into an underground bunker when the pandemic broke out, only to find that you couldn‚Äôt get a phone signal down there and nobody had turned up to connect the Wi-Fi, then you‚Äôll have noticed that we are currently in the midst of a bull run. Bitcoin has blazed past its 2017 all-time high and isn‚Äôt stopping yet, while the altcoin market is following along in its wake. For many of us, its been a ray of light in an otherwise gloomy year. The last bull market, back in 2017, came to a pretty abrupt and painful end. Bitcoin fell from over $17,000 in December of that year to less than $7,000 a couple of months later. By early 2019, you could pick up one BTC for under $4,000. Ouch. Many critics wrote BTC and other cryptos off as overly volatile assets that wouldn‚Äôt last. What‚Äôs important to note is that, back in 2017, that bull run was largely driven by retail investors piling in and hoping to make a quick profit. It was driven as much by hype and FOMO as by any deeper understanding or appreciation of crypto‚Äôs potential. As such, it‚Äôs no surprise that prices subsequently tanked. Fast forward to 2020 and the picture is radically different. This bull run is testing new highs, with hundreds more cryptos having emerged since the last one, and this time it‚Äôs not being driven by every man and his dog opening up a Coinbase account and having a punt. The money powering this surge is coming from institutional investors, and boy do they have a lot to spend. Big companies and investment giants are queuing up to buy BTC and many are predicting that this is only the beginning of what could be a surge in price and adoption that will put 2017 in the shade. Back in 2017 there was no shortage of powerful men in expensive suits eager to write bitcoin off. Mainstream finance seemed either appalled or indifferent and not even the longest of lunches would induce any major CEO to put so much as a dime of their company‚Äôs money into it. Bitcoin was ‚Äòmagic internet money‚Äô and the preserve of drug dealers and fraudsters. Time moved on. BTC rallied, though nowhere close to its previous heights. The world kept turning, Trump kept doing his thing, Brexit kept not getting done and we all tried to stay excited about ETH 2.0. The altcoin market kept growing and everyone wondered when the next bull run would come. Then people started getting ill in Wuhan. When the WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic, markets around the world went into freefall and so too did the price of BTC. But then, as stimulus money was pumped into economies to keep them from collapsing and dire predictions began to be made about hyperinflation, BTC took off. Investors everywhere began to realise that they needed to diversify their holdings. Some went for gold, a safe haven asset for the ages. But others saw that the best hedge against inflation was an asset with a fixed supply and which was stored on an immutable, public and decentralised ledger. An asset which many still viewed with deep suspicion. Huge piles of corporate cash are now being ploughed into BTC. PayPal recently announced that its customers would be able to buy and spend it and other cryptos on its platform. Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Square put $50 million into BTC back in October. Just a couple of weeks ago life insurance giant Mass Mutual was revealed to have gone in with $100 million. If anyone had predicted any of this back in 2017 they would probably have been taken away by men in white coats. Leading the way in getting corporate bucks into bitcoin however was business intelligence and software company MicroStrategy and its all-powerful founder and CEO Michael Saylor. To date, the company has over $1 billion invested in BTC and Saylor is one of its most forthright evangelists. MicroStrategy‚Äôs share price is soaring and its eye-watering investment is prompting yet more institutions to hop aboard the BTC express. So, what is MicroStrategy, who is Michael Saylor and what does all this mean for the future of crypto? Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of MicroStrategy‚Äôs splurge on bitcoin (other than that $1 billion figure) is the fact that the company itself has no previous involvement with crypto. Its massive investment is driven by Saylor‚Äôs deeply-held faith in bitcoin and its value in a post-Covid world. The crypto space is full of people and organisations ready to talk up bitcoin‚Äôs potential and value, but MicroStrategy has shown that the hype has now spread well beyond crypto‚Äôs borders. MicroStrategy provides business intelligence services to its clients, along with educational materials, analytics and software tools to streamline workflows. Since being founded by Saylor and his business partner Sanju Bansal in 1989, it has become a market leader in its field, with over 2,000 employees and thousands of clients across the world. In 2019 it generated $486 million in revenue, with a $2.4 billion market cap. Its share price is currently around $330, having been around $144 at the start of 2020. These figures may pale in comparison to some of the big Silicon Valley tech companies that have also enjoyed a bumper 2020, but MicroStrategy has now been around for over 30 years and his holdings have made Saylor a billionaire. This is no blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it success story. If bitcoin does indeed go where Saylor thinks it will, then both he and MicroStrategy are set to get a whole lot richer. Michael Saylor was born in Nebraska in 1965. His father was in the US Air Force and so Michael spent much of his early life on airbases around the world, before the family settled in Ohio when he was eleven. He initially harboured dreams of becoming a pilot, and was accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an Air Force ROTC scholarship in 1983. Whilst at MIT he double-majored in aeronautics and astronautics, (yup, pretty sure that is a fancy way of saying rocket science), graduating in 1987. It was also while at MIT that he first met Sanju Bansal. When he was misdiagnosed with a heart murmur that ruled out his becoming a pilot, Saylor instead joined The Federal Group, Inc. ‚Äì a consulting firm which promptly put his computer skills to good work designing simulation modelling. A year later he moved to DuPont, where he continued developing computer modelling programs. Saylor and Bansal started MicroStrategy in 1989, using $250,000 in seed capital provided by DuPont. The pair drew on what they had both learnt at MIT to produce data mining and business intelligence software, eventually securing a $10 million contract with McDonald‚Äôs in 1992. From there revenues began to climb and MicroStrategy soon had to upscale, moving its offices and staff from Delaware to more spacious premises in Virginia in 1994. In 1998 the company went public in an IPO, selling four million of its shares at $12 apiece. Saylor‚Äôs star was by now also on the rise and he was heralded for his entrepreneurial skills by the likes of Ernst & Young, KPMG and the MIT Technology Review for his achievements. His reputation and his personal fortune suffered a blow in March 2000 however, when he was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of inaccurately reporting MicroStrategy‚Äôs financial results. In December 2000 he eventually settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing, resulting in a $350,000 fine and a personal disgorgement payment of just over $8 million. This hit to his finances was nothing when compared to the subsequent fall in MicroStrategy‚Äôs share price, which wiped a further $6 billion from his net worth. Despite this setback, as well as reports of a hard-partying and lavish lifestyle, Saylor retained his place at the top of MicroStrategy and has continued to steer the company, even while spending a lot of his time away from the office in places like Florida and St. Tropez. This feat is all the more impressive given that the company‚Äôs share price remained relatively moribund in the years following the SEC investigation. He used some of his spare time to found the Saylor Academy, a non-profit organisation designed to ‚Äòoffer free and open online courses to all who want to learn.‚Äô To date it has partnered with a number of educational institutions to provide access to nearly 100 college and professional-level courses via its website. Although some saw fit to criticise Saylor for not spending too much time on his yacht and his side-projects, he was all-the-while keeping abreast of technological change and its likely effects on society. He outlined his ideas on where he saw the worlds of science and technology heading in his 2012 book The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. In this book he identifies many ways in which mobile technology will affect our daily lives, including - intriguingly ‚Äì his belief that monetary and payment systems will be one of the sectors that will see the most change. It was this eye on the future that enabled Saylor to keep MicroStrategy ticking along, as he constantly sought to keep the company evolving and thus staying ahead of its competitors. Let‚Äôs face it, without bitcoin MicroStrategy would probably have continued to tick along, doing what it does and letting the more glamorous denizens of Silicon Valley hog the limelight. It‚Äôs never going to have the sex appeal of an Apple or a Tesla and it‚Äôs hard to imagine business analytics software getting many pulses racing. But it turns out that sparks flew when Michael Saylor and bitcoin came together, despite his initial prediction that nothing would come of it. In the last few years Saylor has become one of bitcoin‚Äôs greatest apostles, spreading the word far and wide and likening it to ‚Äòa battery charged with monetary energy‚Äô and ‚Äòa chain reaction spreading like a fire in cyberspace.‚Äô In a good way, that is. Saylor reportedly owns 17,732 bitcoins personally, bought at an average of $9,882 ‚Äì a position which convinced his company to get involved as well. His Twitter feed is a non-stop parade of bitcoin-positive opinions and soundbites, while YouTube is well-stocked with videos of him singing its praises. One is left with the impression that, even if he‚Äôs only half right, this current bull run we‚Äôre enjoying is merely the tip of one almighty iceberg. Again, in a good way. And so to the small matter of MicroStrategy‚Äôs investment in BTC. While the likes of Grayscale may have even more invested in the digital gold, it‚Äôs MicroStrategy‚Äôs previous status as a non-crypto company that makes its huge commitment all the more telling. The company‚Äôs investment is twofold. Firstly, $450 million in cash from its balance sheet was ploughed into BTC in a series of transactions, which bought it a little over 38,000 bitcoins by the middle of September this year. Then in early December the company issued a convertible note sale to raise $650 million, which it announced it would be using to buy yet more BTC. This essentially means that MicroStrategy has saddled itself with over half a billion dollars of debt in order to increase its BTC holdings. Just a couple of days ago, the company announced that it had secured another 29,646 BTC using the proceeds from the sale of its debt. This means that it now holds 70,470 BTC in its reserves, worth around $1.5 billion. Given that it has paid an average of $15,964 for every bitcoin it now owns, the company is already sitting on a healthy profit from its investment. In Saylor‚Äôs own words, ‚Äòthe stock is up $100 a share, and bitcoin is up, and everybody‚Äôs happy.‚Äô Having helmed MicroStrategy for three decades without generating too much in the way of hype, Michael Saylor has now lit a fire underneath bitcoin which is helping to propel its latest and most exciting surge in price. As we have seen, this bull run is markedly different from its 2017 predecessor, with the money now flooding in from some big players. There is a whole lot of belief, from a whole lot of super smart and super rich people, that bitcoin is going to go even higher and could become the asset to hold in the uncertain years that lie ahead. We may avoid hyperinflation and the world economy may well recover better than expected from the ravages of Covid. Let‚Äôs hope so. But even if we do, it looks like bitcoin‚Äôs time has come and it has broken out into the mainstream. There is no shortage of people out there ready and willing to hype bitcoin to the moon and beyond. Some are cranks and some have more than a little skin in the game, having themselves been behind the development of crypto for the last few years. But Michael Saylor truly takes matters to the next level in this regard. He has shown himself as not only willing to invest his own money in BTC, but also his company‚Äôs balance sheet and debt into the bargain. Saylor believes that we are still at the beginning of this upward trajectory and that it‚Äôs not too late for corporate or private investors to get into BTC. In his own words: With all these technologies, I think, the time to buy them is when they‚Äôre big enough that it‚Äôs obvious they work and they‚Äôve got massive momentum, but when 99% of the people on the street don‚Äôt understand them. Bitcoin is indeed a word on many lips, but still a concept which few can adequately explain. But those with deep pockets are getting their heads around it and are starting to buy it up like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. MicroStrategy, PayPal and Square‚Äôs investments are all big news, but Mass Mutual‚Äôs entry into the fray marks yet another big moment for BTC, as it finds itself in the sights of a company with $234 billion in assets under management. The floodgates could be about to open. 2021 is going to be an interesting year for many reasons, but bitcoin‚Äôs journey through it should be one of the most riveting.

Subject a man to two decades of Wall Street shenanigans ‚Äî from before the dot-com boom until now ‚Äî and you get Michael Saylor.  The former MicroStrategy CEO and relentless Bitcoin bull is back in our feeds. In a recent podcast, Saylor huffed at the notion that buying almost $5 billion worth of bitcoin took ‚Äúconviction.‚Äù  Saylor says: ‚ÄúHow many chairs are you sitting on right now? Are you all-in on the chair? The point is you put on one pair of glasses, one pair of AirPods. You look at me through one screen, you‚Äôre using one microphone. That‚Äôs one microphone ‚Äî you trust it? Is that conviction? That seems kind of scary, why don‚Äôt you diversify? Why don‚Äôt you use 10 microphones?‚Äù The point is that we believe in lots of things in our everyday lives (like what knives we choose, says Saylor ‚Äî we probably wouldn‚Äôt trust knives made of rubber bands, does that mean we have conviction in stainless steel?) It sounds silly (because it is). It‚Äôs just that Michael Saylor wants you to know that Bitcoin is as obvious to him as anything other tool he uses in real life, from airplanes to roads (‚ÄúIf you get on an airplane, are you convicted? You put your entire family on one airplane, aren‚Äôt you afraid?‚Äù) As goofy as all this is, Saylor has so far been right about Bitcoin ‚Äî now up more than $1 billion on MicroStrategy‚Äôs purchases to date. In a world where money talks, Saylor is clearly translating it. Saylor first got into Bitcoin when he milked $30 million from Block.one, the company co-founded by BitShares and EOS ‚Äòmastermind‚Äô Dan Larimer, for the Voice.com domain in 2019 ‚Äî the most expensive domain of all time. The site has done practically nothing for Larimer and Block.one in the four years since. That deal ‚Äî which apparently cottoned Saylor onto the value-generating potential of Bitcoin ‚Äî was an impressive feat that deserves praise. The fact that Saylor‚Äôs now up on $1 billion in Bitcoin is a bonus (although the actual profit is lower, as the firm must pay out its corporate bonds sold to buy BTC). Granted, Saylor has at times peddled suspicious advice, even at the top of bull markets (sell everything you own and mortgage your house to buy bitcoin). But all cryptocurrencies have their own brand of propaganda. Ethereum is a public good, Solana isn‚Äôt centralized, Cardano is peer-reviewed, banks will adopt XRP and Tether is fully backed. Depending on who you ask, those beliefs are shared fantasies, and at worst, folie √† deux.  Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have spokespeople like most of Web3. There‚Äôs no PR department, communications folk or marketing gurus. But there‚Äôs still magazines, conferences and global initiatives ‚Äî and even a mascot in Saylor.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More For many equity investors, Michael Saylor may not be a household name. But for crypto investors, Michael Saylor is legendary for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC -0.19%), as well as for some of his more outlandish takes on social media about the future of crypto. His company, MicroStrategy (MSTR -4.75%), is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and it's not even close. After buying an additional $615 million worth of Bitcoin at the end of 2023, his company now owns close to 1% of all Bitcoin in the world. Even more remarkably, MicroStrategy only started buying Bitcoin back in 2020, more than a decade after Bitcoin originally launched. But in the past three-plus years, Saylor and his company have consistently added to their Bitcoin position, through a variety of different market conditions. So what's behind this push to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can? As Saylor has reiterated over and over again, Bitcoin is the single best store of value over the long haul -- even better than gold. In fact, Saylor has even opined that the market cap of Bitcoin (now just under $1 trillion) could one day approach the market cap of physical gold, which is estimated to be around $13 trillion. There are several reasons for this admittedly audacious point of view. One is that Bitcoin has a limited lifetime supply. According to the algorithm powering Bitcoin, the total lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at just 21 million coins. The current circulating supply is close to 19.5 million coins, so we are getting close to the point where all the Bitcoin that will ever be created has already been created. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As Bitcoin adoption surges on a global scale, it will increase its relative scarcity. More people will be vying to gain access to a very limited supply, and over time, that is going to boost the price of Bitcoin. It's just basic economics. With supply largely unchanged, and demand going through the roof, the price of Bitcoin should soar. Moreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it attractive for another reason: It is arguably the single-best hedge against inflation over the long term. While gold investors may find this point highly debatable, the underlying logic does make a certain amount of sense, especially when you compare Bitcoin to fiat currency (i.e., currency controlled by governments and central banks, such as the U.S. dollar). This is due to the fact that an algorithm carefully controls the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. In fact, every four years, Bitcoin actually becomes more deflationary when the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half (i.e., ""the halving""). In contrast, a central bank can (theoretically) print as much money as it wants, which is what can lead to inflation and even hyperinflation. Putting this all together, I think there are several lessons for the average investor. Perhaps the most important lesson is the need for a long-term outlook. As Saylor has pointed out over and over again, his Bitcoin strategy is not a short-term trading strategy. This is all about buying Bitcoin for the long haul, and letting the market do its magic. Another key lesson is the need to stick to a buy-and-hold strategy, through a variety of different market conditions. Yes, MicroStrategy started accumulating Bitcoin during the last bull market rally, at a time when Bitcoin was skyrocketing to an all-time high of $69,000. But the company was not afraid to add to its position during the crypto market downturn, and Saylor now looks like a market savant, with Bitcoin poised for its next major market rally. Finally, it's never too late to invest in an asset if you truly believe in its long-term potential for price appreciation. Saylor and MicroStrategy regularly update the public on just how much Bitcoin they own, as well as the average purchase cost of each Bitcoin. Remarkably, the average cost of a single Bitcoin for Saylor at the end of November was $30,252. In essence, that means he completely missed out on the period of time (an entire decade!) in which Bitcoin surged from $1 to $30,000. So, no, it's not too late to invest in Bitcoin. It's easy to understand why Saylor is so unabashedly bullish on Bitcoin. But before you rush out and buy Bitcoin, make sure you fully understand the reason why Saylor is buying Bitcoin hand over fist. It's not just because Bitcoin is soaring in price -- it's because Bitcoin has certain inherent properties that make it valuable over the long haul. Despite the risk and volatility of crypto, the long-term outlook certainly seems bullish for Bitcoin. When Saylor recently appeared on CNBC, he suggested that Bitcoin had the potential to increase in value by 10x. At its current price of $44,000, a 10x valuation multiple means that a single Bitcoin could theoretically one day be worth close to half a million dollars. Own just two Bitcoins, and you could one day become a millionaire. Dominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin.

;;Michael Saylor Interview - Bitcoin for Corporations, Elon Musk, Tether, & Building Wealth With BTC;"Michael Saylor is the CEO and Co-founder of MicroStrategy. Michael has over purchased over 17,000 Bitcoins and MicroStrategy has over 70,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet. Michael tells us about his background, how he got into Bitcoin, his conversation with Elon Musk, Bitcoin FUD around Tether, Quantum Computing, and Crypto regulations. Michael also talks about the Bitcoin for Corporations initiative on February 3rd and 4th. https://www.michael.com/ , https://twitter.com/michael_saylor , https://www.microstrategy.com/en , https://www.saylor.org/ ,https://hope.com  Listen to the Podcast audio Tony: Hi everyone! Welcome back to the Thinking Crypto channel. I have a very very special guest with me Michael Saylor, who‚Äôs the co-founder and CEO MicroStrategy. Michael, I‚Äôm super excited to speak to you. Thank you for joining us today. Michael: Thanks for having me Tony. Tony: Before we get into Bitcoin, there‚Äôs a lot to go through there. I want to get a quick rundown on your background. Where did you grow up? Where‚Äôd you go to school? Michael: I grew up in an Air Force family and so I grew up on military bases all around the world. Japan, New Zealand, Colorado, Nebraska, Florida. Went to high school in Fairborn Ohio just outside of Dayton, birthplace of aviation. I lived on Wright-Patterson Air Force base. So, after I graduated from high school, I went to MIT. I spent four years in Cambridge Massachusetts. So, that‚Äôs where I was. Tony: Got it. What made you decide to start MicroStrategy? How did that come about? Michael: You know it was kind of unintentional, I wanted to get a PhD from MIT. And well actually what I really wanted to do is I wanted to be an astronaut. My senior year I was about to go off and fly jets and be an astronaut. And I was diagnosed with the benign heart murmur, that kept me from flying aircraft. It was mistake, 10 years later they realized I didn‚Äôt have it but they thought I had at the time. So, that lurched me in one direction, that took place with a few weeks to go before graduation. And I was going to go in the Air Force and the cold war was ending. The Air Force didn‚Äôt have space for us and they told us, we‚Äôd have to wait two or three years to get called up to active duty. So, they gave us the option to go in the Air Force reserve. As I was graduating from college, I went from 10 years as a pilot in the Air Force to now you‚Äôre not going the Air Force. I thought, ‚ÄòWell, I‚Äôll go to get a PhD.‚Äô But I‚Äôd missed all the deadlines for financial aid. So, I was catapulted into the working world at 22. I worked for about two years and I thought I‚Äôll work for a year; I‚Äôll apply for financial aid I‚Äôll go back and get my PhD. And at the end of the second year, I had everything lined up and I arranged the funding and I resigned from my job. I was building computer simulations for the DuPont corporation. And they wanted me to finish the computer model, because they were using it to acquire a billion dollars in capital funding. So, they begged me to stay. I didn‚Äôt want to stay. They offered me a raise. I didn‚Äôt want to raise. They said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll give you anything you want.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòWell, I wanted to be a rock star when I was in high school. I wanted to be an astronaut when I was in college. Now I want to be a professor. I get a PhD and there‚Äôs only one last thing on my list and the last thing on the list is be CEO. So, if you basically finance my company and let me start a company, then I‚Äôll stick around and do it.‚Äô So, I started MicroStrategy because my employer wanted me to finish a computer simulation and I didn‚Äôt think they would agree but they agreed. So, they ended up giving me the first few million dollars‚Äô worth of business and I started the company. I figured when it fails, I‚Äôll go back to college and get that PhD and it never failed. So, I‚Äôm still stuck here, so that‚Äôs how MicroStrategy came to be. Tony: So, for the five people who don‚Äôt know what MicroStrategy does and the services you provide, can you give us a quick overview? Michael: Sure, we‚Äôre an enterprise software company, so we sell software tools to about 5,000 large organizations like banks, big tech companies, government agencies, insurance companies. Most of the retailers in the world. They use that software in order to create custom analytic applications. Like I want to scan every item in every store every day and figure out whether my inventory is properly aligned with the demand I expect, or I want to review every account in a bank and figure out where the credit risk is too high or where I might have some exposure. So, they build these big complicated custom applications on proprietary databases and we sell them the tools and the servers necessary to run those applications and to just deploy them throughout their enterprise. It‚Äôs enterprise business intelligence, so that‚Äôs what MicroStrategy does. We do business about 27 countries most major cities in the world. We‚Äôre the largest publicly traded independent business intelligence company in the world. Tony: Wow. And you‚Äôve also have Sailor foundation and Sailor academy. Can you tell us about that initiative? Michael: Yeah, well the idea there is why can‚Äôt I get a mathematics degree for free, because I can in theory learn mathematics online. Or why can‚Äôt I get a computer science degree for free because all you need is computer. So, why is it gonna cost me 200,000 to get a computer science degree? So, I created the Sailor academy in order to make available free college education. And the idea is just make college education free to everybody in the world forever. We‚Äôve got engineering degrees, computer science degrees, math degrees, the like we‚Äôve educated about 800,000 students. We sign up 80,000 a quarter or more and it‚Äôs available to everybody on earth. You can go to ‚Äòsailor.org‚Äô and you can start any particular course. We have all the lectures all the textbooks are free. Tony: Wow. Michael: All the notes are free. The tests are online, they‚Äôre all certified with ACER. We try to get college credit and we have cross accreditations with a lot of universities. So, you might take two or three or four semesters worth of classes and then transfer the credit and finish up somewhere. Or if you started somewhere and you didn‚Äôt quite finish you need three more classes to get your degree. You could take those online and get the degree. The ideas make it quick and easy and cheap for anybody to learn. Tony: So, you‚Äôre certainly ahead of the curve there because we currently have at least in the United States and possibly globally too. The student loan bubble and even just the education bubble where it‚Äôs more about money versus quality of service and education. Are you know is the foundation itself like trying to work with possible government officials to help make education more accessible to folks? Michael: Yeah, we negotiate lots and lots of cross accreditations and partnerships with all sorts of universities and colleges everywhere in the world. In order to help their students or give them an on-ramp to students or if they have students that left and 10 years later, they want to continue that education they can. I think that we‚Äôll continue with that. We expect that the Sailor academy will become the Sailor university in the next few years, and it‚Äôll be fully degree granting itself. Right now, we have to give the credits through other universities. So, I think working with various institutions and regulators is a good thing in order to make that education more available. Tony: Sure. So, final item on your background you have written a book called The Mobile Wave, how mobile intelligence will change everything. Can you tell us about that? Certainly, I‚Äôve given it a read and given I‚Äôm in the digital marketing space it‚Äôs been very relevant with the transition to mobile away from desktop, to give us a quick overview of that book if you can. Michael: Well, you know one of my degrees at MIT was the history of science. So, I was always interested in scientific paradigm shifts. And they‚Äôre up until that point, I mean the first computer paradigm was mainframes and the people used software on mainframes in the back office. Then they went to many computers and moved into departments. And then when I got started in business it was the pc and all the software was running on desktops. There were entirely new companies created, you know the spreadsheet companies Microsoft for the PC. And then around 2000 the internet era hit. I mean from 94 to 2000 and companies like eBay and Amazon, Yahoo and Google became possible. That was the internet wave. Well, by 2009 with the iPhone 3, it became clear that iOS and android were going to be a new paradigm for software. And that instead of deploying software just on the internet or on a PC, we would actually embed software into devices that we wore around and carried in our pockets and slept with. That‚Äôs the fifth wave of computing, what I call the mobile wave. And I was fascinated by it and so I wrote this book about what happens when software moves from solid state to vapor state, what happens if software is all around us 24/7, 365. Because people that use software before the mobile wave were white collar workers two hours a day in the office. And after the mobile wave, three-year-old would be using the software, 80-year olds are using the software on the week and in the evening. So, you had just a massive explosion in software to different constituencies to different use cases. And now it became pretty clear that maybe software would replace money or software would, you know you would have the future of Facebook mobile apps and software to replace your telephone and software to replace your camera. And the implications were Amazon, Apple, Facebook. Google, the mega dominant digital networks. So, the mobile wave is all about what happens when things get de-materialized the software and what are the implications for society and business and the way that we live. Tony: Got it. I think you were certainly ahead of the curve on that one as well and it seems and we‚Äôre gonna segue now to Bitcoin. You are the head of the curve with the monetary system and money being on the internet. When did you first learn and come across Bitcoin? Michael: You know i probably heard about it in a 2012, 2013-time frame. I famously tweeted about it I thought it was like going, you know I thought maybe the regulars would shut it down. It was I didn‚Äôt have a strong conviction on it and then I kind of saw it flicker in the side of my eye for the next seven or eight years. But I was much more interested either in enterprise software because it‚Äôs my core business or I was interested in what was going on with Amazon and Apple and Facebook. Because I was a big investor in those and I‚Äôd written the Mobile Wave and I wasn‚Äôt really thinking about the monetary network. I had very clear ideas about the dominance of Google as an information network, Facebook is a social network, Apple is a mobile network you know and Amazon is a retail network. That was very clear to me. The monetary network not so clear to me, that I didn‚Äôt really become super interested in Bitcoin until march of the of 2020. Tony: Wow. What was the aha moment? Was there you took some time to study it again? Was it like, okay I missed this last time? Michael: I think that 2020 catalyzed tremendous change in a number of ways. I would say that 2020 is a year we went into the virtual wave. You know the Mobile Wave kicked off around 2010 and 10 years later now we‚Äôre going to virtual wave. And the virtual wave is epitomized by two massive changes. One on the operational P&L side is the explosion of Zoom and remote marketing, remote work, remote meetings. The explosion of YouTube is a way to get your message out and the virtualization of sales marketing services and communication. You know we saw Zoom go from 10 million users to 400 million users or something. You could just say a decade of progress in a few weeks, in 12 weeks you had had 12 years of advance. I think on the balance sheet side and on the money side, you saw the virtualization of gold. You saw the virtualization of money and the biggest manifestation of that is Bitcoin. This idea that maybe it‚Äôs time for a virtual digital monetary network. So, I think the catalyst was the pandemic and the lockdowns and the fight the monetary response to the pandemic. Tony: Sure. Michael: Because we just had an explosion in the monetary supply the M2 money supply and we had a K-shape recovery. And that K-shape recovery with a massively quick response and recovery and financial assets. But a very slow recovery of main street operations, caused a lot of people to stop and reconsider what they understood about money. And I would say 2020 ushered in the need for you know and the explosion of a digital monetary network, which is what Bitcoin is. Tony: Absolutely. So, you personally hold Bitcoin and you have Bitcoin on MicroStrategy‚Äôs balance sheet. What occurred first? I‚Äôm assuming you putting Bitcoin into your personal portfolio, correct? Michael: Yeah, I bought Bitcoin first and then the company followed. Tony: Now in presenting that to the board and the folks there, was their pushback where they‚Äôre like Michael what are you talking about, are you crazy? Michael: You know I mean it was up to me and it was just up to me then we would have just went and bought 500 million dollars‚Äô worth of Bitcoin as fast as we could. But you know when you‚Äôre a public company officer, you‚Äôre a fiduciary and you have to consider how you communicate this in a responsible fashion to all the outside shareholders and all the other constituents that are involved. So, we went through pretty extensive deliberations and I explained to the board my thoughts and obviously I told him that I had acquired Bitcoin myself. So, they need to understand my situation. Then after that we considered as a team the regulatory issues, the financial issues, the risk issues, the other macroeconomic options. That was eight weeks. I mean a pretty decent amount of deliberation. A lot of one-on-one meetings, a lot of group meetings, a lot of research. Work that the accountants did. Work that the lawyers did, work that the officers did, work that the board did. And after went through all that work, we actually arrived at a measured strategy. The strategy was you know multi-pronged, first we announced to the entire marketplace that we‚Äôre going to pursue a strategy of a combination of stock buybacks and asset investments in order to protect the balance sheet. So, we made that known because we wanted everybody that was an existing shareholder know that we had concerns about inflation. And we felt that we needed to do something. The two obvious answers are either you invest all the treasury with 500 million dollars. You either invest in the stock, you buy all the stock back or you invest it in an inflation hedge. So, there‚Äôs no magic, there‚Äôs no perfect answer. So, we just concluded, well we‚Äôll just do some of both. We split it down the middle, we said 250 million dollars earmarked for stock buyback, 250 million dollars earmarked for the inflation investment. After the market digested that, we moved forward with the strategy and we said, ‚ÄòOkay, well we thought about it we and we looked at every single asset.‚Äô What we wanted was, a safe haven treasury reserve asset that was going to appreciate faster than the rate of monetary expansion. So, we looked at real estate, we looked at bonds, we looked at stocks. None of those things work because they‚Äôre all fiat instruments and they‚Äôre valued based on the cash flows. And if the money supply expands and the basis the cash flows are going to debase as well. So, then we went to precious metals gold and silver and the truth is that was the best idea a hundred years ago. But there‚Äôs a better idea which is digital gold. Digital gold is everything you love about gold and everything you do and nothing that you hate about gold. So, it‚Äôs like pure pharmaceutical grade gold. And then we looked at every other crypto and figured out what‚Äôs the dominant network that‚Äôs most likely to get the lion‚Äôs share of support from other investors with similar interest to us. The conclusion was Bitcoin, because of a commitment to proof-of-work. And if you decide what you want is a proof-of-work crypto network, well then then Bitcoin is the largest. The issue is you got to pass over Ethereum, because Ethereum‚Äôs transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. And if you‚Äôre gonna actually put a billion dollars on the network, you have to have three to five years of experience of a stable network. So, I asked me five year after Ethereum 2.0 comes out how I feel about it and I‚Äôll have an opinion. But right now, I can‚Äôt as a fiduciary bet on something that‚Äôs about to go through a massive architectural change. So, then you go to the next thing which is Bitcoin cash and Satoshi vision and they‚Äôre all like 50, 60, 70 times smaller. So, really there wasn‚Äôt, I mean there wasn‚Äôt another crypto that was looking like a store of value proof of work you know network that would be a treasury reserve. And that‚Äôs why Bitcoin was the straightforward. The next closest thing is gold and gold just isn‚Äôt that close to thing, right. So, we went ahead and we allocated all 250 million dollars to Bitcoin. And then we announced a tender offer to buy back 250 million dollars‚Äô worth of the stock at a premium. It was a Dutch auction. So, the investors if they didn‚Äôt really approve of the Bitcoin strategy, because it‚Äôs new and maybe people just don‚Äôt, right. We wanted to give them a respectful way to exit out of profit. We tendered our profit and then we waited through the tinder period. And at the end of the period we had about 60 million dollars tendered. So, it could have been as much as 250, but it wasn‚Äôt that much. Most of the shareholders liked the idea. I mean they stuck with us and the stock traded above the tender offer price within a couple of days once people digested it. So, then we bought back the 60 million worth of stock and we had 175 million extras. We modified our treasury policy, we announced to the world that now we weren‚Äôt going to be limited to 250 million. Once they digested that we bought some more Bitcoin and then we put that on the wire. So, then we had 425 million worth of Bitcoin. And you know the stock traded up and Bitcoin traded up and eventually we had a billion worth of Bitcoin. Then we went to the market and we raised 650 million in debt, and we bought more Bitcoin and you know the stock traded up and Bitcoin traded up again. So, now we have a lot of Bitcoin, and the bondholders have their bond and the stockholders have their stock. And everybody that didn‚Äôt like the idea, isn‚Äôt a stockholder anymore and the people that like the idea are. So, we kind of rotated the shareholder base. As you can see it‚Äôs a long-winded answer to your question, because you can‚Äôt just do it in one move. You have to methodically move through a set of steps in order to make sure that there are no surprises along the way. Because everyone deserves to be communicated to. Tony: Absolutely, and I appreciate you taking us behind the curtain. It sounds like you did your due diligence there you looked at different options even outside of crypto. So, that‚Äôs really great. What do you think about the likes of a city group where they heard about the debt raise and using the respective funds towards Bitcoin? They lowered your you know the anticipation of your stock price. What do you think about that? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre getting challenge and pushback from a lot of mainstream folks. I‚Äôve seen your other interviews on TV. How are you handling that and you know it‚Äôs you‚Äôre going against the grain for as a publicly traded company? Michael: You know I think that some people understand Bitcoin and they understand the opportunity and they understand and accept the risk. They willingly invest in it, either they buy Bitcoin or they buy a fund or they buy companies that are in the business and they‚Äôre happy with it. And as long as you know in the public market, a publicly traded company can pursue a variety of strategies. The most important thing to do is to properly disclose what your strategy is, what the risks are to the best of your knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, we explain to everybody what we are. We‚Äôre an enterprise software company, selling business intelligence software everywhere in the world and there‚Äôs a whole set of risks this long. They take 25 pages. Then we disclose our treasury strategy. If we were going to invest in SP 500 indexes or we were going to invest in 30-year bonds or we‚Äôre going to invest in real estate in Texas or if we‚Äôre going to hold it in cash or we‚Äôre going to hold it in euros. These are all just different disclosures and risks. And so, we disclose that and there are some people that like that. I mean clearly there are people that bought the stock. I mean today it trades it right now it‚Äôs like trading four times what it was when we started. So, there are people that bought it and they‚Äôre happy with it and then there are some people that would say, ‚ÄòWell, this is not what I signed up for.‚Äô So, it‚Äôs important for us to let them know that, if you don‚Äôt want this you shouldn‚Äôt buy this stock, right. Tony: Sure. Michael: This is not your thing. So, I think some analysts don‚Äôt like to they don‚Äôt want to cover Bitcoin and it‚Äôs their right. They can do what they like, right. I mean so I don‚Äôt have a comment on that decision other than there are some investors that are delighted that we did it. There are other investors that sold back to us in the tender offer, because they didn‚Äôt want to be holding the stock. I respect both those decisions, that‚Äôs the right people make in the public market. Tony: Sure, and that‚Äôs great that you guys disclosed all that you were transparent and doing right by the shareholders. I would like to ask, how much Bitcoin do you personally own and how much does MicroStrategy have on its balance sheet? I know you‚Äôve done multiple accumulations, so I‚Äôm curious how much you have as far as a number. Michael: I think I have 17,732 Bitcoin. Tony: Got it. Michael: Me personally, I huddle that is mine. Then the company has something like 70,400. I put it on Twitter, about 70,000, the company. Tony: How did you personally and with the company execute their respective trades and how are you custodying it to keep it secure? Michael: You know I can‚Äôt tell you all my secrets. I can say the way you would do it is; you go through a due diligence process and you look at all of the institutional grade exchanges and custodians. MicroStrategy is actually sponsoring a Bitcoin for corporation summit coming up February 3rd and February 4th. We‚Äôve actually got a two-day course where we explain all of the nuances, all the things we think about with regard to acquisition, accounting, tax, due diligence, risk controls. I‚Äôve also got 10 different institutional grade Bitcoin vendors that have either Bitcoin funds or Bitcoin exchange services or brokerage services or Bitcoin custody services. And they all have strengths and weaknesses and they have specialties. The idea is everybody can go and look at those and decide for themselves. So, I went through that due diligence process. The company went through a due diligence process. We picked vendors that we were comfortable with for the acquisition and for the custody and that‚Äôs what we work with. Tony: Got it. So, Bitcoin for corporations you mentioned February 3rd and February 4th. So, along those lines since MicroStrategy made the move, have you had other CEOs calling up saying, ‚ÄòHey Michael, tell me about what you did‚Äô? Have other folks, publicly traded company folks approached you? Michael: Yeah, I have people that talk to me and they‚Äôre always very interested. I would say that I get a lot more inquiries now than I did six months ago. I mean Bitcoin is becoming a very interesting topic. So, I think a lot of companies are interested in this. Private companies, public companies, high net worth individuals and also institutional investors. So, I‚Äôve had my fair share of conversations. Tony: You know I have to ask Michael the conversation with Elon on Twitter. How did the offline conversation go? Did you share your plan with him? Was he receptive? I know you probably can‚Äôt say, well yes, he did this, but as much as you can give us. Michael: You know everybody asked me this question, it‚Äôs very popular question. I wish I could help you with an answer to that question but unfortunately, I cannot help. But it is an interesting question. Tony: I should say, okay this is as far as I‚Äôll go. Did you have a conversation with him offline? Michael: You know I wish I could help you with that question. I had a conversation with him online, I tell you what I said which I would say to everybody. Which is I think that a company that‚Äôs got a lot of cash would do well to convert some of that cash if not a lot of that cash, if not all of that cash to Bitcoin. Because if you have cash on your balance sheet, it‚Äôs debasing it 10 to 15% a year. It‚Äôs a liability and over 10 years you‚Äôre going to lose 75% of your purchasing power. And on the other hand, if you flip it into Bitcoin it‚Äôs an accretive asset and Bitcoin‚Äôs been going up 200% a year. But if it was going up 20% a year, you would end up doubling it. You know like every three years and you would double it three times. So, you go from a billion to two billion to four billion to eight billion. It makes sense for companies to convert their balance sheet from liabilities to assets. And the right way to do that is by embracing Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Tony: Sure. I heard you mention on TV that look Apple and Google may be on the way. Do you feel 2021 is gonna be the year of this trend that I think that you started, I‚Äôve interviewed some medium and small businesses who are doing the same? What do you think? Do you think this is the year given that look they‚Äôre gonna print more money it‚Äôs coming, right? Michael: Yeah, I think you‚Äôre going to see a lot more companies putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing this conference, because there‚Äôs a lot of demand. I‚Äôve got thousands of customers and a lot of them are coming out of the woodwork asking, how do you do this help us you know work through the playbook, the regulatory issues the due diligence issues the acquisition the custody. All these things make it easy for us. So, it‚Äôs really popular demand right now. I think that it wasn‚Äôt on corporations‚Äô radars in 2020, in March people were shaken. After we did it in August people started noticing. I think that a lot of early movers you know and people like square right, for example they started moving. And Stone Ridge, a lot of private companies and I‚Äôve talked to they‚Äôve already moved. You can see that, but you know for the next tranche of public companies I think you start to see them; they‚Äôll trickle out in 2021 and you‚Äôll see a bunch. But over the next 36 months it‚Äôll be a batch then a double triple batch then what they say gradually then suddenly. Then quite a lot, right. So, I just think you‚Äôre going to see this growing. I think you‚Äôll see, already you‚Äôll see high net worth individuals‚Äô institutions. The fast money crowd, you know how it works. The fast money investors on Wall Street, they‚Äôre going to front run the massive insurance companies the massive publicly traded companies. But they‚Äôre going to get in there a little bit earlier. So, I think you already see a lot of them like Ruffin, like Guggenheim, like Skybridge. They‚Äôre already moving. But you‚Äôll see a lot more of that and then you‚Äôll see some good announcements I think in 2021 from publicly traded companies. I think that that‚Äôs going to wake up more people and they‚Äôre going to realize something which is, Bitcoin‚Äôs a monetary network. It‚Äôs the first thermodynamically sound monetary network and why wouldn‚Äôt you want to plug into that thing if it turns your balance sheet into an asset instead of a liability. It‚Äôs like oxygen mask dropping out from the space above your seat in the airplane. I mean more and more companies are going to actually start to grab that oxygen mass because it just makes a lot of sense. Tony: Sure. And we‚Äôve also heard from Miami‚Äôs Mayor that he‚Äôs considering adding Bitcoin to the city‚Äôs treasury. Do you see central banks as well as local governments possibly federal governments around the world doing this? Michael: Eventually, I mean you know it starts with the visionaries and then it‚Äôs the early adopters and the high net worth and the family offices. Then it‚Äôll be the fast money and the hedge fund guys and then the private companies and then small nimble and committed public companies and then more public companies than every public company. I think that there‚Äôs definitely going to be a place for agencies. You‚Äôll see agencies, you‚Äôll see non-profits moving more aggressively. And eventually you‚Äôll see banks central banks, you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôll be the central banks of the smaller countries first, right. I mean the ones that if your currency is completely collapsed. And you‚Äôre thinking should we go with the gold standard or the Bitcoin standard or should we just use you know dollars or euros. It seems to me pretty clear that it makes sense to start to adopt a Bitcoin standard. I think that you know you should think of those as concentric layers, right. So, I think that the largest central banks will be last, but it seems an idea whose time has come it‚Äôs a force, it‚Äôs coming. It‚Äôs just going to keep building. Tony: Now I want to talk about the threats to Bitcoin, kind of if we were doing a swot analysis the strengths the weaknesses and so forth. So, the threats that are out there, people have written off Bitcoin thousands of times, but it‚Äôs still around. What do you think about the Tether situation as well as quantum computing? And if there‚Äôs some very strict regulations maybe coming from the United States which is largest capital economy or market if you want to call it that. Michael: There‚Äôs definitely a lot of fun in this industry. I‚Äôve never seen so much fun; I don‚Äôt know why. Like for example like people that buy a billion dollars of Apple stock don‚Äôt sit around saying is Tether manipulating at Apple stock price or is the quantum computer going to destroy the Apple network. There‚Äôs a lot of people in the crypto industry I think that are very creative that are coming up with these things. With regard to Tether, it‚Äôs completely irrelevant. I can‚Äôt even imagine why anybody would take it seriously. The people that are buying Bitcoin are wiring hundreds of millions of dollars of cash into an exchange and they‚Äôre buying Bitcoin. 500 million of money goes to some place, they buy 500 million of Bitcoin that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on. There are some people that wire you know some money into tether and they use tether instead of cash. Because they want to move it between Singapore Malta or some offshore exchange. But it‚Äôs really third order and what does it matter that someone uses Tether, right. I guess the theory is something like someone‚Äôs created an extra 20 billion dollars of Tether and bought Bitcoin with it and it‚Äôs not backed. But that means that they‚Äôre short the Tether and if someone ever calls it back, they‚Äôre going to come up with 20 billion dollars, they‚Äôre totally out of luck. I don‚Äôt believe that for a heartbeat. I think that that‚Äôs silly. So, I got some email and it just felt like it was a scammer. I feel like all the Tether Fudd is like some kind of scammer distributing something. But there‚Äôs no legitimate institutional buyer would even consider that and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve been using Tether, right. In the US, they‚Äôre not even using tether to buy Bitcoin and most of the demand for Bitcoin is coming from the US and just US dollars getting wired into exchanges to buy. Maybe you could help me with the theory or why anybody even thinks the Tether thing is relevant. Tony: Well, I think to your point that it‚Äôs not fully backed. There‚Äôs a certain investigation, but to your point it‚Äôs very minimal, it‚Äôs not like the Googing Heim fund is using Tether and mass mutual using Tether and so forth. Michael: Even if Tether goes to zero, what‚Äôs it got to do with Bitcoin it‚Äôs irrelevant. It‚Äôs like people that are buying Bitcoin are buying Bitcoin to hold for a decade and they‚Äôre using either euros or dollars or some other fiat currency. If it goes if it ever went through Tether is transitional for a day. And I‚Äôm gonna maybe I would wire some Tether into an offshore exchange to buy it. But it‚Äôs kind of like saying that you know like if I wire money from one bank to the other bank, it like sits there for 24 hours before it gets converted to Bitcoin. So, it‚Äôs completely irrelevant. It‚Äôs kind of like the Fudd of what if central banks created digital currency. Well, the answer is that doesn‚Äôt matter either. People aren‚Äôt buying Bitcoin in lieu of central bank currency; they‚Äôre not buying Bitcoin in lieu of Tether. And there‚Äôs not any genie behind the wall that can conjure up a hundred billion dollars and Tether and buy Bitcoin and not pay it back. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way. Tony: Sure. I think it‚Äôs kind of like what Rao Powell said. It‚Äôs both a bug and a feature of the crypto community, because if you‚Äôre invested in Bitcoin, you‚Äôre gonna want to see Bitcoin do well, right. There‚Äôre folks invested in Ethereum and others so they maybe try to put out a narrative out there to get people to be scared and sell their positions in Bitcoin and so forth. I think some of it is that, it takes your point of what‚Äôs spreading. Michael: Yeah. So, I think the Tether is kind of just irrelevant random irrational Fudd. What‚Äôs the next thing, quantum fears? Tony: Yeah. Michael: Okay, that‚Äôs the same thing. The only people that pitch that or other alt coiners that want to somehow say that they‚Äôre more quantum resistant. You think anybody that owns Amazon stock is dumping the stock because of quantum fears. Do you think anybody owning Google is, you think Sergey Brinner you know is concerned about his Google stock because of quantum computers? I never met anybody on the planet outside of people in the altcoin space that talk about quantum attacks and they talk about it all the time. My conclusion is they‚Äôre just desperately grasping at straws looking for some way to criticize Bitcoin. Because they think that they‚Äôve got a better quantum algorithm. But A, I think it‚Äôs if someone invented a quantum computer, 99.99% of all the stuff on earth is not in Bitcoin, and it‚Äôs all subject to quantum attack. I could pretty much create World War iii and end earth and life as you know it on the planet and take away anything from anybody if I have the mythical all-powerful quantum computer. Tony: Yeah. Michael: And first thing you‚Äôre gonna attack is probably like wouldn‚Äôt you just steal like a hundred trillion dollars‚Äô worth of bonds and sovereign debt. Why would you bother to go after the stuff in Bitcoin if you really had the all-powerful computer? So, it‚Äôs kind of a silly thought experiment, but like you really think a malefactor is going to get their own quantum computer. No one‚Äôs going to find out and that no one‚Äôs going to do anything about it. I really feel like it‚Äôs dudes in their garage that are making stuff up to try to sell you know the 6,437 crypto project and get funding for it. So, now I think that‚Äôs just as silly as the Tether Fudd. I think they‚Äôre both just random Fudd from altcoin projects. Tony: By the way, I agree with you. I think there‚Äôs folks who are listening who maybe now coming into Bitcoin and highlighting what about these things since they‚Äôre hearing them. So, I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre addressing them and to your point if there‚Äôs quantum computing. At least thing we should be or the last thing we should be worried about is Bitcoin. There‚Äôs just life itself and what could happen. Michael: Bitcoin is the most secure network on earth and the most secure database and it‚Äôs got now what 700 billion dollars 800 billion dollars of monetary energy in it. Some large amount, which means that it‚Äôs got more money and more incentive to cure the problem sooner than anybody else if there should be a problem. But again, it‚Äôs the real point is life on earth as we know it would be threatened by the all-powerful mythical factor with a quantum computer. And the first thing they‚Äôre going to attack is not going to be Bitcoin, right. But I just don‚Äôt, Dr Evil is not getting a quantum computer. And if Dr Evil gets it, then you know your Bitcoin is going to be the least of your worries. There are better things to focus your time on, it‚Äôs just a very creative way to get distracted. And it‚Äôll probably cost you a lot of money, because you have the world‚Äôs first thermodynamically sound monetary network. There‚Äôs no reason why it shouldn‚Äôt go up by a factor of a hundred and you‚Äôre not gonna invest in it or take advantage of it. Because of your fear that a thousand whatever years from now or a hundred or twenty or ten, Dr Evil will get a quantum computer. So, I would respond with you know the classic Bitcoiner response, have fun staying poor. Tony: But in the other threat so to speak, what if the government decides okay Bitcoin‚Äôs too much of a threat to us and our CDC‚Äôs and the IMF and Christine Lagarde, and all these folks come together. What if they come out with some strict regulations? I know that that‚Äôs going to be impossible with Bitcoin being a global monetary network, but I‚Äôm curious what your thoughts are there. Michael: I think that over the next decade the most logical challenge for people in the Bitcoin community is just regulatory fund. You‚Äôll just see fear uncertainty and doubt about, ‚ÄòWell, what if a regulator does something that‚Äôs bad, I don‚Äôt know what it is but what if they do. It just like you know what did Dr Evil invincible on a computer.‚Äô They‚Äôre just kind of I‚Äôm speculating that something might happen. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but what if something that I don‚Äôt know will be really bad that will cause a problem. And that‚Äôs why we should do nothing or that‚Äôs why you should give me money to invest in the 6,437 different projects. I think the answer is the regulators will regulate it, the IRS will make you pay tax on it. They have, its property paid property tax. If you want to use it a currency you can‚Äôt because there‚Äôs a capital gain tax when you transfer it. So, it is regulated. The OCC will have an opinion the SEC will have an opinion. You know the treasury will have an opinion. There are KYC regulations like for example it might take you four weeks to get an account with a regulated exchange. There‚Äôll be AML regulations. I think there‚Äôll be regulations everywhere in the world, but the writing is on the wall it‚Äôs most likely that what we‚Äôre going to see is it can be regulated as property. And that means that if you had $100,000 of cash in the bank and you wanted to wire it to a random phone number without saying or knowing who it is, probably the bank would bulk. If you have a 100,000 worth of Bitcoin and you want to wire it to a random place and it‚Äôs in a regulated custodian, they‚Äôll probably get around to saying the same. The same rules that apply to AML rules that apply to cash or to gold or to order a share of Apple stock will probably start to apply to Bitcoin. There‚Äôll be some evolution of that, maybe they‚Äôll be more flexible maybe they won‚Äôt. But at the end of the day, if your greatest fear is it gets regulated the same way other property is regulated. It‚Äôs not going to impair Bitcoin is a store of value. And in fact, Bitcoin is the best store of value on earth. It‚Äôs a better store of value than stocks. You can‚Äôt wire 10 million dollars of stocks to a private wallet in Africa right now. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that Amazon is worthless, right. It‚Äôs going to be a better store of value than real estate is going to be a better store of value than bonds. You can‚Äôt send a billion dollars‚Äô worth of sovereign debt to a private wallet, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the debt isn‚Äôt there, right. So, if Bitcoin is better store value than bonds, stocks, real estate, gold, silver and derivatives and every flavor of cash, then there‚Äôs no reason why it shouldn‚Äôt absorb 100 trillion dollars of monetary energy. Regardless of what if you apply all the regulations to it that you applied to all those things, I just named. Tony: Right. Michael: For example, if you had a 10-million-dollar ranch in California you probably couldn‚Äôt wire that to your friend in Africa to a private wallet without permission either, right. I mean the point, but does that make it worthless. Tony: No, Yeah. Michael: So, I think that the regulatory Fudd again is another example of it can be a debilitating paralytic type reaction. Where people paralyze themselves, they prevent themselves from doing something obvious and rational. Because they‚Äôre speculating about some parade of horrible that may or may not take place that are incoherent. They can‚Äôt quite articulate yet, but they‚Äôre sure they‚Äôre afraid of something that they haven‚Äôt quite been able to articulate. But let‚Äôs just say in the extreme case that Bitcoin is regulated the same way that $10,000 of cash is in the US. It‚Äôs still going to be a thousand times better than holding the cash. What are you gonna do, right? You‚Äôre gonna convert your Bitcoin back into cash, right. Like you can sell your Bitcoin right now. What are you going to convert it into that‚Äôs less regulated? Nothing right. Tony: Yeah. Michael: So, at the end of the day I think they‚Äôll be know your customer this, there will be anti-money laundering that there‚Äôll be some tax regulations. There‚Äôll be some back and forth over what you can do. There‚Äôll be concerns about privacy. That‚Äôs why I look at Bitcoin and I think it‚Äôs pretty clear if the use case is store of value, well like 7.8 billion people on earth need a store of value and then probably the value of that is 100 to 300 trillion dollars, right. That‚Äôs enough, that‚Äôs good. If the use case is currency replace the dollar and the euro, that seems like I mean that‚Äôs just intentionally inflammatory. We don‚Äôt need to replace the euro and the dollar. The bankers are going to be upset about replacing the zero in the dollar. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen not in the next decade or two decades. So, we don‚Äôt need to get wrapped around the axle on that. And if the use case is medium of exchange and payment, like we don‚Äôt really need to pay for a pizza with it we don‚Äôt need to pay for Starbucks coffee with it. I mean that‚Äôs already solved by Alibaba and PayPal and Square and Apple pay and Amazon and Google pay and it‚Äôs you know they can be regulated and Visa and Mastercard. So, you can leave these in Mastercard alone, you can leave the dollar in the euro alone. We can agree to pay taxes. We cannot thumb our nose at regulators and then we can focus upon the critical matter at hand. Which is everybody on earth needs a store of value. It‚Äôs not illegal to pursue a store of value. If you have $100,000 in cash and you‚Äôre looking at it being debased at 15 a year, because the expansion of the M2 money supply and fractional banking. Then your choice is: Are you going to buy bonds? Are you going to buy real estate? Are you going to buy Apple stock? Are you going to buy the Nasdaq index? Are you going to buy the Dow? Are you going to buy any index, the Russell 2000? Are you going to go buy gold? You‚Äôre going to go buy silver or you‚Äôre going to go buy Bitcoin? That‚Äôs your choice. Make a choice. Tony: Sure. Michael: If Bitcoin is an index, you know it becomes a thermodynamically sound monetary index and you compared that to the Dow, the SP and the Nasdaq. It would be a better index. It‚Äôs a deflationary index, right. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily replace currency with privacy with censorship resistance. Don‚Äôt get me wrong right, before I trigger everybody, I‚Äôm in favor of all those things. But you don‚Äôt have to achieve all those things in order to have a valuable a store of value crypto asset network. If Bitcoin is simply a store of value and is better than gold, there‚Äôs no reason why it shouldn‚Äôt go to 100 trillion dollars in value. And that‚Äôs what five million dollars a coin. So, I think that we‚Äôve got a very simple addressable market, a powerful one. It‚Äôs a hundred times bigger than Google or Facebook or Amazon or Apple. It‚Äôs a big thing. I think sometimes my issue with the Fudd is when you get all wrapped around the axle on, oh it‚Äôs quantum attacks and oh my god Tethers being manipulated or what about regulators. You focus on that; you miss the big picture. Guys, this is a big tech network which is a hundred times bigger than every other big tech network. It‚Äôs only gonna happen once in your life. This is it. You will never get a better chance actually to get a leg up in the world than to be early to the world‚Äôs first digital monetary network. And you‚Äôre gonna miss this opportunity, because you‚Äôre worrying and freaking out over all these third order fourth order fifth order hypothetical Fudd concerns. I think they‚Äôre just enormously distracting and expensive and people should focus upon the first order issue here. Tony: Sure. And I‚Äôm sure you know some of it is the people who are anti-Bitcoin who put a lot of those things out. Those who also possibly looking look it‚Äôs a market and a game of shorts and longs and shake people out and create different emotions and a psychological wall street cheat sheet so to speak. So, I‚Äôm sure some of that is part of it. I‚Äôm curious as far as your, I know this is a clich√© question price prediction for this year and maybe the next, by the time the next halving. Anything you can share in that front? Michael: I think people in the crypto community are too fixated upon short-term price movement. Like they‚Äôre studying which way it‚Äôs going to go every two days or every week or every month. You know I don‚Äôt subscribe to that; I don‚Äôt think anybody knows. And if you told me it was going to go one direction or the other in the next month it wouldn‚Äôt change any decision. If you told me three months it wouldn‚Äôt change a decision, if you told me a year it wouldn‚Äôt change my decision. I think that the rational way to think about this is to look out over, if you want to be near term and a conventional investor four years a 200-week moving average. And if you want to be a bit more fundamental investor then you look out a decade to two decades. So, when I think about it, I think what happens in a decade what happens in 100 years. Between 10 and 100 years I run all my models I work backwards, and I say what do I think in four years. But I never think about four weeks four days four hours, even four months, right. You could be wrong for four months, but if you‚Äôve worked out the fundamental physics of the thing and you‚Äôre looking at the bigger issues. Then you‚Äôll probably be right over four years. So, what is my prediction? My prediction is over time it will go up in price and I think it‚Äôll go up in price because I expected to demonetize gold and then demonetize negative yielding sovereign debt, then demonetizing low yielding debt. It‚Äôll demonetize other stores of value, like bond indexes, stock indexes, Russell 2000 indexes, mutual funds etc. Obviously, that‚Äôs a 100x more than it is right now. As for how fast you know like it was going up at 1,500% annualized yeah for a month. So, people are freaked out that it like you know it traces back. Well, when it traced back when it crashed it was only going up 1,000% annualized. Tony: Yeah. Michael: Okay, if it went up a 100% annualized, it would destroy every other alternative, right. So, the point really is whether it‚Äôs 1,500 or a 1,000% or a 100% or 200%, that‚Äôs going to be a really big deal for people staring at the chart over one two, four, eight-week time frames. But the only decision you can make which is a mistake right is to be short Bitcoin, right. Like to sell it and not own it when it goes up again is the one mistake, right. I mean, in fact so if you get up every day and you ask this question, ‚ÄòWell, should I sell it today?‚Äô Well, you can ask the question 365 days in a row and one day you‚Äôll make a mistake. If you get up every day and you don‚Äôt ask the question, are you committed. If you‚Äôre committed, then why don‚Äôt you just wait a year and then you can look and see what happened and maybe it went up and maybe it went down. And after four years, if it‚Äôs down it‚Äôs probably not working after four years. There‚Äôs something wrong with the thesis. After one year, I‚Äôve actually seen periods where like with Apple stock you know it was clear Apple‚Äôs going to crush everybody. There‚Äôs like a one-year period when you could have bought it and it would be down for the year over the past 10 years or 15 years. There was one time, you might have been saying. There was never a two-year period or a three-year period and over a four-year period. You could have bought Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft over four years. You know anytime during this mobile wave era. It‚Äôs impossible, this thing‚Äôs going Bitcoin is going faster than they‚Äôre going. I think the people that are real critics right they looked at the blow off talk in 2007 and they were like they were using that as a criticism. But even then, right over four years, it turns out that you would have it would have been a mistake to have sold ever. Tony: I‚Äôve heard you say, you‚Äôre never going to sell your Bitcoin. So, is there any situation that you would find yourself in that you‚Äôre like, you know what I‚Äôll sell some or are you like plan to leave it as an inheritance for your family, things like that? Michael: That‚Äôs right. Let me explain on that. Why would you ever sell an asset in an inflationary environment if it‚Äôs being priced in Fiat currency, which is collapsing in value? For example, if I told you that the dollar is going to be printed and it‚Äôs going to be debased 10% a year. And if you owned a house and it was a desirable house and you wanted to live there the rest of your life. Why would you ever sell the house? Because you know it‚Äôs going up in price 10% a year. And if the interest rate is 3%, you would just hold the house the rest your life and just refinance the house. And when you need more money, you would borrow against the house because the house is going up. If you owned a football team and I printed 10% more money the value of the football team would go up, you‚Äôre not going to sell the football team you‚Äôre going to hold it. If you need money, you‚Äôre going to borrow against it. Selling something, selling a good asset normally is always a mistake. But Warren Buffett‚Äôs never sold his assets, he held him forever. John Malone held his assets, pretty much every billionaire that you know of for the past hundred years, they got that way by never selling anything, right. So, the trick is you have to find an asset which is not going to be impaired, right. The reason to sell something is not because you need money. The reason to sell something is because the asset is impaired. And by impaired, I mean like sell the football team because you know no one will ever watch football ever again or sell the ranch in California, because you know that they‚Äôre gonna pass a 5% of your property tax on California. You need to leave California and no one‚Äôs going to want to go to that ranch. And sell it, because it‚Äôs impaired. If it‚Äôs not impaired, then as fiat gets printed the asset is going to go up in value if it‚Äôs a high-quality asset. And if you were to sell it you would get hit with the capital gains tax either long term or short term, right. Tony: Yep. Michael: Capital gains tax is likely to go up next year, right. I mean it‚Äôs 25 to 50% depending on where you‚Äôre living. So, you sell something you‚Äôre going to pay half of it to the federal government or the state government you keep the other half and then you‚Äôre going to lose the appreciation on the asset. If Bitcoin was going up 20% a year right, and you sold it you would lose a 20 return every year for a decade. That means selling a million dollars a Bitcoin will cost you 10 million dollars in 10 years. So, you lose the capital appreciation, you pay the tax, you get half a million dollars to spend. Why wouldn‚Äôt you just borrow half a million dollars? Tony: So, you‚Äôre saying borrow against your Bitcoin holdings. It in a way to earn. Okay, so like kind of like block fi, I use block fi lend and earn interest on my Bitcoin and other cryptos in that type of scenario. Michael: Let me make a big point, right. If the asset is appreciating faster in value than the rate at which your expenses are going up yearly. You can borrow against it forever and your debt to equity ratio will fall. You see like if I had a million dollars of Bitcoin, I borrowed 100,000 again, so my debt to equity ratio would be 10%. I would pay maybe I pay 5% interest, maybe I pay obscene interest 10% interest. so, it cost me a 110,000 instead of a 100,000. Okay, well Bitcoins going up fill in the number. What do you want to fill in? 20%, it‚Äôs going up 200%, right. If it was going up 100% by the way your 1 million becomes 2 million, next year you have 2 million. You borrow another 100,000, now you‚Äôve got $200,000 in debt outstanding. You‚Äôve got you know 30,000 in accumulated interest; you‚Äôve got $200,000 dollars against two million dollars. You know your debt to equity ratio is no worse, you know the next year it doubles again. And now you‚Äôve got four million against three 300,000 in debt. Your debt to equity ratio falls, the next year it doubles again. Now you got 500,000 in debt against 8 million your debt decree equity ratio falls to 6%. You know your debt to equity ratio will fall and exponentially to zero, right. I mean well not the zero but to a low number. So, if you actually wanted to accumulate wealth, the number one thing you got to do is you have to acquire high quality assets that will not be impaired. The number two thing you have to do is you have to have relationship with banks that will advance you money, cash, fiat, euros, dollars that you have to spend against those assets. That‚Äôs the second thing, but the first thing. Well, now let‚Äôs come back to Bitcoin. What‚Äôs the highest quality asset and on earth? What‚Äôs the best property you could possibly have? A city block in Manhattan, not anymore. It used to be a city block in Manhattan when everybody in the world went to New York city. But you can‚Äôt move a city block. What if I gave you know all of park avenue and cyberspace and I told you that a billion people are going to live there one day and they‚Äôll live there for a thousand years? What if 10 billion people want to live in cyberspace for a thousand years and you could actually own 1% of the city or 0.1% of the city? Why would you ever sell it? Tony: Right. Michael: I mean the point is they‚Äôre not making any more of it. Bitcoin is Manhattan in cyberspace. It‚Äôs 21 million city blocks. You can buy a block. It‚Äôs better than buying all of LA, because you can‚Äôt move LA out of California, you can‚Äôt move it out of the US. It‚Äôs better than buying 10 of Apple because Apple might twice as many shares and they only have 5% of Apple. It‚Äôs better than owning a bunch of gold, because gold miners are going to produce twice as much gold. Okay, it‚Äôs better than owning bonds and cash. So, tell me what on earth is better than owning the jets or a football team? People might not be watching football in a thousand years. There‚Äôs nobody in the stands this year watching football, right. So, find an asset, it‚Äôs probably better than owning the Mona Lisa or owning a Michelangelo or something like that. I mean all those are scarce. Tony: Right, it scares. Michael: You can‚Äôt be guaranteed that everybody‚Äôs going to want to have classical art, but will everybody want money, monetary energy. Like monetary energy is the ultimate property I have pure encrypted tokenized monetary energy and I can own 121 millionth of all the monetary energy. There‚Äôs ever going to be for people on the monetary network, which is the dominant monetary network. So, you buying that fill in the number you buy it and it‚Äôs going up a 100% a year, right. You have a million dollars and you sell it, so you have half a million dollars you can spend or you don‚Äôt sell it and it goes to 2 million, 4 million, 8 million, 16 million, 32 million, 64 million, 128 million, 256 million, 512 million, a billion. Okay, so a millionaire becomes a billionaire by not selling over 10 years. Let‚Äôs say you wanted to spend 500,000 a year, borrow 500,000 a year and after 10 years you will owe 5 million out of a billion. Your debt to equity including interest is less than 1%. 1% of your Bitcoin would be debt. Now you tell me, you think it‚Äôs a wise thing to sell the million dollars. It‚Äôs gonna cost you 999 million dollars to sell the million. You think it‚Äôs less risky. And I think the answer is I think people they‚Äôre not realizing that they can borrow against it. They should go and the single most important thing you can do is develop relationships with bankers that will loan you money against your assets. And then in terms of Tony like what would I borrow. Well, first you borrow against fixed assets like borrow against your house, because it‚Äôs not marked a market. No one‚Äôs going to, it‚Äôs not going to trade down by 50% in the morning, right. So, I joke you know mortgage your house by Bitcoin. But the truth is before I sold Bitcoin, I would mortgage my house. Because I can get a 30-year mortgage with a fixed interest rate and the house is probably going to go up in value over the 30 years. Because the banks are going to print more money. So, why don‚Äôt you borrow against a fixed asset, if I can‚Äôt bar against a house I borrow against my car. Okay, I started MicroStrategy I took a furniture loan. I borrowed money for furniture. I didn‚Äôt buy the furniture by the way; it was just an excuse to get an unsecured loan. But you know you borrow against something like that, that is not gonna trade down rapidly. For example, I would not tell anybody go buy Bitcoin on 10 to 1 margin. Like that‚Äôs stupid, like don‚Äôt go buy a million dollars of Bitcoin with a hundred thousand of collateral. Because if it trades down 10%, you‚Äôre going to get force liquidated and wiped out and lose your 100,000. I would say a better idea would be buy a 100,000 of Bitcoin with a 100,000 in collateral. And when it goes up by a factor of three or four, you can borrow $50,000 against it. Your debt to equity ratio would be 20%. If it doubles the next year, your debt equity ratio will be 10%. If it doubles again, your debt to equity ratio will be 5%. If it doesn‚Äôt go up by a factor of 100% it goes up by 10, as long as it‚Äôs appreciating faster than your rate of interest and interest rates are low. It‚Äôs kind of a non-issue.  You have to adjust your expenditures right to keep them in line. So, common sense is you know keep your debt to equity ratio at 10, 20, 30 of your assets and then hold on to high quality assets. There is no one that ever got rich in my opinion, nearly no one that didn‚Äôt buy an asset and let it appreciate tax free over time. It‚Äôs the taxes that kill you, right. The capital gain tax, the income tax etc. And when you borrow against assets, you‚Äôre actually living on liability. So, right instead of making $525,000 a year and then paying 250,000 a year in taxes, wouldn‚Äôt it be a lot smarter to borrow 250,000 a year. Let the money appreciate tax free for the next 20 years of your life. That way you pay no tax and you‚Äôve still got an asset that‚Äôs working for you. So, you win both ways. You just have to manage your debt exposure and you have to be intelligent about are you marking the asset to market. And if you‚Äôre marking it to market, you need to be very conservative about your debt-to-equity ratio. As opposed to are you taking an asset against a loan against a fixed asset which isn‚Äôt going to be marked the market is just the term loan. Tony: So, Michael I know you have a few more minutes, because you mentioned you had to hop off at a certain time. Two quick questions before we wrap it up. Is MicroStrategy planning to get into any Bitcoin mining? We‚Äôre seeing a Bitcoin mining movement in the United States. Anything there that you‚Äôre planning to do? Michael: You know I think it‚Äôs important that the Bitcoin mining industry grow everywhere in the world and especially in the US. I‚Äôm a big fan of that, I like it. I think that the people that should be in Bitcoin mining, they need to have proprietary assets either in energy. But you need to have access to cheap energy over a long time. And/or they need to have a capital structure optimized. If you‚Äôre a publicly traded company, that‚Äôs got shareholders that want to be in the mining business. Like say Marathon, it makes sense for them because that‚Äôs what they are, right. Their shareholders signed up for that and they‚Äôve got a capital structure for that. So, if you have a public company that‚Äôs optimized for that, that‚Äôs good. And then if you have access to, if you‚Äôre I mean Intel ought to get into it, right. If you can manufacture semiconductors or if you‚Äôve got data centers like Amazon. The real the ideal thing would be an Intel or an Amazon, someone that‚Äôs actually got serious data center structures. Because they have strategic assets there. MicroStrategy really isn‚Äôt strategically in the data center business the chip business or the energy business, so it‚Äôs not really a good fit for us. But it would be a good fit for one of those types of companies. Tony: Got it. Final question is rapid fire. Favorite food? Michael: Steak. Tony: Favorite musician or band? Michael: Sting. Tony: Sting, nice. Favorite movie? Michael: The Godfather. Tony: Nice. What‚Äôs your favorite book? Michael: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Tony: And when you‚Äôre not at MicroStrategy or you know looking at Bitcoin, what are you doing for fun as a hobby? Michael: I‚Äôm floating somewhere in the watery part of the world. Tony: Very cool. Michael I‚Äôve learned so much today, it‚Äôs a pleasure to chatting with you. Thank you so much for joining us. Michael: Thanks for having me Tony I appreciate it.

;;After Breaking All-Time High, Is Bitget‚Äôs BGB Token Poised for More Growth in 2024?;0 0 The recent flurry of spot bitcoin ETF approvals has caused a groundswell of optimism in the wider cryptocurrency market, which briefly surpassed the momentous $2 trillion market cap milestone last week. Naturally, a range of blockchain projects and digital tokens have risen in value as a consequence of Bitcoin‚Äôs success, with the feel-good factor spreading outward. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all. That being said, bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory is no guarantee that all digital currencies will follow suit ‚Äì in the short term or the long. One token that has certainly accumulated momentum of late is BGB, the native currency of trading platform Bitget. Home to over 20 million users in 100 countries, Bitget launched its ERC-20 token in July 2021 and it‚Äôs been on a rather steady climb since last January. Indeed, it recently crossed $1 for the first time, at one stage hitting an all-time high of $1.15 on February 17 before falling slightly.  At the time of writing, the BGB token is still above a dollar, trading at $1.02, an increase of almost 55% in the last seven days. The rise over the past month is even more pronounced, with 70% gains. When market sentiment brightens, exchange tokens are often the biggest winners as trading activity spikes and users reap the benefits of interacting with a trading platform‚Äôs native asset. BGB is a perfect case in point and demonstrates the market‚Äôs growing confidence, as well as its potential for further growth. What is notable about BGB, though, is the steadiness of its ascent with no volatile spikes.  Irrespective of what the wider market is doing ‚Äì and post-ETF the focus is now shifting to Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth Halving event in April ‚Äì Bitget has committed to strengthening the value proposition of BGB and aligning the token with the overall growth of the exchange. A big part of this will be furnishing holders with benefits when they stake. At present, staking BGB delivers an annual return of 2%, on top of daily free withdrawal limits that help users evade the rocketing transaction fees that are a corollary of bullish market phases. Moreover, the token grants users exclusive access to projects launching on the Bitget Innovation Zone, giving token-holders an opportunity to get in on the ground floor as promising ventures lift off. Although the gains pocketed by BGB over the past month are impressive, it‚Äôs only February ‚Äì and with VC funding rising for the first time in 18 months and retail investors re-entering the market, many analysts believe the stage is set for the next crypto bull run. As Alyssa Choo, crypto equities specialist at Bitwise, observes: ‚ÄúEveryone wants to be a part of the bull market.‚Äù In light of this reality, and providing the market continues tracking positively as the Halving looms into focus, and even beyond, there is a bullish case to be made for the continued growth of BGB. Not least since the token appears undervalued compared to counterparts such as OKX‚Äôs native currency, OKB.  The market cap of BGB at the time of writing is $1.43 billion, compared to $14.8bn for OKX. Yet this disparity is not borne out by the platforms‚Äô respective trading volume, as Bitget handles approximately 70% of OKX‚Äôs volume. Moreover, Bitget‚Äôs derivative trading volume grew by an incredible 28% in the first month of the year. Needless to say, it is extremely difficult to estimate just how much upside there is in BGB ‚Äì or indeed any token. While most experts are confident bitcoin will have a banner year, and that should mean strong gains for many exchange tokens, there is no guarantee.  Certainly, native tokens belonging to exchanges which are growing in other areas ‚Äì particularly trade volume ‚Äì have stronger fundamentals behind them than highly speculative tokens not tied to tangible products, i.e. hit-and-hope memecoins.  Price aside, Bitget‚Äôs profile has been growing over the past year, thanks in no small part to its World Cup-winning brand ambassador (and possibly history‚Äôs greatest ever footballer) Lionel Messi. Unlike many competitor exchanges, it also offers a raft of ancillary products and services including an NFT Marketplace and dApp browser.  Unsurprisingly though, it‚Äôs the BGB token that‚Äôs been hogging most of the recent limelight. Investors will do well to keep a close eye on the asset in the coming months.

;;BlackRock‚Äôs New ETF Ad: Bitcoin Is ‚ÄòProgress‚Äò;BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, has released another advertisement for its spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) offering, labeling BTC as a ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and not a currency in the media campaign.  The new BlackRock Bitcoin ETF advertisement employs a simplistic design with a yellow-colored background, featuring a runway and a plane‚Äîa departure from the conventional flashy approach often associated with digital-asset-related promotions. ‚ÄúBitcoin ETFs have landed,‚Äù stated the yellow advertisement, as pointed out by senior Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas in a post on social media platform X. The seemingly mundane visual is a deliberate choice by BlackRock, aiming for a balance between a traditional investment appeal and a more modern, relatable tone. Balchunas noted that this was the ‚Äúsweet spot between the boring legacy fund and ‚Äú‚Äòhey fellow kids‚Äô type stuff.‚Äù ‚ÄúStrong advisor-friendly vibes. BlackRock on brink of pulling away as the category liquidity king, going for kill w more ads makes sense,‚Äù said Balchunas. It is important to note that BlackRock refrained from mentioning Bitcoin as a commodity or a currency that can be transferred from one user to another, but equated it with ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù Balchunas further suggested that the tagline for the IBIT ETF should have been, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok now. The adults are here.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúInteresting they equate bitcoin not w a commodity or a currency but w progress. Also they mention how the ETF standardizes BTC so it is just like your stock and bonds in portfolio. Clearly aimed at normal 60/40-ers vs the BTC faithful (who largely don‚Äôt own stocks and bonds).‚Äù Balchunas‚Äô observation was seconded by digital asset enthusiast Muhmmad Azhar on X, who added that the ‚Äúinterplay between modern simplicity and legacy gravitas in advertising is indeed a delicate dance.‚Äù Azhar believes that exciting times are waiting for the digital asset sector in the near future. As reported earlier by BitcoinNews, BlackRock released a similar ‚Äúboring‚Äù ad in January that targeted the wealthy boomers towards its spot Bitcoin ETF. The campaign featured an almost two-minute presentation by Jay Jacobs, the asset management firm‚Äôs United States head of thematic and alternative ETFs.  ‚ÄúThis is how you market to rich boomers, folks. The calm disposition, easy-to-understand investment case, soft new age music, suit with no tie‚Ä¶ everything about it says ‚Äòit‚Äôs ok now, the adults are here,‚Äô‚Äù noted Balchunas at the time. On the other hand, the spot Bitcoin ETF offering by BlackRock has become very popular among investors. It recently ranked among the top 0.2% of all Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) issued in the United States from January 1 to the end of the first week of February. Moreover, IBIT also amassed around 100,000 BTC, becoming the first one out of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs to do so. According to the data provided by the asset management firm, it currently has 115k BTC in its holdings.   Get weekly news roundups direct to your inbox!

;;Scammers Steal $1.6m via New YouTube Crypto Giveaway;      Through yet another fake YouTube cryptocurrency giveaway, some scammers have made away with more than $1,680,000 from their victim's crypto wallets after promising immediate high returns on cryptocurrency investments. Group-IB, a Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity firm, disclosed this on Friday on its website. The scammers defrauded the victims of the said sum between February 16 and 18, 2022, Group-IB said, adding that the exact number of victims and the total amount of stolen funds remains unknown. The scammers were said to have run 36 fabricated cryptocurrency giveaways via YouTube streams and used footage of Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, Michael Saylor and other crypto enthusiasts from legitimate events to create their own fraudulent streams. These YouTube channels appear to have either been hacked or purchased from underground markets, the company said. Group-IB explained: ‚ÄúOn average, such streams attracted between 3,000 and 18,000 viewers. One fake stream featuring footage of Vitalik Buterin drew more than 165,000 viewers who were promised that their crypto savings would be doubled in real-time.‚Äù Which are the platforms available out there for trading? See all here According to Group-IB, the scammers spread links to their websites in the description pages of their YouTube streams. These websites, the company noted, had been designed to show visitors ‚Äúthe mechanism behind a fake giveaway.‚Äù Several domain names often displayed one and the same crypto wallet address, the company further said, adding that its experts detected more than 30 crypto wallets used for the scheme with a total remaining balance of $933,963. Group-IB said its analysis of the scammers‚Äô domain infrastructure revealed that the 29 websites were part of a massive network of 583 interconnected resources all set up in the first quarter of 2022. ‚ÄúNotably, there were three times as many domains registered for this scheme in less than three months of 2022 compared to the whole of last year,‚Äù the firm said. The most popular cryptocurrency used by fraudsters as part of the scheme was Ethereum, the company added. Further, the cybersecurity company said its Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GIB) experts had initially retrieved the links to 29 interconnected websites featuring the guidelines on how to double the cryptocurrency investments. Most of the websites were said to have used a similar eye-catching design and high-quality images related to cryptocurrency. Group-IB explained: ‚ÄúWhen analyzing scam websites promoted during the fake streams, CERT-GIB experts detected an unusual technique. ‚ÄúDepending on the cryptocurrency and type of crypto wallets, scammers asked visitors to their fake giveaway website to enter seed phrases to connect their wallets. ‚ÄúOnce a victim shares their seed phrase, fraudsters gain control over their wallet and can withdraw all funds from it. The exact number of victims and total amount of stolen funds remains unknown, but clearly, some victims could not resist taking the bait.‚Äù Therefore, the cybersecurity firm urged crypto wallet users to be especially vigilant about free giveaways and not to share confidential data on rogue websites. In addition, it urged users to double-check the legitimacy of the streams and the websites they are visiting using official sources only. ‚ÄúIf you cannot find any information about the promotion taking place, you are likely being deceived. Seed phrases must be kept secret and stored securely,‚Äù it advised. ‚ÄúTo do so, use password management tools. To minimize the risk of leakage, prioritize desktop solutions over cloud-based ones,‚Äù Group-IB added. There has been an increasing number of crypto scams in the past few years. Last year, illegal crypto transactions hit a record high. A report by Chainalysis, a blockchain data platform, showed that illegal crypto addresses received almost $14 billion in 2021, compared to $7.8 billion in 2020. Social media has been an important source for scammers using the names and pictures of celebrity crypto enthusiasts to perpetuate crypto scams. The Co-Founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, in July 2020, sued YouTube for its alleged inaction against bitcoin scams using his images and videos to lure potential victims. In September 2021, Canada‚Äôs Vancouver Police Department (VPD) revealed that residents lost $2 million to cryptocurrency scams within a week alone. Furthermore, corporate entities are not left out of the mix. Virtu Financial, Inc., an electronic market maker, in January this year issued a public warning to warn against cryptocurrency scammers posing as its affiliates.

;15 Feb 2024, 16:55;Is MicroStrategy Still a Leveraged Bitcoin Play?;"  Pure Plays: By OPTO  Thematic investing relies on exposure to long-term trends. However, many thematic indices and funds contain stocks that do not align with their stated objectives. Seasoned emerging markets (EM) investor Kevin T Carter made this point on OPTO Sessions when explaining the drawbacks of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which, he says, selects companies based on the location of their headquarters. However, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre investing in EM consumer technology, you don‚Äôt care about where the company is. You care about where the revenue is coming from.‚Äù In other words, to gain exposure to a trend (such as EM consumer technology), it‚Äôs important to clearly identify a company‚Äôs, fund‚Äôs, or index‚Äôs source of revenue. In this OPTO series, we examine stocks that offer the purest exposure to key themes through a detailed assessment of their revenue streams. MicroStrategy [MSTR] is an interesting example of a stock that bucks the pure play trend. While it derives very little revenue from bitcoin, the cryptocurrency accounts for most of the company‚Äôs shareholder equity. MicroStrategy is a software house that develops business intelligence products for enterprises. It was a relatively obscure stock with a market cap of approximately $1.2bn until August 2020, when its CEO Michael Saylor announced plans to start spending its excess cash reserves on bitcoin as part of the company‚Äôs capital allocation scheme, making MicroStrategy the first publicly traded company to announce a cryptocurrency strategy of this kind. The upshot has been a significant increase in interest in MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock, which suddenly offered an avenue for investors that wanted exposure to bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly owning bitcoin themselves. MicroStrategy effectively turned itself into a treasury for bitcoin by filling its balance sheet with the digital asset, and its stock soared as a result. As of 15 February, MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap is nearly $13bn, up 982% from August 2020. Saylor has consistently maintained the strategy; in the final month of 2023, MicroStrategy acquired 14,620 bitcoin for $616m. This approach has made MicroStrategy a darling for crypto advocates. It is the largest holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF [BLOK], accounting for 6% of the fund‚Äôs assets. Because it uses debt financing and share sales to pay for its bitcoin stores, MicroStrategy is more than just a proxy for bitcoin price movements. It acts as a leveraged play on the cryptocurrency with no added fees, Saylor told Bloomberg TV in December. As such, its price movements can be more volatile than those of bitcoin itself.  However, despite gains in the market value of bitcoin during the period it has been acquiring it, MicroStrategy has been writing down the value of its bitcoin assets. Accounting rules in the US state that an intangible asset is considered impaired if, at any point during a reporting period, its value drops below its purchase price. Its ‚Äòcarrying value‚Äô must then be permanently written down to the lowest value that it reached during that reporting period, and the company must recognise a corresponding loss. MicroStrategy buys bitcoin every quarter, but given the asset‚Äôs volatility, it will frequently dip below the purchase price later on. So ‚Äî highly counter-intuitively ‚Äî MicroStrategy has technically made $2.3bn of impairment losses on bitcoin assets it had bought for $5.9bn, and which as of 31 December were valued at over $8bn. This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that its bitcoin strategy has swelled MicroStrategy‚Äôs balance sheet. Its digital assets increased 97.3% year-over-year in 2023, and accounted for 76% of total assets, which grew by 97.5%. Revenues from MicroStrategy‚Äôs software business actually fell 0.6% from 2022, but thanks to its bitcoin strategy, its stockholder equity increased from a deficit of $383.1m to $2.2bn. For MicroStrategy investors, it has paid to look beyond revenue as the defining factor of a stock‚Äôs purity. MicroStrategy‚Äôs software arm generated a $96.3m profit in Q4 2023, but the market value of the bitcoin it held at the end of the quarter increased by $3.8bn, or 88%, from Q3. The company spent $1.2bn on new bitcoin assets during this period, but its pre-existing bitcoin reserves increased in value by $2.6bn, dwarfing the contribution that the company‚Äôs software profits added to its balance sheet during the quarter. In other words, while MicroStrategy is a software stock as far as its revenue is concerned, bitcoin price movements account for the vast majority of changes in its shareholder equity. Despite accounting rules that mark down the carrying value of bitcoin holdings, Saylor‚Äôs strategy has been a success since its launch in August 2020, largely due to bitcoin‚Äôs outsized gains during that period. Given the volatility of bitcoin, and the amount of high-profile events that have occurred over the last three and a half years (such as the collapse of FTX in 2022), it is unsurprising that both MicroStrategy stock and spot bitcoin prices have seen giddy highs and crushing lows during that period. As of 15 February, bitcoin has gained 356.5% over the life of MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin uptake strategy, while the company‚Äôs stock has gained 521.3%. However ‚Äî and despite Saylor insisting the opposite ‚Äî recent developments could undermine the relationship between MicroStrategy stock and bitcoin prices. The SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in January, meaning that investors who wanted exposure to bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly owning it suddenly had alternatives to MicroStrategy. Saylor told Bloomberg TV in December that the launch of such ETFs wouldn‚Äôt threaten MicroStrategy since its stock was already a fee-free, leveraged bet on bitcoin. Historically, this appears accurate; almost every time the bitcoin price has increased since August 2020, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has gained more than the cryptocurrency. That volatility has, at times, also meant the stock has taken steeper falls. Since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs on 11 January, both assets have increased in value, but MicroStrategy‚Äôs gains of 43.6% have outpaced bitcoin‚Äôs 11.8%. It is noteworthy that Saylor himself sold as many as 5,000 shares during the week prior to the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Other erstwhile bulls have also signalled their hesitancy. While it remains the top holding in the fund, Amplify‚Äôs BLOK ETF sold 15,772 MicroStrategy shares in Q4 of last year, according to WhaleWisdom data.

Posts on X on Thursday and Friday lean into one of the hot stories of the moment in crypto: the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which, as a result of a recent court victory, could be on its way toward being converted into a favorite traditional financial investment vehicle known as an ETF. The core message: a claim that $25 million of a new token called GBTC ‚Äì the ticker symbol associated with the real $13 billion trust ‚Äì will be distributed to folks who visit a website mentioned in the post. The catch: The account making these promises, @Grayscale_FND, has nothing to do with the real company called Grayscale, a fact confirmed by a Grayscale spokesperson on Friday; the offer is an obvious scam. Before Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X, a blue checkmark ‚Äì like the one emblazoned on @Grayscale_FND‚Äôs account ‚Äì was a sign the account was verified, that some measure of thought and vetting had occurred before the account got that label. Now, it means the account owner can afford $8 a month, giving rise to a proliferation of crypto scams wielding blue-checked X accounts. The real @Grayscale X account has a gold checkmark, a designation reserved for companies and other ""official"" organizations. To avoid getting tricked, one thing an X user would need to know is that new distinction. But they could also be fooled by the fact that @Grayscale_FND uses the logo of the real Grayscale. A CoinDesk journalist was made aware of @Grayscale_FND's posts because somebody spammed him with it on X. @Grayscale_FND doesn't accept direct messages from accounts it doesn't follow, so there is no way to reach whoever is behind it. Grayscale is, like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Currency Group. The reply to an email sent to X's address for the press: ""Busy now, please check back later.""

;;Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Worth Over $10B;Michael Saylor‚Äôs business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy, has seen its Bitcoin holdings now worth more than $10 billion. Indeed, the total value of the holdings has skyrocketed as the asset is nearing the $53,000 mark to close out the week. Moreover, the company‚Äôs Bitcoin investment has simultaneously eclipsed $4 billion in profit. In a recent investor presentation, Microstrategy stated that they had acquired a total of 190,000 BTC for a total of $5.93 billion. Subsequently, that acquisition came at $31,224 per BTC. Therefore, the overall profit of the early Bitcoin bet is paying off big amid its noticeable surge over the last week. Also Read: Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy Bitcoin Hits $3.5B Unrealized Profit For many digital asset investors, 2024 was set to be a monumental year. Specifically, it would see the price of Bitcoin lead the industry to a massive uptick in value. The presence of newly-approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs would set the stage for what could be a vital year for its value growth. Subsequently, some of the earliest believers in the asset are seeing their investments pay off. Among them is none other than Michael Saylor, whose business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy has seen its Bitcoin holdings surpass $10 billion in value. Also Read: Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Potential Tenfold Surge Indeed, the value of those holdings has seen a massive uptick as BTC itself has observed quite a surge over the last week. Surpassing $52,000 earlier, the price is slowly near the key $53,000 level. Amid that increase, MicrStrategy‚Äôs holdings have resulted in $4 billion worth of profit. MicroStrategy first began its Bitcoin acquisition plan in 2020 and has increased its holdings in every single quarter since. Since just last year, the value of those tokens has doubled following a 20% rally since 2024 first started. Conversely, with the Bitcoin halving on the horizon, the value of those tokens should continue to grow.  Disclaimer: Our articles are NOT financial advice, we are not financial advisors.

MicroStrategy is got a levered operating strategy for Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor told Bloomberg‚Äôs Katie Greifeld. ‚ÄúBut if you look at what the spot ETFs are doing, they're facilitating the digital transformation of capital. And every day, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy.‚Äù While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Bitcoin ETFs, chair Gary Gensler told CNBC the approvals were not an endorsement of the digital asset. ‚ÄúAs we like to say, we're merit-neutral,‚Äù Gensler said. ‚ÄúThis was not in any way an approval of Bitcoin that existed‚Äîit's just how to trade it in these Exchange Traded products.‚Äú A prominent holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has accumulated over 190,000 BTC, worth around $10 billion. For his part, Saylor has been anything but traditional regarding how he and MicroStrategy invest in Bitcoin. ‚ÄúI've famously said, I'm going to be buying the top forever,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúBitcoin is the exit strategy, it is the strongest asset, so what we see right now is that Bitcoin just emerges as a trillion-dollar asset class. And it's alongside names like Apple, Google and Microsoft.‚Äù Last year, despite widening losses, MicroStrategy continued to buy Bitcoin. In January, Saylor sold $216 Million in personal MicroStrategy stock options to buy more Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThere's not a lot enough room in the capital structure of those companies to hold 10 trillion or $100 trillion worth of capital,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúSo Bitcoin is competing against gold, which is 10x. What it is right now, it's competing against the S&P index, is competing against Real Estate $100 trillion-plus asset class as a store of value.‚Äù Calling Bitcoin technically superior to these asset classes, Saylor said he believes capital will continue to flow out of those asset classes into Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThat being the case, there's just no reason to sell the winner to buy the losers,‚Äù Saylor concluded.

;;Michael Saylor Says Demand for Bitcoin Outstrips Supply by 10x: Is He Right?; In a recent CNBC interview, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, cast a spotlight on the burgeoning demand for Bitcoin (BTC), estimating it to outpace supply by an astounding tenfold. As cryptocurrency markets brim with excitement over the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs, Saylor‚Äôs comments have fueled excited discussions about Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory and its implications for the broader market. Saylor attributed the explosive demand for Bitcoin to the recent introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) catering to the cryptocurrency. These ETFs, he argued, are not just a new investment vehicle but represent nearly a decade of pent-up demand from investors eager for accessible BTC products. They make gaining direct exposure to Bitcoin significantly easier for both retail traders and institutions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs ten times as much demand for bitcoin coming into these ETFs as there is supply coming from the natural sellers who are the miners,‚Äù Saylor emphasized, highlighting the significant imbalance driving BTC‚Äôs price upward. He‚Äôs certainly correct that the advent of these ETFs is driving an increase in volume but it‚Äôs impossible to say if it will last. The allure of Bitcoin, according to Saylor, lies in its unique characteristics: it is uncorrelated with traditional risk assets and immune to the economic and geopolitical vulnerabilities that plague other investments.   This digital asset offers a haven not tethered to the fluctuations of any single country, company, or external factor, making it an increasingly attractive option for investors worldwide. In a move reflecting the company‚Äôs successful multi-year foray into cryptocurrency, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy would rebrand itself as a Bitcoin development company. This strategic pivot aims to leverage the firm‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs largest public company holder of Bitcoin, focusing on accumulating more Bitcoin and fostering the growth of the BTC network. Saylor‚Äôs comparison of MicroStrategy to a real estate or petroleum development company underscores the innovative approach the firm is taking towards cryptocurrency investment and development. Listen to Michael @Saylor explain why his company owns $8,200,000,000 of #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/E7BuH55qmt ‚Äî Documenting ‚Çøitcoin üìÑ (@DocumentingBTC) February 7, 2024  Adding to the bullish sentiment, Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm, released a research note suggesting that Bitcoin is ‚Äústronger‚Äù ahead of its anticipated halving event, It points to improved technical fundamentals and increased use cases as the drivers of this strength. The note points to the surge in on-chain activity driven by innovations like ordinal inscriptions and the BRC-20 standard, which have introduced new revenue streams for miners and revitalized developer interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin was a simple blockchain that couldn‚Äôt facilitate the use of other tokens on its network until the invention of the BRC-20 standard changed that notion entirely. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed significant holdings since their launch, are expected to exert further buying pressure on the market. With the halving event poised to reduce the reward for mining BTC blocks, the resulting decrease in selling pressure, coupled with sustained demand, could lead to a steady price increase for Bitcoin in the post-halving landscape. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the insights shared by Michael Saylor and the analysis from Grayscale point towards a robust future for Bitcoin. The interplay between increased ETF-driven demand, strategic corporate involvement in BTC development, and the innovative use cases emerging on the Bitcoin blockchain paints a picture of a maturing market ready for the next phase of growth. With the potential for Bitcoin ETFs to introduce a new wave of investors to the cryptocurrency market, the dynamics of supply and demand are set to undergo significant shifts. Especially as BTC approaches its next halving event ‚Äì a potential imminent supply shock, the market watches closely, anticipating the impact of these developments on BTC‚Äôs price and its broader role in the financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the bullish outlook shared by Michael Saylor, coupled with the strategic shifts and market analyses, underscores the growing recognition of BTC‚Äôs unique value proposition. He is far from the only analyst pointing out the many positive signals surrounding Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. As demand continues to outstrip supply and the market braces for the halving event, the stage is set for an intriguing chapter in Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing evolution.

;;MicroStrategy's $10B bitcoin stash sits on 70% unrealized profit;"Jason Koerner/Getty Images Entertainment Enterprise-software provider MicroStrategy's (NASDAQ:MSTR) bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings are worth some $10B, based on current prices, sitting on an unrealized profit of nearly 70%. Earlier this month, Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) said it held 190K bitcoin on its balance sheet, with a total cost of $5.93B, or $31,224 per token. The company started to invest its cash into BTC in 2020, only to become the biggest corporate holder of the highest-profile cryptocurrency. This year alone, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has climbed 17.7%, hitting an over two-year high of $52.7K on Thursday. MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, which gained ~22% so far this year, has a strong relationship with the price of bitcoin, as seen in this chart. Over the years, the company has raised capital by selling stock and issuing bonds to buy large blocks of bitcoin (BTC-USD), making MSTR a proxy for the digital token. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ""is novel, digital, global, unique, and uncorrelated to traditional risk assets,"" Saylor said in a recent post on X.

;;;" It won‚Äôt happen. I hold more than all BTC worth of $1. I won‚Äôt sell them. And I know some people who won‚Äôt sell it too. So, $1 is impossible.
And imagine, I lost all my BTC and it dropped - I would buy more. Easy! Just be true believer, study that and be happy and rich :) As a manager at Asana, I use Asana to keep my team coordinated and connected‚Äîespecially in this time of increased remote work
. Right now, staying connected and organized is more important than ever, which is why Asana‚Äôs clarity and ease of collaboration helps my team do better work from anywhere. If you‚Äôre managing a team or program, you likely have multiple projects in progress at the same time. But keeping track of all the moving pieces quickly gets complicated. Without a good process for managing multiple projects, it‚Äôs hard to know what work to prioritize, how to help your team effectively                Bitcoin is only valuable because its users believe it is.              I have no idea who Michael Saylor is, how much BTC he bought, or at what price. For a quick calculation, just divide the $69,000 by the purchase price. This will give you the factor, by which his investment will go up. Then, just multiply his investment by this factor. That will give you the value at the end. The profit is this value, minus the initial investment. In practice, there may be transaction costs (such as cryptocurrency fees); but if you buy a lot of bitcoins at, say, $20,000, and sell them at $69,000, those fees will be insignificant in comparison. And he may have to pay taxes - for exa       It is difficult to say for certain what Michael Saylor did with his Bitcoin in 2022, but it is likely that he sold at least some of it. Bitcoin prices were on the rise in late 2021 and early 2022, reaching a high of $20,000 in January of that year. It is likely that Saylor saw this as an opportunity to make a profit and sold some of his Bitcoin at that time. There are tons (obviously), but in my mind these are the worst: 1. Not using an adblocker. If you aren‚Äôt using an ad blocker yet, I am begging you to try one. I am not exaggerating when I say it will change your life. A good ad blocker will eliminate virtually all of the ads you‚Äôd see on the internet. No more YouTube ads, no more banner ads, no more pop-up ads, etc. It‚Äôs incredible. Most people I know use Total Adblock (link here
) ‚Äì it‚Äôs $2.42/month, but there are plenty of solid options.

;;Defi on BTC blockchain could accumulate $225b, Pantera Capital says;share Analysts at Pantera Capital see a half-trillion-dollar opportunity in bringing decentralized finance to Bitcoin, potentially making Bitcoin-based decentralized apps top assets in crypto. Pantera Capital analysts have identified a significant opportunity worth over half a trillion dollars in bringing decentralized finance (defi) to the Bitcoin blockchain, potentially positioning Bitcoin-based decentralized applications as leading assets in the crypto space. In a recent email newsletter, Pantera Capital highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to accumulate $450 billion in liquidity through defi projects, particularly if they achieve similar market shares as those that can be seen on the Ethereum blockchain right now. So far, Ethereum dominates the defi landscape, hosting the majority of activity, according to Pantera Capital. Historically, decentralized applications on Ethereum have represented between 8% and 50% of Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization, with the current figure standing at approximately 25%. Extrapolating these proportions to Bitcoin suggests the potential for the network to attract around $225 billion in value. Moreover, Pantera Capital predicts that the leading decentralized application on Bitcoin could eventually reach a valuation of $20 billion, firmly establishing itself among the top most valuable assets in the ecosystem. ‚ÄúThis would place it squarely in the top 10 most valuable assets in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is nearly back to being a trillion-dollar asset. Yet, it still holds an untapped half-trillion dollar opportunity.‚Äù Pantera Capital In mid-January, Pantera Capital emphasized the importance of selecting tokens with robust underlying protocols and proven product-market fit, expecting them to outperform in the upcoming cycle. Although Pantera Capital did not name specific tokens, the firm said that over the long term, token selection will be ‚Äúparamount because outperformance will be on a case-by-case basis and not necessarily in a certain sector or based on fickle, short-lived speculative narratives.‚Äù The hedge fund also said it expects the growth of defi on the Bitcoin blockchain to continue in the foreseeable future, with total value locked on the platform potentially rising to 1-2% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap.

;;Michael Saylor Says MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin;"                                                                                                                   Andrew Throuvalas  MicroStrategy remains fully committed to its macro-strategy of investing everything it can into Bitcoin. Company CEO Michael Saylor recently confirmed that the company would ‚Äúnever‚Äù sell its Bitcoin, even given the current state of the market. Though the asset has helped the institution profit tremendously overall, it is down on its 2021 positions. The CEO affirmed his devotion to Bitcoin in a recent interview with Bloomberg. However, Saylor dismissed the thought when asked whether he was tempted to sell given Bitcoin‚Äôs slide over the past two months. ‚ÄúNever. No. We‚Äôre not sellers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only acquiring and holding Bitcoin, right? That‚Äôs our strategy.‚Äù Saylor first announced his company‚Äôs plan to convert its cash holdings to Bitcoin in the Summer of 2020. The excitement generated by the move swung MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock up as high as 900% ever since the software vendor has made regular Bitcoin purchases in hundreds of millions of dollars at a time. According to Saylor‚Äôs updates over Twitter, its most recent purchase in December put its holdings at 124,391. That‚Äôs over 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist. Yet, in light of last year, Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin position hasn‚Äôt exactly been profitable. Since February, the average listing price for every Bitcoin his company has bought is above current levels. Nevertheless, earlier buys leave MicroStrategy‚Äôs total Bitcoin still in the green. Fundamentally, Saylor considers Bitcoin the greatest weapon against inflation in existence. For example, in the United States, CPI inflation was 7.0% for December 2021 ‚Äì the highest in 39 years. ‚ÄúThe best defense against inflation is a Bitcoin standard. So I don‚Äôt really think we could do anything better to position our company in an inflationary environment than to convert our balance sheet to Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. Saylor has spoken on numerous occasions arguing for Bitcoin‚Äôs astronomically high long term price potential. Calling it the ‚Äúapex property of the human race,‚Äù he even surmised that it could reach a $100 trillion market cap. Per Bitcoin, that would be about $5 million. For this reason, MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation goes beyond defensive inflation hedging and is now its primary method for making a profit. In addition, many investors are now using MicroStrategy as a quasi- spot Bitcoin ETF, given that a real one is yet to receive SEC approval.

;CRYPTO ECOSYSTEMS 01/11/24 12:22PM EST;MicroStrategy CEO Saylor says bitcoin‚Äôs near-term volatility largely irrelevant;"Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term volatility is largely irrelevant once you understand the fundamentals of the leading cryptocurrency and how difficult it would be to create something better, according to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. ""Bitcoin is the most certain thing in a very uncertain world, it's more certain than the other 19,000 cryptocurrencies, it's more certain than any stock, it's more certain than owning property anywhere in the world,‚Äù he said in an interview with The Block last week after appearing at CoinMarketCap‚Äôs The Capital virtual conference. People who have spent at least $100 on bitcoin can speak about the cryptocurrency, Saylor allowed, but otherwise they probably ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have anything to say about it.‚Äù  Saylor‚Äôs software company holds a massive bitcoin position ‚Äî owning, including through subsidiaries, about 129,218 bitcoins ‚Äî and he has become a leading proponent of the cryptocurrency since adding it to his company‚Äôs balance sheet in August 2020. MicroStrategy‚Äôs most recent purchase, revealed in an April 5 filing, was the acquisition of 4,167 bitcoin worth about $190.5 million at the time, when bitcoin was trading at $45,714. The company has acquired its total bitcoin holdings at an average price of $30,700. With bitcoin trading at  $29,716.37 on Sunday, Saylor‚Äôs company is in the red on its purchases ‚Äî although it has no plans to sell, he said.  He said bitcoin would have to fall 95% before the company would consider doing anything, even then, he has said in the past, the company could post alternative collateral.  In order to fund its bitcoin bet, MicroStrategy took out three loans between December 2020 and June 2021 by issuing convertible senior notes and senior secured notes.  Convertible senior notes are debt securities that contain options to be converted into a certain amount of the issuer‚Äôs equity once they hit maturity. When they mature they must either be converted into equity, repaid in cash or a combination of both. Senior secured notes are loans that use the issuer‚Äôs assets as a form of collateral. MicroStrategy issued senior secured notes in June 2021, secured by assets that included any bitcoin bought on or after the closing of the offering. Still, it did not include any of MicroStrategy‚Äôs existing bitcoin, or any that might be purchased with the proceeds from existing bitcoin or other holdings.  In May, MicroStrategy‚Äôs share price hit a 20-month low of $159.67 before recovering to close the month at $246.65, still down from an open of $355.68. During the month, the company‚Äôs bitcoin position fell into the red, where it remains.  Bitcoin prices plunged in May, as the cryptocurrency market, as well as broader financial markets, were in tumult. After an initial crash in crypto prices early in the month, and as the wider macroeconomic environment worsened, prices plunged further amid the Terra blockchain collapse, following the failure of its stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).  This contagion dragged bitcoin below $30,000 as it fell to its lowest levels in 18 months, since trading at about $27,000 on December 21, 2020. While many observers declared this to be clear evidence of a crypto bear market, Saylor said he is not convinced.  ‚ÄúI don't know if it's a bear market or not, but if it is a bear market, then we had three of them in the last 24 months,‚Äù he told The Block. Saylor was alluding to April 2021, when the price rose to $60,000 before falling back to about $31,000 by July 2021, then hitting all-time highs of $69,000 in November 2021.  Saylor said he prefers not to get caught up in near-term prices, adding that people focusing too much on charts are ‚Äúplaying with tea leaves.‚Äù His take: ‚ÄúIf you're not planning to hold it for four years, you're not really an investor at all, you're a trader, and my advice for traders is don't trade it, invest in it.‚Äù One of the primary reasons bitcoin and crypto prices fell in May was the capitulation of TerraUSD and luna (LUNA), the Terra blockchain‚Äôs two main offerings.  Terra‚Äôs ecosystem came under pressure after its stablecoin, TerraUSD, lost its peg against the dollar on May 7. A shared relationship between TerraUSD and luna then dragged both down, even though TerraUSD had a ‚Äúforex reserve‚Äù of more than $3 billion in bitcoin that it offloaded in a futile attempt to defend its peg. TerraUSD had a burn mechanism involving luna so that anyone holding TerraUSD could trade one token for $1 worth of luna tokens in the event of a de-peg ‚Äî if TerraUSD were trading at $0.95 for example.  This would make TerraUSD more scarce and was supposed to pull the price back toward $1, also allowing holders to take advantage of the price difference and potentially make an arbitrage profit, incentivizing them to maintain the peg. Still, after TerraUSD lost its dollar peg on May 7, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) ‚Äî a non-profit managing Terra‚Äôs forex reserve ‚Äî  used up most of its reserves to buy UST in an unsuccessful attempt to defend the peg. Despite the collapse of TerraUSD and the depletion of its bitcoin reserves, Saylor maintained that bitcoin is a worthwhile reserve asset.  ‚ÄúI think it all comes down to the amount of leverage. I think it makes a lot of sense to use bitcoin as a reserve asset,‚Äù he said, noting that with reasonable leverage, such as owning $1 billion worth of bitcoin and issuing $50 million worth of a stablecoin, there would be significantly less risk involved with using bitcoin as a reserve asset.  The issue with Terra wasn't so much the idea of owning bitcoin, he said, but that they had too much TerraUSD outstanding.

;;Michael Saylor says investing in MicroStrategy is the closest you'll get to a bitcoin spot ETF;"                                                                                                                    Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET In this article MIAMI ‚Äî MicroStrategy
may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but CEO Michael Saylor says the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin
spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,‚Äù Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami. So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has only approved ETFs that track contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. The commission has refused to greenlight any of the formal applications for a pure-play bitcoin-based ETF ‚Äî a financial instrument that would give investors the chance to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the motions of signing up for an exchange, opening a crypto wallet, or dealing with any of the other logistics involved with buying and holding bitcoin. ‚ÄúIf there was a spot ETF, you‚Äôd be paying a 1% fee, and it wouldn‚Äôt be leveraged. With MicroStrategy, we have a software company that generates cash flow, so we convert our cash flows into bitcoin,‚Äù continued Saylor, who says the de facto MicroStrategy bitcoin spot ETF generates a 4% to 5% tax-deferred yield. MicroStrategy, which was launched by Saylor in 1989, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet for the last two years. The company has now spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700. Saylor doesn‚Äôt have any plans to stop buying bitcoin, which will only further grow MicroStrategy‚Äôs exposure to the digital asset. ‚ÄúWhy would we ever stop?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs we generate cash flows, we think that the responsible thing to do for our shareholders is we convert currency which is devaluing, into an asset which is appreciating,‚Äù said Saylor, who also noted that MicroStrategy is not diversifying because he feels the company owes shareholders a consistent strategy. ‚ÄúIf you want to be 2% exposed to bitcoin, you‚Äôd put 2% of your portfolio into MicroStrategy, and the other 98% of your portfolio, you can invest in whatever you want. They don‚Äôt want the CEO of a publicly traded company to be unpredictable and random.‚Äù When MicroStrategy first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in August 2020, it was a pretty unpopular thing to do. This was back at the tail end of the crypto winter when the coin was trading in the low $11,000 range, and many institutional investors and big Wall Street banks remained bearish on digital assets. But Saylor‚Äôs move soon proved prescient. As bitcoin‚Äôs upswing began in earnest in October 2020, old-school, billionaire hedge fund managers like Stanley Druckenmiller reversed course and began buying bitcoin. Major companies like Tesla
, Block
(formerly Square), and insurer MassMutual also followed suit, plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin. This kind of mainstream adoption is hugely important, because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren‚Äôt backed by an asset, nor do they have the full faith and backing of the government. They‚Äôre valuable, in part, because people believe they‚Äôre valuable. So it goes a long way when bitcoin gets buy-in from some of the biggest names on Wall Street. Saylor‚Äôs evangelism of bitcoin has helped to make him an A-lister in the community. Throughout the Bitcoin 2022 conference, Saylor would traverse the Miami Beach Convention Center trailed by an entourage of fans, vying for a selfie with him. Blue chip CEOs also look to the MicroStrategy CEO for a how-to on corporate adoption. MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral ‚Äî to then buy more of the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúWe have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I‚Äôm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,‚Äù said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital
also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank. ‚ÄúAs people realize they can borrow against something, then they realize they never have to sell it, and then they start to stretch their time horizon from ‚Äî ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a 36-month speculation,‚Äô to ‚Äî ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a 36-year holding,‚Äô‚Äù Saylor told CNBC.

Supporting his sentiment, Saylor believes that in this case, there is no reason to sell the winner (BTC) to buy the losers (others).  ‚ÄùBitcoin is the exit strategy,‚Äù he said. MicroStrategy holds 190,000 BTC, worth around $9.88 billion at current prices. This makes the firm one of the major holders of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price market behavior exhibits a consolidation phase, as evident in the recent trading sessions. BTC is currently in a tight range, with resistance near the $52,500 level and support around the $50,850 mark. Bitcoin attempted to breach the resistance at $52,515, which was short-lived as it retraced back into its established range. Additionally, BTC is trading above the 100-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, which indicate strong bullish sentiments for the BTC price. The 50-day SMA is trading above the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross at $42,895, further supporting the bullish prospects for the price.  The Relative Strength Index is currently on a downward trend as it moves to the oversold region at 40. If the oscillator reaches the 30-oversold region, it likely indicates that the price is set to rebound, signaling investors to consider buying. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line (blue) is trading below the signal line (orange) but above the zero line, which may signal an impending bullish reversal. The red bars further support this as they reduce in size towards the zero line. The Bitcoin price technical analysis shows bullish bias, evident from the price trending within the rising channel. The bulls are aiming to come out of the consolidation phase within the channel, breaching the upper boundary of the channel. The bulls are currently targeting $57,500. However, the MACD line is trending downward towards the zero line. If the line crosses below the line, it may cause a price retrace to $48,642, coinciding with the immediate support zone, the 100-day SMA. Meanwhile, investors are turning to Bitcoin Minetrix, a Bitcoin derivative that analysts say has the potential to 10X on launch.

;;Michael Saylor: ‚ÄúNo Reason to Sell‚Äù Bitcoin;Bitcoin mega-whale Michael Saylor has said that there is ‚Äúno reason to sell‚Äù any of the coins held by his company Microstrategy as he would only be doing so for an inferior asset. Microstrategy currently holds 190,000 bitcoin, and there are concerns within the community about what would happen to the market if Saylor began to take profits. However, Saylor isn‚Äôt minded to shed any Microstrategy bitcoin any time soon, calling it the ‚Äúexit strategy‚Äù compared to other assets and fiat currency. Saylor made the comments to Bloomberg TV, where he emphasized MicroStrategy‚Äôs long-term commitment to holding its bitcoin reserves, suggesting that the company may never divest from its holdings. Saylor highlighted the pivotal role of spot Bitcoin ETFs in facilitating institutional capital inflows into the Bitcoin ecosystem, stating, ‚ÄúThe spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem.‚Äù He underscored the transformative impact of these ETFs on capital, with significant amounts transitioning from traditional analog assets to the digital economy daily. Saylor compared Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization, now exceeding a trillion dollars, with other traditional asset classes such as gold, real estate, and the S&P index, all of which have market capitalizations many times higher, arguing that Bitcoin‚Äôs technical superiority positions it as a superior investment option compared to these traditional assets, suggesting that capital will continue to flow into Bitcoin from other asset classes. Microstrategy‚Äôs bitcoin holdings, which stood at 190,000 at the end of January, were acquired at an average cost of $31,220 per coin. With Bitcoin‚Äôs current trading price hovering around $52,000, the company‚Äôs holdings are estimated to be worth approximately $10 billion, representing a profit of about $4 billion. Despite the considerable gains, Saylor reiterated his commitment to holding onto the cryptocurrency for the long term, stating emphatically that ‚ÄúBitcoin is the exit strategy.‚Äù BitStarz Casino Stake mBit Casino 7bit Casino True Flip Casino ;fullycrypto.com;https://fullycrypto.com/michael-saylor-no-reason-to-sell-bitcoin;Copyright ¬© 2024 FullyCrypto.
