However, the supposed giveaway actually intends stealing personal information and money rather than magnanimous charity. This article will break down exactly how the devious scam ensnares victims step-by-step alongside protection tips to avoid potential damages.   This Article Contains: A fraudulent online campaign claiming universally-beloved comedy icon Jennifer Aniston has teamed up with Apple facilitating an epic giveaway gifting free MacBook laptops aims exploiting fans through deception and psychological manipulation rather than reasonable charity. The scam commonly starts circulating via video advertisements run across social platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube featuring deepfake AI footage realistically depicting Aniston endorsing the exclusive holiday promotion. “Hey guys, Jennifer Aniston here with some exciting news!” the simulated ads show Aniston cheerfully sharing behind a MacBook bearing her branded logo. “To celebrate the holidays this year, I’ve partnered with Apple to give away THOUSANDS of the gorgeous rose gold MacBook Airs totally free!” The fabricated Aniston representation urges viewers act fast clicking onscreen links claiming offer details revealing MacBook ownership pending only small $2 voucher fees. “Meet our previous giveaway winners and learn how to participate yourself before remaining inventory runs out!” fake Aniston declares pointing at 11 smiling purported laptop recipients beside her. “Hurry and click below to take our eligibility quiz now because only limited supply still remains!” Enticed social media users then click personalized tracking links expecting official Apple contest pages. However, redirects route victims through a series of external phishing websites like “jettrainingworld.com” completely unrelated to Apple or Ms. Aniston’s official businesses. Deceptive portal pages feature familiar MacBook branding and imagery aiming to perpetuate initial perceptions around the free laptop giveaway rather than raising skepticism. Website headers exclaim: “3499 Rose Gold MacBook Airs Still Available to Ship for Holiday Giveaway Participants – Meet Previous Winners!” Sprinkled amid the hype, fake customer testimonials like Jordan Blum’s suspicious smiling review lend perceived credibility implying he successfully participated: “I just got it and it is amazing! Can’t believe I got this for basically free! What a STEAL.” But the manufactured social proof aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. In reality, buried terms and conditions eventually disclose victims submitting entry forms and processing fees actually consent steep recurring subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than securing free MacBook prizes. The scam simply intends stealing money and information rather than reasonably gifting laptops worth over $1,000. By recognizing manipulative hooks early explaining unbelievable “free” gifts tied to respected brands require temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, improved vigilance best avoids falling prey themselves. The fraudulent Jennifer Aniston MacBook giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims systematically through the following deceptive process: The scam starts by using AI deepfake videos to falsely portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extravagant holiday giveaway of free MacBook laptops to a select group of social media fans who enter in time. This familiar celebrity face grabs initial attention and triggers shares spreading wider reach. Clicking on misleading video captions and embedded URL links reroutes viewers outside platforms to elaborate intermediate scam portal pages completely unassociated with Apple or the real Jennifer Aniston. These showcase the Apple MacBook icon plus more AI-generated imagery of Aniston furthering initial impressions around the giveaway’s perceived legitimacy and exclusivity. Sprinkled among portal pages, fake customer reviews and stock model images smiling beside shipped boxes build false social proof implying previous contest winners already successfully received expensive Apple laptops simply covering delivery fees. “I just got it and it is amazing!” reads a suspicious account attributed to Jordan Blum. “What a STEAL.” But the fabricated hype aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. The false scarcity, celebrity endorsement, urgency cues and social proof elements compel desired actions outside rational thought. When visitors attempt securing devices through order forms, extensive personalized questionnaires conveniently require private input exceeding reasonable needs identifying shipping locations. Hidden fine print passages encased within lengthy website terms and conditions associated with giveaway order forms reveal victims actually consent steep recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time product shipments. Once scam operators possess compromised confidential information, recurring credit card charges activate alongside potentials reselling data through unregulated dark web channels inflicting additional long-term damages through identity theft. Either generates long-term financial injuries inflicted upon manipulation victims falling for fictional celebrity-fronted contests leaving them utterly empty-handed. The supposed Jennifer Aniston free MacBook giveaway flows heavily through major social media channels like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated video content and other deception tactics targeting users. Let’s review what suspicious signals commonly expose the too-good-to-be-true laptop promotion on each platform. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common problems: Specifically, glossy video spots insisting Jennifer Aniston has gifted MacBook Airs to random followers deserves heavy skepticism vetting truthfulness. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to supposed free MacBook offers: For example, a brand new Instagram profile for “JenniferAnistonRamirez” regularly posting about MacBook sweepstakes entry from Nigeria seems reasonably dubious. Scrutinize these indicators TikTok videos likely intend socially engineering increased MacBook scam participation: When grand opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good be true often is. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites to help lend credibility justifying later requests for personal user information. Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate Apple’s iconic branding without legal rights or permissions. Logos, product images and even pricing copies real MacBook listings aiming to dupe visitors initially believing observation legitimate authorized retailer online storefronts. Another effective tactic giving the illusion of third-party endorsement involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes praising the epic giveaway values. But scrutinizing these message statements against credible media archives reveals no records correlating to actual endorsement press releases. For example, sites proclaim: “I absolutely love my rose gold MacBook Air for streaming ‘The Morning Show’ from anywhere!” says attributed Jennifer Aniston quote. “So excited watch fans unbox their very own new laptops TikTok this holiday season after entering our biggest tech giveaway ever!” But misinforming visitors intends lowering guard requesting financial disclosures rather than transparency reasonably offering extravagant free gifts in exchange for little. While flashy incentives prompt acting before thoroughly reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages disclose victims registering for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges rather than one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus giveaways. Finally, running themes across scam websites stay hiding the true controlling parties through obscuring domain registration data behind proxy site ownership protections rather than providing visible legitimate business details. So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected celebrity status tempt likelihood engagement, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages. Remain empowered spotting past emotional hooks and facade obscuring ulterior motives. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting seemingly legitimate giveaways or free trials, here are proactive next steps: Contact any credit card, debit card or digital wallet providers tied to scam payments alerting them you discovered an appliance scam scheme falsely claiming celebrity endorsement used as pretext enabling undisclosed monthly account charges without consent. Inform them this violates expected giveaway terms outlined involving only reasonable one-time voucher shipment-related costs. Ask urgently about launching fraud disputes and request provisional reimbursements until resolved. Supply details on the offending business names, domains or parent companies behind recurring charges. Follow their guidance strengthening cases demonstrating damages incurred under demonstrably deceptive pretenses. Collect customer service contact information from monthly billing statements tied to scam services and subscriptions. Call each provider clearly revoking any past payment authorization now aware those were based on false representations and predatory concealment rather than reasonable sweepstakes disclosure terms initially pitched. Record confirmation details should charges inexplicably continue. Since compromised sensitive information remains exploited repeatedly, immediately update passwords, security answers and enable stronger multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible across pertinent logins. Additionally, update contact email addresses and phone numbers previously provided fraudsters. Turn on credit monitoring services alerting suspicious activities and consider proactive bureau notifyers or credit freezes as well limiting potential exacerbated cases identity theft result these data breaches. File reports about all offending companies and scam portals with both government and third-party consumer protection groups like the Federal Trade Commission, FBI Cybercrime Division or Internet Crime Complaint Center documenting damages incurred under demonstrably false pretenses. Such filings support investigating the broader interstate patterns of repeat offenders ultimately improving outcomes and recovery options for all negatively affected victims. The more meticulously detailed records submitted, the greater potentials agencies can assemble civil cases achieving criminal restitution. so collect and preserve all evidence exposing scam techniques, weblinks, names or contact points. Although highly convincing initially, several consistent suspicious signals help reveal when tech product celebrity giveaways truly intend facilitating malicious financial theft rather than reasonable community goodwill or marketing lead generations: 1. Unsubstantiated Celebrity Endorsement Claims 2. Urgency Tactics Incentivizing Haste Over Logic 3. Account Irregularities Among Key Promoters 4. External Website Links Rerouting Followers Through Unvetted Domains 5. Mismatched Fine Print Terms Covering Monthly Subscriptions vs One-Time Voucher Payments 6. Deliberately Obscured Domain Ownership and Operational Details When celebrities magically announce extraordinary free gift opportunities tied closely incredible true stories conveniently requiring temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, rational skepticism questions whether purely hearts desires motivating such grand generosity or ulterior motives focused self-enrichment. Maintain vigilant common-sense guardrails. Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions around supposed Jennifer Aniston sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seeming to portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extraordinary MacBook giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam aiming to phish peoples’ sensitive credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free. No reputable evidence supports the famous actress has ever facilitated any such laptop contests. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely showing Jennifer Aniston endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, external portal pages mimic official Apple branding alongside urges creating urgency to compel desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering product shipment. And fake customer testimonials create “herd mentality” assumption it must prove legitimate if many others already participated successfully before. No rational reason exists reasonably explaining why a celebrity would gift total strangers thousand dollar laptops simply for covering minor shipping and handling logistics alone. It defies logical assumptions. While certainly possible in coordinated future marketing campaigns, supposed existing viral MacBook contests fronted by Ms. Aniston instead represent third-party scam attempts trying to abuse public goodwill towards subtly advancing personal agendas causing harm. Despite flashy incentives promising free MacBook laptops to lucky social media followers attempting order processes, victims never receive devices. However, buried terms disclose signing up for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable single shipment fees. Those discovering unauthorized charges or services appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity tech giveaways should first notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions, shutdown compromised account access then report details to appropriate government and consumer protection groups exposing shady business practices. The supposed Jennifer Aniston-gifted MacBook giveaway sweeping social media demonstrates another cautionary example why reasonable skepticism remains so crucial navigating today’s riskier online waters promising extraordinary free gifts wrapped too perfectly almost be true. What seems incredible likely is until proper independent verification completed first. Don’t compromise personal information or finances chasing irrational social media opportunities down rabbit holes detached from reality. Apply critical thought before acting. And warn others similarly avoiding unnecessary troubles initially inspired by hope beyond reason. If extraordinary marketing gifted celebrities offerings appear flooding feeds, don’t assume automatic honesty or accuracy. Deductive logic and externally validated proof separates intents aimed self-enrichment from genuine goodwill.

Scrutinize these indicators TikTok videos likely intend socially engineering increased MacBook scam participation: When grand opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good be true often is. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites to help lend credibility justifying later requests for personal user information. Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate Apple’s iconic branding without legal rights or permissions. Logos, product images and even pricing copies real MacBook listings aiming to dupe visitors initially believing observation legitimate authorized retailer online storefronts. Another effective tactic giving the illusion of third-party endorsement involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes praising the epic giveaway values. But scrutinizing these message statements against credible media archives reveals no records correlating to actual endorsement press releases. For example, sites proclaim: “I absolutely love my rose gold MacBook Air for streaming ‘The Morning Show’ from anywhere!” says attributed Jennifer Aniston quote. “So excited watch fans unbox their very own new laptops TikTok this holiday season after entering our biggest tech giveaway ever!” But misinforming visitors intends lowering guard requesting financial disclosures rather than transparency reasonably offering extravagant free gifts in exchange for little. While flashy incentives prompt acting before thoroughly reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages disclose victims registering for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges rather than one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus giveaways. Finally, running themes across scam websites stay hiding the true controlling parties through obscuring domain registration data behind proxy site ownership protections rather than providing visible legitimate business details. So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected celebrity status tempt likelihood engagement, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages. Remain empowered spotting past emotional hooks and facade obscuring ulterior motives. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting seemingly legitimate giveaways or free trials, here are proactive next steps: Contact any credit card, debit card or digital wallet providers tied to scam payments alerting them you discovered an appliance scam scheme falsely claiming celebrity endorsement used as pretext enabling undisclosed monthly account charges without consent. Inform them this violates expected giveaway terms outlined involving only reasonable one-time voucher shipment-related costs. Ask urgently about launching fraud disputes and request provisional reimbursements until resolved. Supply details on the offending business names, domains or parent companies behind recurring charges. Follow their guidance strengthening cases demonstrating damages incurred under demonstrably deceptive pretenses. Collect customer service contact information from monthly billing statements tied to scam services and subscriptions. Call each provider clearly revoking any past payment authorization now aware those were based on false representations and predatory concealment rather than reasonable sweepstakes disclosure terms initially pitched. Record confirmation details should charges inexplicably continue. Since compromised sensitive information remains exploited repeatedly, immediately update passwords, security answers and enable stronger multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible across pertinent logins. Additionally, update contact email addresses and phone numbers previously provided fraudsters. Turn on credit monitoring services alerting suspicious activities and consider proactive bureau notifyers or credit freezes as well limiting potential exacerbated cases identity theft result these data breaches. File reports about all offending companies and scam portals with both government and third-party consumer protection groups like the Federal Trade Commission, FBI Cybercrime Division or Internet Crime Complaint Center documenting damages incurred under demonstrably false pretenses. Such filings support investigating the broader interstate patterns of repeat offenders ultimately improving outcomes and recovery options for all negatively affected victims. The more meticulously detailed records submitted, the greater potentials agencies can assemble civil cases achieving criminal restitution. so collect and preserve all evidence exposing scam techniques, weblinks, names or contact points. Although highly convincing initially, several consistent suspicious signals help reveal when tech product celebrity giveaways truly intend facilitating malicious financial theft rather than reasonable community goodwill or marketing lead generations: 1. Unsubstantiated Celebrity Endorsement Claims 2. Urgency Tactics Incentivizing Haste Over Logic 3. Account Irregularities Among Key Promoters 4. External Website Links Rerouting Followers Through Unvetted Domains 5. Mismatched Fine Print Terms Covering Monthly Subscriptions vs One-Time Voucher Payments 6. Deliberately Obscured Domain Ownership and Operational Details When celebrities magically announce extraordinary free gift opportunities tied closely incredible true stories conveniently requiring temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, rational skepticism questions whether purely hearts desires motivating such grand generosity or ulterior motives focused self-enrichment. Maintain vigilant common-sense guardrails. Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions around supposed Jennifer Aniston sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seeming to portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extraordinary MacBook giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam aiming to phish peoples’ sensitive credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free. No reputable evidence supports the famous actress has ever facilitated any such laptop contests. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely showing Jennifer Aniston endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, external portal pages mimic official Apple branding alongside urges creating urgency to compel desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering product shipment. And fake customer testimonials create “herd mentality” assumption it must prove legitimate if many others already participated successfully before. No rational reason exists reasonably explaining why a celebrity would gift total strangers thousand dollar laptops simply for covering minor shipping and handling logistics alone. It defies logical assumptions. While certainly possible in coordinated future marketing campaigns, supposed existing viral MacBook contests fronted by Ms. Aniston instead represent third-party scam attempts trying to abuse public goodwill towards subtly advancing personal agendas causing harm. Despite flashy incentives promising free MacBook laptops to lucky social media followers attempting order processes, victims never receive devices. However, buried terms disclose signing up for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable single shipment fees. Those discovering unauthorized charges or services appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity tech giveaways should first notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions, shutdown compromised account access then report details to appropriate government and consumer protection groups exposing shady business practices. The supposed Jennifer Aniston-gifted MacBook giveaway sweeping social media demonstrates another cautionary example why reasonable skepticism remains so crucial navigating today’s riskier online waters promising extraordinary free gifts wrapped too perfectly almost be true. What seems incredible likely is until proper independent verification completed first. Don’t compromise personal information or finances chasing irrational social media opportunities down rabbit holes detached from reality. Apply critical thought before acting. And warn others similarly avoiding unnecessary troubles initially inspired by hope beyond reason. If extraordinary marketing gifted celebrities offerings appear flooding feeds, don’t assume automatic honesty or accuracy. Deductive logic and externally validated proof separates intents aimed self-enrichment from genuine goodwill.

,,Unveiling the Deceptive Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam,"                    Updated on Feb 17,2024  In today's digital age, scams and fraudulent activities have become increasingly prevalent. From phishing emails to fake online giveaways, it's important to stay vigilant and aware of the tactics scammers employ. One such scam that has gained traction is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway. In this article, we will delve into the details of this deceptive scheme, uncover the tactics used to trick unsuspecting users, and shed light on the role of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram in promoting such scams. So, let's dive in and unravel the truth behind this elaborate ruse. The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a scam that claims to offer lucky participants the chance to obtain a MacBook Pro for just $2. However, this supposed ""giveaway"" is nothing more than a ploy to trick people into parting with their money. The scam typically begins with an enticing advertisement featuring Jennifer Aniston's image and false claims of being the ""largest MacBook Pro giveaway in the world."" To claim the prize, users are instructed to click on a link provided. The scammers behind the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway employ deceptive tactics to lure unsuspecting users into their trap. One such tactic is the use of deepfake technology to create realistic lip movements in the video advertisement. This further enhances the illusion and makes it difficult for users to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent content. Additionally, the scammers often use popular celebrity endorsements, like Kelly Clarkson, to give their scams a sense of legitimacy. It is disheartening to note that platforms like Facebook and Instagram, owned by Meta, have played a significant role in enabling scams and fraudulent activities. Despite claiming to be serious about combating scams, these platforms continue to accept advertisements from scammers, prioritizing profits over user safety. Their lax approach to ad review and acceptance of money from anyone has made it easier for scammers to reach a wider audience and perpetrate their deceitful schemes. It is essential to clarify that Jennifer Aniston has no involvement in the MacBook Pro Giveaway scam. Her image and likeness are being used without permission to deceive unsuspecting users. The scammers behind this scheme capitalize on her popularity and fame to make their scam appear more credible and enticing. Jennifer Aniston is likely completely unaware of her association with this fraudulent activity. One of the key tactics employed by scammers in this scheme is the concealment of hidden subscription charges. Users who click on the advertisement are directed to a website where they are prompted to answer a series of questions. Upon completion, they are informed that they have won the MacBook Pro. However, buried within the terms and conditions lies the revelation that participants are agreeing to pay a substantial amount of $29.97 as a guaranteed placement fee, which is far from the initially advertised $2 price. Scammers rely on users' tendencies to overlook terms and conditions to trap them in their deceptive scheme. In the case of the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, the terms and conditions state that participants willingly agree to pay the aforementioned placement fee of $29.97. Unfortunately, many users fail to read the fine print, leading them to believe they have won a valuable prize when, in reality, they have unwittingly signed up for an expensive subscription. The initial allure of obtaining a MacBook Pro for only $2 quickly dissipates as the true cost of the scam reveals itself. Participants are not only misled into paying a large placement fee but also find themselves enrolled in a monthly subscription service, where additional charges may be levied. The lack of transparency in the advertisement and the intentionally convoluted terms and conditions serve to exploit users' trust and maximize the scammers' profits. The prevalence of scams like the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway underscores the urgency for social media platforms to adopt stricter moderation policies and regulations. Manual review processes and capable moderators should be employed to evaluate and remove fraudulent advertisements promptly. Only by taking proactive measures to combat scams can these platforms ensure the safety and trust of their users. In conclusion, the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a deceptive scam aimed at manipulating users into paying exorbitant fees under the false pretense of winning a valuable prize. The advertisement tactics, Facebook and Instagram's complicity, and the hidden subscription charges all contribute to the success of this fraudulent scheme. It is crucial for users to remain vigilant and skeptical when presented with such enticing offers, always taking the time to thoroughly read the terms and conditions. With increased moderation and user awareness, we can collectively strive to protect against these scams and create a safer digital landscape. Q1: Is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway legitimate? A1: No, it is a deceptive scam that tricks users into paying hidden fees. Q2: How do scammers use celebrity endorsements in their scams? A2: Scammers use celebrities' images and likeness without permission to make their scams appear more legitimate. Q3: Are Facebook and Instagram complicit in promoting scams? A3: Yes, their lax moderation policies allow scammers to advertise on their platforms. Q4: Is Jennifer Aniston aware of her association with the scam? A4: No, Jennifer Aniston is likely completely unaware of her image being used in the scam. Q5: How can users protect themselves from such scams? A5: Users should be skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true, carefully read terms and conditions, and report any suspicious advertisements or scams they encounter.

,,Don’t Fall for the Fake Apple MacBook Giveaway Scam Stealing Money,"Written by: Thomas Orsolya Published on: December 20, 2023 A fraudulent online campaign falsely claiming Apple is gifting free MacBook laptops to random social media users has infiltrated platforms through manipulated advertisements and questionable external websites. However, the supposed giveaway actually intends stealing personal information and money rather than reasonable contest generosity or inventory liquidation. This article exposes the deceitful scam strategies step-by-step alongside guidance protecting yourself from potential damages. This Article Contains: The increasingly common, yet fake, Apple MacBook giveaway scam starts by circulating online ads featuring exciting headlines like: “Apple is offering 1 MacBook per household in US after a lawsuit over misleading advertising prices. Answer a few questions to check if you qualify and fill out a form to get yours delivered.” Hopeful social media users then click embedded links or tap targeted advertisements expecting official Apple contest pages. However, redirects route victims through a series of elaborate external phishing websites like “inducive.info” and”topwinnersofficial.com” completely unassociated with Apple. Decoy portal pages prominently display reputable news site logos like Fox, CNN or People Magazine alongside Apple imagery. This aims lending initial legitimacy justifying later requests for sensitive personal information rather than raising skepticism. Website headers blare: “Apple Partners With Marketplaces For Unbelievable MacBook Giveaway! Up To 100% Off!” After scrolling through fake inventory liquidation cover stories and customer testimonials, visitors eventually reach customized order forms promising delivery of free laptops solely pending small $6.95 upfront shipping/handling fees. However, buried fine print passages encased within lengthy terms and conditions associated with order forms actually bind victims to expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than one-time voucher payments expected. In the end, high value Apple products are never dispatched to filling contest entries. But victims’ compromised information enables scammers inflicting financial damages through underground dark web data sale channels. The fraudulent Apple MacBook giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims systematically through the following deceptive process: The scam starts by circulating fake ads across social platforms urgently insisting Apple urgently liquidates inventory through unbelievable deals benefiting random followers upgrading devices essentially free. Clicking on social media links or videos reroutes viewers outside platforms to elaborate phishing portal pages like “foxlimiteds.com” impersonating trusted news brands. These feature Apple’s iconic logo and imagery while deploying additional manipulation triggers overcoming initial skepticism. False inventory liquidation narratives lend believable context rationalizing extraordinary free device offers tied to reasonable request small $6.95 delivery reimbursements giving the deal perceived credibility. Fake customer reviews and claims of extreme limited supply bypass critical thinking and compel desired actions reactively seeking scarce free goods rather than questioning abnormalities. When visitors attempt securing devices through order forms, questions conveniently require private input they’d never normally provide random third-parties. Buried terms and conditions disclosures reveal victims actually consent steep recurring monthly charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time product voucher costs estimated around $10. With access to compromised confidential information, recurring credit charges activate alongside potentials for reselling data through unregulated dark web channels – each inflicting long-term damages through manipulation or identity theft. In summary, the fake celebrity MacBook giveaway ensnares social media users through emotional manipulation, urgency triggers, and concealed terms disclosing alternative money-making objectives unrelated to reasonably donation expensive electronics. The supposed Apple MacBook giveaway flows through platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated content and psychological tactics deceiving users. Let’s review what signals commonly expose the questionable laptop promotion on each network. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common deception indicators: For example, video spots insisting Jennifer Aniston helped secure Apple device gifts deserves reasonable skepticism before sharing or clicking. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to free MacBook offers: Specifically, any Instagram account using an edited video of Tim Cook promising to giveaway MacBooks deserves reasonable vetting before proceeding. Apply extra scrutiny towards viral TikTok spots exhibiting these problems: If you spot oddly persuasive videos diverting outside links or caution throws aside chasing extraordinary free gifts, trust instinct and independently verify authenticity. Across all social channels, supposed celebrity and brand affiliated opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good often is until proven otherwise. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites helping lend credibility and justifying later requests for sensitive personal user information. Let’s review several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate respected news authorities by featuring established media logos like Fox News, CNN or People Magazine without permission. This tactic eases initial skepticism by assuming previous journalistic review for authenticity. Scammers interweave elaborate fake narratives around supply chain issues, discontinued products or settlement deals justifying extraordinary free device offers and reasonable requests for minor shipping reimbursements. But further scrutiny exposes contradictions challenging legitimacy. Sprinkled throughout the hype, suspicious accounts with very limited platform histories lend perceived credibility implying they successfully participated by securing heavily discounted or free MacBook laptops themselves already. But their manufactured advocacy aims lowering skepticism guards for improved scam conversion rates. While prominent graphics prompt urgent participation scarcely reviewing rules, buried terms disclosures reveal victims registering for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time coupon shipment fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrate intention eliciting finances deceptively versus transparency. In summary, unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected brands require cautious inspection empowering individuals avoiding preventable privacy and financial damages. Look past emotional hooks and facades allowing objective logic reveal ulterior motives obscured from plain view by scammers. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting questionable giveaways, immediately take action: Contact banking providers regarding recent Apple scam discovery tied to unexpected account charges from organizations lacking proper authorization. Ask about fraud investigation and provisional reimbursements during disputes. Collect customer service information from deceptive monthly billing statements. Call providers clearly revoking any past payment authorizations now aware those were obtained under false pretenses rather than reasonable giveaway terms pitched initially. Record confirmation details should charges persist. Since compromised information retains lasting vulnerabilities, immediately update passwords and security answers while enabling robust multi-factor authentication across logins. Turn on credit monitoring alerting suspicious activities requiring quick intervention as well. File detailed reports about scam portals, product claims and damages incurred under false pretenses with both government and third-party consumer protection groups. Such filings support investigating repeat offenders warranting legal intervention assisting all negatively impacted victims. Several consistent red flags help reveal when a too-good-to-be-true viral MacBook deal likely intends facilitating financial theft rather than contest generosity: 1. Unauthorized Branding Use Without Attribution 2. Situational Urgency Tactics Encouraging Haste 3. Disproportionate Requested Fees 4. Comment Irregularities 5. Restricted External Website Disclosures Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions regarding supposed Apple sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring exciting inventory liquidation narratives and video footage seeming to show Apple leadership endorsing giveaways, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam effort aiming to phish peoples’ credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free to random individuals. No reputable evidence supports Apple facilitating any such laptop contests recently. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely depicting Apple executives like Tim Cook endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, elaborate external portal pages mimic news authority branding alongside urgency cues directed encouraging desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions disclosures also bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering one-time product shipment costs estimated around $10.

,,YouTube scam features fake Jennifer Aniston," The latest in celebrity-impersonating scams, a deepfake of Jennifer Aniston promoting a “MacBook giveaway,” is going viral over how convincing it is. The deepfake of actor Jennifer Aniston promoting a YouTube scam is circulating online, fuelling concern over how quickly such videos are becoming better in quality and more common. A post on Reddit has been upvoted thousands of times, with hundreds of comments discussing the latest technology-facilitated attempt to fool those gullible enough to believe it. While many agreed the video had plenty of tell-tale signs of being fake – from bizarre facial expressions to lip movements not entirely matching what was being said – others voiced apprehension at the increasing quality of such scams. “The scam itself isn’t good at all and still obvious (even if they paid the real Jennifer Aniston to say it, lol), but the technology behind it is getting so good so fast,” the original poster’s message read. “It says a lot that the video and audio aren’t the most suspicious thing, it’s the poor writing quality/grammar. Absolutely crazy,” it continued. Others noted that none of the red flags were making the scam less effective. “These exact scams have been around for 20+ years. We keep seeing them because they work. If they didn't work, scammers would do something else,” one user said. “Most people can spot them a mile away, but the ones that can't are the ones that get caught up in it. They're obviously the targets,” they added. Commenters also noted that the video was good enough to circumvent a detection algorithm used by YouTube’s parent company, Google, and that the artificial intelligence technology behind it was now widely available to anyone. “The next decade is going to be interesting,” the top comment on the thread said. In the video, Jennifer Aniston's likeness promotes an age-old “giveaway” scam. It tells viewers that “if you’re watching this video, you’re one of the 10,000 lucky people who will get a MacBook Pro for just $10.” The user is then urged to follow a link and claim their device in the ""world’s largest MacBook giveaway.” The likeness of Taylor Swift was also used earlier this month to promote a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway on Facebook and TikTok, capitalizing on the fact that the singer is an actual fan of the luxury French brand. In October last year, a similar scam campaign featuring popular YouTuber MrBeast emerged online, while the likeness of actor Tom Hanks was used in a dental plan ad without his consent.

,,Beware: Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway Scam Exposed!,"                    Updated on Feb 17,2024  Table of Contents: In today's digital age, scams and fraudulent activities have become rampant, targeting unsuspecting individuals across various platforms. One such scam is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, which promises the opportunity to obtain a MacBook Pro for just $2. However, this scheme preys on people's desire to own expensive gadgets at an unbelievably low price. In this article, we will delve into the details of this scam, exposing its deceptive tactics and hidden subscription charges. The online world is filled with enticing offers and giveaways that claim to provide users with extravagant prizes, often at unbelievable prices. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and cautious, especially when an offer seems too good to be true. The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a prime example of such a scam. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are commonly exploited by scammers to reach a large audience. Jennifer Aniston's image and likeness are used without permission to promote the fraudulent MacBook Pro giveaway. These ads, often accompanied by fake photos and misleading claims, lure unsuspecting users into clicking the link to claim their prize. It is disheartening to see that Facebook and Instagram, despite claiming to take scams seriously, continue to accept money from scammers to run these deceptive ads. Their profit-driven approach prioritizes investors' satisfaction over the well-being and protection of their users from such scams. Upon clicking the ad, users are redirected to a fake website, such as Droidgiveaway.info or SLmacb0000K2PB.index.php. These websites aim to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, stating that only a limited number of MacBooks are available. However, these claims are far from the truth. The scammers employ various phishing tactics to extract personal information from users. They typically ask users to answer a few questions or provide their details under the guise of being a ""giveaway winner."" It is important to note that these tactics are solely designed to deceive and manipulate users into divulging their information. As users progress through the process, they finally reach a point where hidden subscription charges come into play. The scammers demand a payment of $29.97 for a ""guaranteed placement in the contest to win."" This sudden shift from a seemingly inexpensive offer to a significant payment catches users off guard. The lack of transparency regarding these charges is alarming. By burying this information deep within the terms and conditions, the scammers intentionally attempt to deceive users and maximize their own profits. The terms and conditions are often overlooked by users, especially when presented with an exciting opportunity like winning a MacBook Pro. However, it is crucial to read the fine print carefully. In the case of the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, the terms and conditions reveal the true nature of the scam. Buried within the text is a clause that states the user will be entering into a subscription and agreeing to pay monthly fees. The scammers intentionally hide this information to ensure users remain unaware of the recurring charges they will incur. One of the key elements of this scam is the hidden monthly fees associated with a ""subscribe and save"" membership. By signing up for the contest under false pretenses, users unknowingly commit to paying these recurring charges. This deceptive tactic allows scammers to continue profiting off unsuspecting victims. When participating in these scams, users are often required to provide personal information, including their name, email address, and even payment details. The lack of transparency and clear indication of how this data will be used raises serious privacy concerns. It is important to exercise caution when sharing personal information online, especially with unknown sources. Scammers can exploit this data for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or unauthorized financial transactions. To safeguard yourself from falling victim to scams like the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, it is essential to adopt a cautious approach. Here are a few tips to help protect yourself: The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a clear example of the dangers that lurk in the digital landscape. Scammers exploit people's desire for exclusive deals and prizes, using deceptive tactics and hidden charges to profit at the expense of unsuspecting individuals. It is crucial to remain vigilant, question suspicious offers, and prioritize your online safety. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.

,,"Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez giveaway videos are deepfake scams","        Videos have recently been shared widely across social media claiming to show various celebrities hosting giveaways.  Jennifer Aniston in one video appears to be giving away Apple MacBooks. Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez are among the celebrities who appear to be advertising Le Creuset cookware.  But those videos don’t actually show the celebrities themselves. They are deepfakes likely created with some form of artificial intelligence (AI) software. People online sharing these videos say these videos are a scam, and the AI used to create it is getting better. VERIFY is here to help prevent you from falling victim to these types of celebrity scams with tips to help you spot AI. There are several types of manipulated videos that can spread false information. Two of the most common are deepfakes and shallowfakes. A deepfake video is made using artificial intelligence technologies, like programs that can be used to replace or synthesize faces, speech or expressions of emotions. Shallowfakes are created using simple video editing software; scammers make basic edits to combine or alter existing videos. In the examples we found of celebrities appearing to be giving away items, those are deepfakes created with the intention of scamming people into providing personal or financial information. When we reverse image searched a screenshot from the Jennifer Aniston MacBook giveaway video, we found it was actually created using a video published by the Wall Street Journal. The original video is a clip from an interview Aniston did in August 2023 about her career – she was not giving away MacBooks. The Selena Gomez giveaway deepfake was created using an interview between Gomez and fashion magazine Vogue about her fashion looks over the years, not LeCruset cookware.  Everything in the real and fake videos match, except for the words being said. If you see a celebrity ad or endorsement and wonder if it was made using AI, here are some tips that can help you identify AI and avoid falling for the scam. Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter! 1. How to spot a deepfake Here are questions to ask yourself when determining whether a video is real or fake: The MIT Media Lab, a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers these tips to help detect deepfakes: 2. Conduct a reverse image search Celebrities are regularly caught on camera, interviewed or photographed, so deepfakes are typically created using a real video the celebrity appeared in. If you conduct a reverse image search of a keyframe or screenshot from the video, you’ll likely  find the original video that was used to create the deepfake.  To conduct a reverse image search through Google using your computer, follow these steps: Google also has guides on reverse image searching from your iPhone or Android device.  RevEye is a browser extension you can install that also allows you to conduct a reverse image search by right-clicking any image online. A website called TinEye also allows you to upload an image from your computer to find where it has appeared online.  3. Examine the link before you click If a link looks suspicious, you can hover your mouse over it to see where the hyperlink will actually take you, a guide on online safety from Stony Brook University says. For example, if the message comes from someone claiming to be from one company, but the link you’re hovering over goes to a different website, that’s suspicious.  Boston University’s IT department says to use common sense and ask yourself: “Does a website look strange to you? Is it asking for sensitive personal information? If it looks unsafe, don't take the risk.” “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Is the website offering you a product or service at an unheard of price? Or maybe they are promising you a huge return on investment? If the offer looks too good to be true, trust your instincts. Do some research to find reviews or warnings from other users,” Boston University’s website says.  If the suspicious site’s URL isn’t the same as the official website of the brand being endorsed, that’s a red flag. Avoid clicking on it, and if you do, don’t enter any personal information. Here are some tips to consider before you click on any link. The University of Denver Information Security Department says to take a look at the web address, or URL, itself for these common red flags:  VERIFY reached out to Meta for comment on these deepfake scams and did not hear back at the time of publication.

,,Fact-Check: Is Jennifer Aniston Macbook Giveaway 2023 Real?,"SabiReviews Verified Reviews From Scam Detector Sorry to burst your bubbles, the Jennifer Anitson Macbook giveaway posts you see on social media is NOT Real. It’s a deepfake video created with AI to scam people off their credit card details.     Please enable JavaScript    At the order page for the Macbook, instead of the $2 shipping fee, you would be tricked into a subscription scam. The Terms & Conditions written in small prints says ”You’ll be charged a one time charge of $119 at checkout ” Instead of a free Macbook, victims of this scam would get charged $119 for a shady subscription plan, and wouldn’t receive any Macbook. SCAM GIVEAWAY! Table of Contents The scam uses a deep fake generated video of Jennifer Anitson. A close look at the video shows the audio and facial expression don’t match. This is quite common with deepfake videos. Pay attention to blinking and the lip movements. It doesn’t look natural On the comment section of the fake giveaway posts there are comments and reviews from people posing as winners. However, the profiles are fake and the reviews were scripted to make people believe the giveaway is real. When you go to pay for the $2 shipping fee, there are tiny letters in the checkout page which says you’re subscribing to a service and would get debited for some amount of money monthly. After paying for shipping, you wouldn’t receive the prize or get any tracking number, rather you will receive unauthorised charges on your credit card. Aside from subscribing you to a phoney service, this scam also steals your sensitive data like your credit card number and name when you pay for shipping. This information is then sold to the dark web and used to commit different kinds of fraudulent activities. The first thing you should do is contact your bank to inform them about the fraudulent subscription. Through the chargeback system, you can get your money back from the transaction if you file a dispute claim. Since you unknowingly subscribed for a service which you can’t trace, it’d be best if you ditch the credit card and get a new one. That way you wouldn’t get charged for the subscription again. The second step you should take is updating your passwords. This should be done if you’ve used the same password you used on other websites or applications. You should also go an extra step of enabling two-factor authentication. This would keep you protected from data breech. There’s a likelihood that your device has been infested by malware or spyware after visiting the site. Scanning your device with a malware removal tool will detect and remove any viruses, spyware, or other malicious programs. See best malware device tools here The first step you should take is finding out if the giveaway has been posted on the company’s social media accounts. If it hasn’t, the giveaway is likely a scam. Legit giveaways don’t ask for any kind of fee, whether shipping or handling fee. Scan the giveaway post. Do you notice bad grammar, missing words, or spelling mistakes? These are red flags for a scam. Any company can make a minor mistake when typing out a win notification. However, multiple or glaring errors are a bad sign. Are there reviews or posts about the giveaway online? It’s common for various news outlet to carry information about legit giveaways. By searching for reviews online you could also come across warning posts or complaints. The Jennifer Anitson Macbook giveaway 2023 is not real. It’s a scam orchestrated by fraudsters whose aim is to steal people’s personal and financial information. The videos used by this scam was generated with Artificial intelligence.

,,Apple TV+ to Hollywood A-Listers: “Come Get Your Free iPhone!”,"  BY LAURA BRADLEY Imagine for a moment, if you please, offering Oprah Winfrey a free iPhone. What would the billionaire who has famously showered her fans in diamond watches and Volkswagens say when asked, “Which style iPhone would you prefer?” Would she raise an eyebrow? Stifle a chuckle? Counter by offering you a free MacBook Pro? According to a new dispatch from the Hollywood Reporter, Apple has basically been doing just that, offering each showrunner and series regular—a club that includes A-listers Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Winfrey—a free Apple product. Per THR, Apple has “dispatched representatives to the sets of shows including Dickinson to take orders from talent on which style iPhone or iPad they’d prefer.” Apple has clearly brought a lot of money for its entry into original programming, but thus far it hasn’t been enough to mask some behind-the-scenes shake-ups. Multiple series—including the Aniston- and Witherspoon-starring Morning Show and the Steven Spielberg anthology show, Amazing Stories—have seen showrunner swaps. Apple’s development executives, meanwhile, have been a fixture on some sets as the company tries to ensure its programming stays in line with the brand overall. (As THR notes, a recent BuzzFeed report alleges the company also told its showrunners to avoid offending China.) Some bumps are to be expected whenever a company first tries dipping its toe into the Hollywood pool—but Apple’s bid for eyeballs has proven particularly costly, raising the stakes for a company that, by its own TV+ strategist’s admission, “[doesn’t] know anything about making television.” For instance: THR reports that Morning Show costs $15 million to make per episode. Witherspoon and Aniston are each making $2 million per episode, with the show’s two seasons costing Apple $300 million total. The company’s per-month subscription rate, meanwhile, is a mere $5—one of the lowest of all the upcoming streaming platforms, perhaps because Apple TV+ will have no library content, instead focusing solely on originals. That means 60 million would have to sign up for a month of service for Morning Show to break even, though given Apple’s plan to offer a free year of the service to anyone who purchases a select Apple product, operating at a loss for a while is clearly not a huge concern for the company worth $1 trillion. As THR notes, Apple TV+ could, if successful, boost revenue for the company’s services division—meaning, basically, the non-hardware offerings including Apple Music, Apple News, and iCloud—which the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in 2016 that he aimed to double by 2020. That said, one expert seemed skeptical when speaking with THR: As the director of the USC Annenberg Center for the Digital Future, Jeffrey Cole, put it, “Apple has an innovation crisis. Entertainment is one of their attempts to do something innovative, but they’re just dabbling.” Would Apple Produce a Show like Game of Thrones? — Apple learns from one of Netflix’s biggest mistakes

Your best defense is your own caution – protect yourself from these digital wolves in sheep’s clothing! If you have been deceived by the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam, it is crucial to promptly safeguard yourself and your finances. Follow these steps to mitigate the impact of the scam and protect your assets: Symptoms: The unwanted application can cause several adverse effects, such as displaying intrusive pop-up ads and slowing down internet browsing. The threat can manipulate the settings of an internet browser. This manipulation forces users to visit the hijacker’s website and conduct internet searches using their search engine. Distribution: Browser hijackers or adware such as Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam can spread through deceptive pop-up ads, free software installers that are bundled with malware, and fake Flash Player installers. Removal: To remove the threat, scan your system with powerful SpyHunter anti-malware software  The purpose of adware or browser hijacker is to generate revenue through targeted advertising. It collects user data, such as browsing habits and preferences, to deliver personalized ads. By bombarding users with ads, the unwanted program aims to increase the chances of users clicking on them, leading to potential revenue for its developers. While adware is primarily an annoyance and can compromise user privacy, it is often a means for companies to monetize free software and services without directly charging users. The primary objective of a browser hijacker is to promote certain websites, generate traffic, and potentially earn revenue through advertising or other means by exploiting the user’s browsing experience without their consent.  Devices can fall victim to browser hijackers or adware through the download of infected files, malevolent email attachments, or visits to compromised websites. These hijacking tools may be bundled within browser extensions or included as part of software packages. Additionally, browser based threats can stem from shareware, freeware, or spyware infections, further expanding their potential sources of origin. Potentially unwanted programs like Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam often find their way onto users’ devices unintentionally, as users can be deceived into unknowingly downloading them. This can occur when users agree to an extra download mentioned in the terms and conditions of software installation. Another tactic involves misleading users with a choice to decline the installation of the browser hijacker software, but the wording deliberately confuses them, resulting in the inadvertent download. Once installed, PUP initiates its malicious actions by manipulating the user’s browser activities through embedded malevolent code.  Browser hijacking refers to the unauthorized modification of web browser’s settings or behavior by malicious software or websites.  It can have various impacts on users and their browsing experience. Here are some common impacts of browser hijacking:  This undesirable application can cause instability in web browsers by modifying critical settings, introducing incompatible software, or consuming system resources. Users may experience frequent crashes, slow performance, or unresponsiveness while browsing. In more severe cases, browsing hijacking can lead to unauthorized access to online accounts. PUPs may attempt to steal login credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data, putting users at risk of identity theft or fraud. Furthermore, browser hijacking can be a part of a larger malware infection. In such cases, adware or hijacker may serve as a gateway for other malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or spyware, further compromising the user’s system and data. Also, browser-based threats with data collection abilities can cause severe problems. They can gather sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal details, leading to identity theft and fraud. The collected data may also be sold to third parties, compromising user privacy. Additionally, targeted advertising based on the collected information can result in a flood of intrusive and potentially malicious ads.

,,That viral Facebook post about Jen Aniston is fake,"It appears the same fandom that inspired that homeless Richard Gere post has now got Jennifer Aniston. Richard Gere: About that pic of me homeless... On Tuesday, a community page shared this heartwarming story of a chance encounter between Aniston and a supposedly pregnant, homeless 15-year-old in Vancouver:   “The post is a fake,” a rep for Jennifer Aniston confirmed to USA TODAY. “Jennifer is not on any social media platforms.” The riveting tale, which has since been shared more than 70,000 times, was actually lifted from this Reddit thread, which asked, ""What is the nicest thing you've ever done that no one knows about?"" What is the nicest thing you've ever done that no one knows about? * /r/AskReddit It appears the community fan page changed minor details and – in a shocking twist – has acknowledged at the very, very bottom of the post that ""this story is not related to any celebrity and the person in the picture is just a wonderful fan and it's not related to her but a story worth sharing! #SpreadPositivityInTheWorld"" While the post may have been well-intentioned, we're thinking that maybe attributing false stories to A-list celebrities isn't the way to promote kindness.

,,Would you buy a laptop from Jennifer Aniston? Inside Apple’s product placement machine,"Apple once made sure its iPhones and MacBooks were seen on screen very sparingly. Then The Morning Show and Ted Lasso came along Ted Lasso, the sweetest guy on television, is trying to sell you stuff. In one episode of the eponymous comedy series about a feel-good football manager, Apple products feature 36 times. Ted talks on his iPhone, natters over FaceTime, sends emails with his MacBook Air. He doesn’t quite prostrate himself before an effigy of the late Steve Jobs but you get the idea.  Much the same experience is served up by Apple TV+’s other big hit, The Morning Show, which returns Friday for a second season. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon spend enormous chunks of their screen time with iPhones clamped to their ears or whispering sweet-nothings to their MacBooks.  The show is ostensibly about behind-the-scenes back-stabbing on American breakfast TV. Yet at a more fundamental level it’s a celebration of shiny and expensive kit – all brought to you by the corporation that invented luxury minimalism.  As often as not these products appear in what experts call the “fifth quadrant”: the square bang in the centre of the screen that is usually the focus of viewer attention. And not that anyone needs to be told this, but all of that Ted Talk on the iPhone confirms Lasso as the hero. Apple doesn’t allow villains to be shown using its products. As Knives Out director Rian Johnson revealed several years, ago if you see a character in an Apple show speaking into a non-branded phone, you can take it they’re the villain. This actually happens in season one of The Morning Show, in which Billy Crudup’s unsavoury father is depicted using an Android-type device. What a monster.  So ferocious is Apple’s product placement it steamrolls on even when the actual products are out of sight. Whenever someone on The Morning Show receives a text or email, they are alerted via that tell-tale iOS notification. The effect is truly relentless: a Wall Street Journal analysis of Apple TV+ content found that, over 74 episodes of hits such as Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Trying and Defending Jacob, 300 iPhones, 120 MacBooks, and 40 pairs of AirPods were shown.  Apple’s orgy of product placement will strike some as excessive. When the company got into the TV “content” game several years ago, many in the industry heralded it as a quantum leap for home entertainment. In fact, it’s been quantum leap for Apple hawking its wares. Not that it’s really reinventing the i-wheel. Crowbarring brands into films and television is as old as the medium itself. The Lumière Brothers plugged Sunlight Soap in their silent movies. And the term “soap opera’ obviously comes from the soap brands that constantly featured in early serial dramas.  Apple has, however, always taken the digital biscuit. Its products have popped up prominently in everything from Sex and the City to Mission: Impossible (a PowerMac laptop had a starring role in the first film).  Yet especially since launching its own streaming service, the company that once hired Ridley Scott to make an ad inspired by 1984 has gone full Orwellian. In one episode of M. Night Shyamalan thriller Servant, for instance, we see a character using Apple’s FaceTime software to conduct two simultaneous conversations via iPad and through the Apple TV app. It’s like being inside Steve Jobs’ brain with no escape hatch.  That Apple TV+ would be as much about product as entertainment was made clear early on. Hollywood executives summoned to Apple’s Cupertino HQ quickly discovered that the House of Jobs was charting its own course – and had its own value system.  Apple, the suits were surprised to learn, was vague about release dates and marketing campaigns – the sort of things over which Tinsel Town traditionally obsesses. It was, though, incredibly specific about how often, and in what context, Apple products appeared on screen. “People involved… said Apple executives had expressed squeamishness when it comes to the portrayal of technology in the shows,” went a report in the New York Times. “How exactly are you using that iPhone?, Or that Mac laptop?” Apple has at least been consistent. The saturation of product placement across its original programming on Apple TV+ is extraordinary. Ted Lasso is drowning in Apple kit. In one storyline, Ted finalises his divorce by scanning the legal documents using his iPhone. And in a single four second scene of The Morning Show, nine Apple products are shown. In the first episode of the series, there are 31 shots of Apple devices – including nine of the company’s logo.  This is of course Apple’s prerogative. The corporation is reportedly pumping $15 million per episode into The Morning Show. And so it might reasonably reserve the right to showcase all the gadgets it wants.  Apple could also point out that it is hardly alone. Netflix’s recent gender-swap remake of Nineties teen comedy She’s All That – now, He’s All That – includes, for instance, placements for fast food and soft drink brands. As well as clothing websites, make-up brands and (non-Apple) computers.  A Netflix product placement is worth a lot more to corporations than a wink from Apple TV+. That’s because of the vast difference of scale in the subscriber bases. Apple TV + may work with high-profile stars such as Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, but its user numbers in the United States are estimated at just 40 million – including the many Apple customers who receive a year’s free sign-up when buying a new phone or laptop.  Netflix, by contrast, has 209 million paid subscribers. And the value of a Netflix plug can be extraordinary. A cameo in season three of Strangers Things was worth over $15 million in advertising spend to the 100 brands that featured on screen, it was estimated.  If there is a difference between Apple and Netflix it is the former’s sheer insatiability. No matter what else happens on screen, the brand must be showcased. “New Coke”, Coca Cola’s disastrous attempt at reviving its fortunes in the mid-Eighties, features prominently in Stranger Things 3. Yet this merely adds to the Spielbergian charm. In Ted Lasso, by contrast, the endless sales pitch encoded within the DNA of the script is in conflict with the show’s air of everyman optimism.  Put that down to Silicon Valley culture. Apple and peers such as Google and Facebook didn’t get where they are today by taking a softly softly approach or by asking permission at every turn.  That philosophy has been transposed wholesale and shamelessly to streaming. When the Apple comedy Mythic Quest filmed a lockdown episode, characters dialled in via FaceTime wearing Apple earbuds (apart from a villain whose headphones were concealed beneath her hair). Not even the vintage space race saga For All Mankind is exempt – a recent instalment set in the late Seventies featured the venerable Apple II computer.  Are there any limits to Apple’s campaign to turn streaming into a quasi-opaque shop window? Well, advance reports suggest there won’t be any iPhones or MacBooks in its adaptation of Isaac Asimov’s Foundation novels, set 50,000 years hence (around the time the next Game of Thrones novel comes out). Nonetheless, in the trailers the expensive sci-fi sets have a suspiciously blank, minimalist sheen – like Apple Stores in the far future. In space they may not be able to hear you scream. But if you listen carefully you can tell that they’re still trying to subliminally flog you Apple gear.

,,How Apple Finally Convinced Jennifer Aniston to Return to TV,"Toggle Dark Mode Two years ago, when Apple’s plans for what would eventually become Apple TV+ were still in their infancy, Apple’s new dynamic duo of top TV execs knew that they would need to get some high-profile content if the company’s streaming service was going to be a hit. One of their first moves after putting together Apple’s new worldwide video programming division was to boldly approach Hollywood’s Creative Arts Agency (CAA) to attempt to woo talent no less significant than Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The result was Apple’s very first original content deal, signed in November 2017 for a “morning drama series” that would later become the much-talked-about The Morning Show. While producing the new series hasn’t been without its obstacles, by the time the dust settled, Apple had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ensuring its success — more than it cost HBO to produce the entire final season of Game of Thrones. While Apple’s very deep pockets undoubtedly played a part in signing many of its higher profile content deals, there’s also no underestimating the role the company’s culture and reputation has played as well. For example, Oprah, who is already one of the wealthiest producers in Hollywood, joined forces with Apple because she believes in Apple TV+ and the audience that it can reach. Now, in a new interview with Variety, Jennifer Aniston speaks for the first time about her partnership with Apple on The Morning Show, sharing similar feelings about Apple’s culture and the work that she will be doing with them. There was really something exciting about being the first at Apple. Apple is pretty awesome. They make cool stuff. Why wouldn’t they maybe make cool television? And they are all about quality, not quantity, so that was really appealing. And in spite of their comical secrecy, it’s been worth it. Who doesn’t want to be part of the Wild Wild West? Aniston goes on to note that “even though they didn’t have walls yet or telephones” she was still excited about working with Apple, and while she had some reservations, they were minor compared to the excitement of not only working with Apple, but being the first to do so, and Aniston was confident that her production team “knew what we were doing.” In fact, if anything, it’s remarkable that Apple has been able to attract Aniston back to the small screen after an illustrious film career. Aniston’s headlining appearance in The Morning Show will be the first time she’s been on TV since her legendary role as Rachel Green in Friends made her a household name 15 years ago. There haven’t been a shortage of offers, either, with Aniston saying she’s declined many over the years out of a desire to focus on films, plus the feeling that nothing could compare with the experience she had while working on Friends. The Morning Show, however, appears to have reinvigorated this desire in Aniston, not only in terms of working with Apple, but also for the sake of the material itself. While the show was originally envisioned as simply focusing on the “cutthroat world of morning TV,” Variety notes that it was “completely rewritten” for the “Me Too” movement after Matt Lauer was fired from Today in November 2017, less than a month after Aniston inked her deal with Apple. The show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s— hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch. However, although Mitch Kessler, the disgraced anchor who will be played by Steve Carell on The Morning Show, bears some resemblances to Lauer, Aniston insists that the the show is a work of fiction. In fact, Aniston adds that while studying old episodes of Today and Good Morning America to develop her character for The Morning Show, she even re-watched Today from the day before Lauer was fired, asking herself whether he knew it was coming. I went to the DVR that I had of “Today” before Matt Lauer was fired and then the day he was fired, because that was so fascinating to see. Mitch Kessler is not based on him at all. He’s just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he’s representing. Aniston notes that she was also encouraged to return to TV by the rise of streaming services, and the amount of quality content now being produced by all of them, along with the shift of Hollywood big screen films into the Marvel universe — she says she wasn’t “really that interested in living in a green screen,” and would much rather see the “era of Meg Ryan come back” when there were more “cozy” and dramatic films showing in theatres. At the same time, Aniston reveals that she has mixed feelings about streaming, saying that she’s both “shocked” and “excited” that this is where things are at, and has been even more surprised that companies like Apple, Netflix, and WarnerMedia are putting such huge amounts of money into it, specifically citing the $80 million that the latter recently paid for the streaming rights to Friends. While Aniston has only signed on for two seasons of The Morning Show so far, she also isn’t ruling out doing a third season, as long as “there’s stuff to talk about” and they’re not “dead tired from it.” The Morning Show has understandably been one of Apple’s most-hyped new shows, and it’s expected to debut right away when Apple TV+ launches on Nov. 1, although it’s likely that only the first couple of episodes will be available at launch, with viewers needing to follow a more traditional weekly release schedule to keep up with the show.

,,Apple Bets On Jennifer Aniston And ‘The Morning Show’ For Streaming Debut,"Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon attend the Apple TV&plus;'s ""The Morning Show"" World Premiere ... [+] The Morning Show’s New York premiere had the familiar trappings of a Hollywood affair: stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon walking a carpet that stretched the length of Lincoln Center Plaza as photographers captured their arrival and onlookers gawked. A giant illuminated Apple TV+ logo signaled that this particular premiere was different. It commemorated the technology giant’s entry into the streaming wars.  The Morning Show debuts Friday on Apple TV+, one of eight original series that anchor the new streaming service. The big-budget drama, which revolves around a Matt Lauer-esque #MeToo scandal involving the male anchor of a television morning show, is the service’s marquee offering. It was one of the first shows put in motion by veteran television executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, who joined Apple in 2017 At The Morning Show’s premiere, Erlicht talked about how he and Van Amburg heard the pitch for the series on their third day on the job at Apple. PROMOTED “We knew right away this was the one,” Erlicht said, according to a recording of the presentation obtained by Forbes. “It was everything we were hoping to do. … It was a show loaded with layers and subtext, it was about something real, and honestly, it didn’t hurt that it was exec-produced and stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.” Trouble was, they didn’t know how to order paper clips for the office, let alone a series. There were no employees, no business affairs staff, no negotiators and no budget. It would take three to four months to close the deal, Erlich said, with per-episode costs that approach that of HBO’s Game of Thrones, according to one source familiar with the financing. “The negotiation was not easy. In fact I’ll say nothing about this show has been what I would describe as easy,” Erlich said. “But the great ones never are. And that’s what The Morning Show is. A great one.” Forbes Daily: Get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.    The show represents Aniston’s return to television 15 years after saying goodbye to her Emmy Award-winning portrayal as Rachel Green on Friends. Whether she and co-stars Witherspoon and Steve Carell can attract viewers to the nascent service will be an early test of Apple’s decision to build its own original slate of TV shows. The Apple TV+ service will compete for attention with newcomers Disney+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max and NBCUniversal’s Peacock. All are seeking to capitalize on the streaming phenomenon ignited by Netflix, which has amassed more than 60 million subscribers in the U.S. and even more internationally. Apple, like Amazon, is positioning its streaming service as a perquisite that supports its main business. The iPhone-maker is offering one year’s free access with the purchase of a new device (others can access it through the Apple TV app for $5 a month).   “It’s a gift to our users and, from a business point of view, we’re really proud of the content,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook during Wednesday’s investor call. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. We think it’s a bold move.” Morgan Stanley projects that Apple TV+ could become a $9 billion business by 2025 if just one out of every ten Apple user subscribes to the streaming service. That would further propel Apple’s fast-growing services business, which reported a record $12.5 billion in revenue for the September quarter. Apple has been working toward this moment for the last two years, starting with the recruitment of Erlicht and Van Amburg, who as presidents of Sony Pictures Television had developed a roster of acclaimed shows including Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad, The Crown and The Shield. Apple’s first original series, Planet of the Apps, in which entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to celebrity investors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am and Gary Vaynerchuk, took a critical drubbing as “both boring and self-indulgent.” Erlicht and Van Amburg set out in search of shows that would fit with the image Apple burnished for itself through brand-defining ad campaigns like 1997’s “Think Different” promotion, where it aligned itself with “the Crazy Ones” who changed the world—Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Amelia Earhart, Pablo Picasso.  “We believe deeply in the power of creativity,” Cook said at an event in March where the company announced Apple TV+. “Our products help people express their creativity and tell their stories, because great stories can change the world. Great stories can move us and inspire us. They can challenge our assumptions.” Apple courted world-class talent, including Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and acclaimed talk show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who would bring prestige to the service. But it was wary of themes that might offend Apple consumers, including gratuitous violence or unflattering depictions of religion, say Hollywood insiders familiar with these conversations. This fall, the tech giant scrapped a high-profile project, Bastards, in which Richard Gere was to star as one of two elderly Vietnam veterans who go on a shooting spree to avenge the death of a woman they both loved. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that Apple was worried about the show’s exploration of vigilante justice and instead urged a story line built around the vets’ enduring friendship.  Cook personally made the decision in 2016 to shut down Apple’s first scripted project, Vital Signs, a semi-autobiographical tale of its star, Dr. Dre, which contained scenes of cocaine use, a mansion orgy and gun brandishing, the Wall Street Journal reported.   But that was before Erlicht and Van Amburg took the helm and sought to build bridges in a wary Hollywood. They would have to overcome nervousness about a product that was shrouded in secrecy and grumbling over the tech giant’s tone-deaf decision in 2014 to force a free copy of the U2 album Songs of Innocence on everyone with an iTunes account, whether they wanted it or not. There have been occasional missteps.  Celebrities, studio executives and deal-makers traveled to Cupertino on a cool March morning to take part in Apple’s much anticipated launch of its subscription video service. But in a snub, major Hollywood figures who’d made the pilgrimage north—including directors Ron Moore and M. Night Shyamalan—never made it onstage.  Everyone in the room was left guessing about key details of the Apple TV+ service, including the launch date and pricing. Indeed, as Apple prepared to make its big move on Hollywood, the technology giant still clung to the rituals of a tightly controlled product launch. Even so, Apple was able to overcome these obstacles and attract big-name talent. The launch lineup of original series include For All Mankind, an alternate telling of the space race from Moore; Dickinson, a coming-of-age story featuring Hailee Steinfeld as the rebellious young poet Emily Dickinson; and See, set in the distant future, after a virus has ravaged the planet and left the survivors blind, starring Jason Momoa.

,,Apple Has Made Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon the Highest Paid TV Stars in Hollywood,"Toggle Dark Mode Apple has never held back when it’s serious about breaking into a new industry. The iPod and iTunes revolutionized the music industry, the iPhone changed the mobile phone landscape forever, and the iPad has now defined what a tablet computer is supposed to be. So not surprisingly, once Apple decided it was time to get serious about movies and TV shows, it entered Hollywood with the same confidence, boldness, and aggressiveness that the company showed with the music industry back in 2001. When Apple launched iTunes almost two decades ago, it sought out and made groundbreaking deals with every major music label, and we’ve all seen what came out of that. Now with Apple TV+ on the cusp of launching to the world, The Hollywood Reporter has shared some other interesting details on Apple’s journey to Hollywood, and the kind of money that the trillion-dollar company is wiling to put on the table to ensure that it attracts the best talent it can in order to produce the best content it possibly can. They didn’t step in halfway. They were smart to hire people who have spent their careers at the center of the TV business, and they didn’t stutter start. The report also recaps some of the early obstacles we’d already heard about with The Morning Show, along with the revelation that Apple spent $300 million on two seasons of that particular series alone, with $40 million of that going to Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who are making a negotiated $2 million each per episode simply for their starring roles — and that’s on top of what they’re also receiving as executive producers and owners of the show. This easily places Aniston and Witherspoon among the highest paid television stars in Hollywood, coming in just behind Charlie Sheen (Two and a Half Men), Ray Romano (Everybody Loves Raymond), and Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) — the only other members of the “$2 Million Club” (after adjustments for inflation are factored in). While The Morning Show also stars Steve Carrell, it appears that he’s not considered one of the main cast, and (spoiler alert!) he’s actually only got a one-year deal for the show, despite the fact that Apple has ordered two seasons of it. In fact, Apple is already reportedly searching for a new high-profile male lead to replace him in the second season. With Apple taking Hollywood by storm — making bold new deals with A-list creators such as Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg and setting up its own in-house studio — there’s every reason to expect Apple TV+ to do for television and movies what iTunes did for music. For one thing, Apple is taking the rather unique approach of going at it solely with its own staple of brand new content, rather than having a large library of licensed content to fall back on. This gives Apple the kind of independence it likes to have, and it’s a smart move in an era when everybody from Disney to Warner and NBC are setting up their own competing services and clawing back on their licensing deals anyway. Apple will be beholden to no one when it comes to the success or failure of Apple TV+. The two-way relationship they have with the consumer and the vast number of consumers they have, that’s going to be game-changing, Secondly, Apple already has a huge and loyal customer base that are already plugged into its ecosystem. This means that when Apple TV+ launches next month, most people will be able to subscribe to it with the push of a button and the scan of a face. While there have been some conflicting reports about how much Apple is actually involved in the production of each show, the Reporter indicates that there’s still a certain amount of direct involvement just to “ensure that each show fits the Apple brand.” Despite rumours that Apple was going to avoid risqué content and stay “family friendly,” this seems to be more about ensuring that whatever a show is doing fits the story that Apple wants to tell. For example, The Morning Show doesn’t shy away from using adult language and situations, but Apple clearly feels that explicit and edgy content shouldn’t simply be there for “shock value” or for its own sake unless it contributes to the story. A similar fate appears to have delayed Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories anthology, which the original showrunners had envisioned as an “edgy, high-concept” show, but Apple declared that vision as being too dark and replaced the original lead team with Once Upon a Time duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Despite a report earlier this week that said that the series would also be coming in November, it appears to have been delayed.

,,"Work Wives: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon Unpack ‘Morning Show’ Twists, Space Travel and Messy Romances"," Photographs by Dan Doperalski “We knew this season was different.” That’s how “The Morning Show” star and executive producer Reese Witherspoon begins Variety’s conversation about the third season of the Apple TV+ series. Co-star (and fellow executive producer) Jennifer Aniston adds, “It had a different shape to it.” In their first interview after the SAG-AFTRA strike — and the day of the Critics’ Choice nominations — Witherspoon and Aniston dissect Season 3’s wild twists and turns, which include a trip to space with Jon Hamm’s billionaire character Paul Marks, as well as a Jan. 6 insurrection storyline.  The two have known each other for more than 20 years, and as Aniston puts it: “We’re partners. We’re friends. We’re girlfriends, and we share all sorts of heartbreaks in life and love and everything.” To that end, when she begins crying while speaking about the death of her “Friends” co-star Matthew Perry, Witherspoon immediately grabs Aniston’s hand, and doesn’t let go for the rest of the conversation.  At the beginning of each season, do you know everything that’s to come for your characters? Specifically, Reese, did you know the insurrection plot that would be the linchpin of your character Bradley’s arc? Reese Witherspoon: I knew I had this secret that was going to get revealed by the end. When Charlotte Stoudt came in — this is her first season at “The Morning Show” — she pitched out the whole thing: the hack; Paul Marks coming in to take over; Alex [played by Aniston] wanting a position of power on the board; my character hiding this Jan. 6 secret.
Jennifer Aniston: It’s such a collaboration, and we are able to say if we felt like it wasn’t going in a great direction. That’s the fun of what we do together, having that open line of communication. How did you react when you heard that the premiere would include a trip to space? Aniston: Wow. Going into space, huh? Personally, I was like, “I would never do that! You’ve got to be out of your freaking mind!”
Witherspoon: I would never do that either! It appeared to fans that you were in far fewer scenes together this season. Reading your faces, is that not how it seemed to you? Witherspoon: We do have two different storylines, so if we did everything together it’d be like, we’d never sleep. It’d be like I work the day shift, and you work the night shift. I do hear that people’s favorite scenes are when we’re together.
Aniston: I know, it’s just hard to put it into each other’s storylines because they’re separate. Unless I was popping up in your and Julianna [Margulies]’s bed, like, “Hi, can I get you some coffee?”  You’ve worked together a long time. How would you describe your working and personal relationship? Aniston: We’ve been in each other’s lives for 20-something years. It’s just in our DNA that we are collaborators. We’re partners. We’re friends. We’re girlfriends, we share all sorts of heartbreaks in life and love and everything.
Witherspoon: There’s a comfort to that. It’s just mutual respect and years of experience. And I think we’re both incredulous that we’re both still kicking around! That we’re still working at this level is such a privilege. It’s an honor to get to contribute to something that’s really speaking about the world we live in nowadays.
Aniston: That’s what we wanted to do: Make a show that said something and to show the conversations that happen behind closed doors. Bradley’s life ended in shambles — Laura has broken up with her, she’s turned herself in to the FBI for concealing evidence that her brother was a Jan. 6 insurrectionist. Witherspoon: She’s made a mess of her life! Everyone keeps asking me, “Does she go to jail?” We don’t know anything! There were nearly two full years between Seasons 2 and 3. Will there be a big time jump in Season 4? Witherspoon: I think so, just because it takes us so long. They write for so long, and have brand new storylines that are happening. I think we’re a little behind in time, too.
Aniston: And our show tends to mirror what is actually happening in the world.
Witherspoon: Yeah, so as things come up while they’re writing, they’ll put them into the story. Is there a discussion of adding the Israel-Hamas war next season? Witherspoon: It has not come up. OK. Given that Bradley is likely going to prison, could she be on air again? Witherspoon: From prison?  Well, I was thinking after! Witherspoon: It’s far-fetched, but in this day and age, honestly, nothing surprises me anymore — except murder. Let’s talk about Alex and Paul. They had a passionate and, dare I say, sweet romance until she found out that he was a snake. Aniston: But was he? Or was that just his nature? I don’t think he felt that it was intentional. He just is who he is. But that was fun. I’ve known the Hammanator for a long, long time.
Witherspoon: How did y’all meet?
Aniston: Paul Rudd! 12 years ago?
Witherspoon: Paul Rudd is his agent. I’m not kidding! I did a movie with Paul Rudd in 1996, and that’s when I met Jon Hamm. Alex and Paul’s love scene was more explicit than we’re used to seeing on the show. How did you guys prepare for that with director Mimi Leder? Witherspoon: I didn’t think it was explicit.
Aniston: Having Mimi there, you’re protected. I never felt uncomfortable. Jon was such a gentleman, always — I mean every move, every cut, “You OK?” It was also very choreographed. That’s the beauty of Mimi and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don’t prepare. They asked us if we wanted an intimacy coordinator. I’m from the olden days, so I was like, “What does that mean?” They said, “Where someone asks you if you’re OK,” and I’m like, “Please, this is awkward enough!” We’re seasoned — we can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there.  Do you feel like Alex has a bad picker when it comes to men? This is the second time she’s chosen someone who’s publicly viewed as dangerous. Witherspoon: Who was the first?
Aniston: Mitch.
Witherspoon: Oh, you weren’t a couple.
Aniston: No, we weren’t a couple, but I loved him. Maybe we’ll find out why she has such a bad picker. It’s hard to be a really successful woman and make that part of your life — it’s sort of the last thing on your to-do list. You’re busy doing so many other things in the world, which is why I think I failed so terribly at marriage —
Witherspoon: In the show.
Aniston: In the show, oh yeah!
Witherspoon: Just wanted to be clear. I don’t like saying women have bad pickers. Because that sort of feels like a judgment. Maybe Alex is brave enough to break her own heart.
Aniston: Or maybe these are lessons she’s in need of. Because, everything I’ve gone through in my life, there’s not one thing I would do over, at all. It’s all our journey. Chip made quite a splash on air after being fired from “TMS.” Will Mark Duplass be back?  Aniston: We have no idea what could happen in our world.
Witherspoon: He could be in prison, too!
Aniston: He could produce you from the cell. With everything going on in the world, what topics would you guys like to dive into? Witherspoon: I think it would be great to do something with AI and the veracity of news when things can be so easily manufactured. It’s really a strange time for journalism, and it just continues to evolve.
Aniston: It’s unsettling to know that so much is manufactured and can be so easily manufactured and that so many people just believe it at face value. There was so much respect for journalism and now, it’s so divided — you listen to one news channel and it’s this story and another news channel and it’s this story. It’s heartbreaking, that division. I hope it’s just an ebb and flow, and that the goodness, the quality and the respect will hopefully come back. It’s a really scary time to be a journalist. Some people view the show as “camp.” What do you both think?  Witherspoon: Like “Dynasty” campy? I don’t have a good perspective about that. I think we’re the wrong people to ask! I love “Dynasty.” I love powerful women in great outfits having a verbal argument.
Aniston: Give me some good “Below Deck: Down Under.” That’s all I can digest sometimes! What do you want people to get out of “The Morning Show”? Witherspoon: It’s creating adult conversations about issues that we’re dealing with every day in real time in our workplace environments and in our personal lives, so it helps us process. It mirrors a lot of what’s going on in the world, and life is complicated.
Aniston: And there’s something about allowing people to sit and digest [weekly], because everything is so fast. People’s attention spans are just so limited. To have a moment to sit and digest and think about it and talk about it, maybe watch it again to try to understand it. Then to go back to when we used to communicate with one another and connect with one another, which is something that I feel that we have drastically lost with these phones and the amount of distractions. God bless the ’90s.
Witherspoon: She always says that.
Aniston: We just had so much fun!  The show began with UBA rebuilding post-Mitch scandal. With UBA and MBN merging in Season 4, could this be a set up for the show’s final season? Witherspoon: Or does it create an entirely new world of characters? A new eco-system? We’ve always thought this world is so rich that you can find new characters, stories and new TV personalities, people who have emerged in the zeitgeist. How did you stay creative during the strike? Witherspoon: I found a chocolatier, and had them teach me and some of my friends how to make chocolates.
Aniston: Actual chocolate bars?
Witherspoon: No, bonbons.
Aniston: Like Lucy and Ethel?
Witherspoon: Yes, it’s so fun. We’ve got to do it! It’s so easy, too.
Aniston: Can we please have a night where we do that? I made soap and tree ornaments. I went to Ojai, turned off the news, and with my three best friends since I was 15 and 20, just got creative.
Witherspoon: This is one of my favorite things about Jen — she has friends from high school on. It’s a testament to what a good friend you are.
Aniston: We kind of raised each other. We all came from little tumultuous, broken families. It was the ’70s, ’80s, it was sort of a different time. People weren’t going, “How are you feeling? How does it make you feel?” No one’s ever asked me, “How does something make you feel?” All my friends’ kids are in therapy! Everybody’s fabulous. Your two kids — look at them!
Witherspoon: I have three.
Aniston: Three! That’s what I meant.
Witherspoon: It’s hard to keep track. By the way, I forget sometimes. 
Aniston: You still look like a little tiny girl to me, like my little sister. Like I always said, baby with a baby.
Witherspoon: I was a baby with a baby when I was on the set of “Friends.” I was like, “I’m nursing! Want to see my baby?”  Speaking of “Friends,” Jennifer, you recently lost a member of the “Friends” family. How do you want the world to remember Matthew Perry? Aniston: As he said he’d love to be remembered. He was happy. He was healthy. He had quit smoking. He was getting in shape. He was happy — that’s all I know. I was literally texting with him that morning, funny Matty. He was not in pain. He wasn’t struggling. He was happy.
Witherspoon: It’s important people know that.
Aniston: It is. I want people to know he was really healthy, and getting healthy. He was on a pursuit. He worked so hard. He really was dealt a tough one. I miss him dearly. We all do. Boy, he made us laugh really hard. So many people — from those who knew him to journalists — penned tributes to him. It must have been so incredible to see the outpouring of love. Aniston: It’s so beautiful. I hope he can know that he was loved in a way he never thought he was.
Witherspoon: You all were so close. It’s incredible what was born of those friendships, and how you guys have always taken care of each other for years and years. It’s really beautiful and set standards for our business, as well, with the way you respected each other. I feel lucky that I got to be on that show and I walked in like Alice in Wonderland, watching the most popular cast do this whole thing. I remember going home and going, oh, they’re in another league. They’re on another planet on comedy levels that I’ve never seen my entire life, pivoting on a dime and working on each other’s energy and it was extraordinary.
Aniston: I also have to say I think Matthew Perry’s dialect, his way of speaking, created a whole different world. We went with his lead, in a way. It just added something to our joy.

,,The Morning Show (American TV series)," The Morning Show, also known as Morning Wars in Australia and Indonesia,[1][2] is an American drama television series starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell that premiered on Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019.[3][4] The series is inspired by Brian Stelter's 2013 book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.[2][5] The show examines the characters and culture behind a network broadcast morning news program. After allegations of sexual misconduct, the male co-anchor of the program is forced off the show. Aspects of the #MeToo movement are examined from multiple perspectives as more information comes out regarding said misconduct. Subsequent seasons focus on other political topics and current events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, racial inequality, the Capitol riot, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The second season premiered on September 17, 2021.[6] In January 2022, the series was renewed for a third season,[7] which premiered on September 13, 2023.[8] On September 13, 2023 when the third season started Apple announced they renewed the series for a fourth season.[9] Alex Levy co-anchors The Morning Show (TMS), a popular morning news program broadcast from Manhattan on the UBA network, which has excellent viewership ratings and is perceived to have changed the face of American television. In the first season, after her on-air partner of 15 years, Mitch Kessler, is fired amidst a sexual misconduct scandal, Alex fights to retain her job as a top news anchor while paired with a new partner, Bradley Jackson, a field reporter whose series of impulsive decisions increasingly threatens the network. In the second season, the network CEO attempts to convince Alex to return to TMS as the COVID-19 pandemic engulfs the United States and the show itself. Meanwhile, Bradley deals with an identity crisis. In the third season, the network struggles for viewers for its subscription service and contemplates a takeover by tech titan Paul Marks. On November 8, 2017, it was announced that Apple had given the production a series order consisting of two seasons of ten episodes apiece. The series was set to be executive produced by Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Jay Carson, and Michael Ellenberg. Carson was expected to act as a writer and showrunner for the series as well. Production companies involved with the series were slated to consist of Media Res, Echo Films, and Hello Sunshine.[3][13][14] On April 4, 2018, it was announced that Carson had departed the production over creative differences. He was replaced as executive producer and showrunner by Kerry Ehrin.[15] On July 11, 2018, it was reported that Mimi Leder would serve as a director and executive producer for the series.[16] On October 23, 2018, it was reported that Kristin Hahn and Lauren Levy Neustadter would serve as additional executive producers for the series.[17] On June 22, 2020, Aniston revealed in a Variety interview with Lisa Kudrow that the show's development began prior to the Me Too movement, but was ultimately reworked to include and partially focus on it.[18] The show cost $15 million per episode, with Aniston and Witherspoon each earning $2 million per episode, not including producing fees and ownership points.[19] On January 10, 2022, Apple renewed the series for a third season.[7] On May 1, 2023, Apple renewed the series for a fourth season.[9] Alongside the initial series announcement, it was confirmed that Aniston and Witherspoon had been cast in the series' lead roles.[3][13][14] In October 2018, it was announced that Steve Carell, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billy Crudup, Néstor Carbonell and Mark Duplass had been cast in series regular roles.[17][10][11] On November 7, 2018, it was reported that Bel Powley, Karen Pittman, and Desean Terry had joined the main cast of the series.[12] On October 9, 2020, Greta Lee and Ruairi O'Connor officially joined the second season as regular characters.[20] On November 13, 2020, Hasan Minhaj was also announced as a new cast member.[21] On December 3, 2020, Julianna Margulies announced she joined the second season of the series.[22] In August 2022, it was announced that Jon Hamm and Nicole Beharie had joined the main cast for the third season, with Tig Notaro joining in a recurring role.[23][24][25] Principal photography for the first season commenced on October 31, 2018, at the James Oviatt Building in Los Angeles.[26] Filming continued in Los Angeles until filming started in New York City on May 9, 2019.[27] Production on the first season also concluded that May, after seven months of filming.[28] Production on the second season began on February 24, 2020.[29] On March 12, 2020, Apple TV+ halted production on the series due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[30] The second season resumed filming on October 19, 2020.[31] Between February and March 2021, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston, Mark Duplass, and Hannah Leder were spotted in Los Angeles filming the second season.[32][33] On May 18, 2021, filming for season two concluded.[34] Production on the third season began on August 16, 2022,[35] and it was announced on February 11, 2023 that the season's filming had wrapped up.[36] After the Apple Special Event of March 25, 2019, Witherspoon announced on Instagram that the series would premiere in the fall of 2019.[4] It premiered on Apple TV+ on November 1, 2019.[3][4] In January 2021, Apple announced that the second season would premiere in 2021.[37] The second season premiered on September 17, 2021.[6] It was announced that the third season would premiere on September 13, 2023.[38] During the Apple Special Event, a teaser trailer was released with footage from the series as well as footage from other original series set to premiere on Apple TV+.[39] Furthermore, Aniston, Witherspoon, and Carell were at the event to promote the series.[40] On August 12, 2019, Apple released a first look trailer for the series.[41] It was also revealed that the series would be titled Morning Wars in Australia, in order to distinguish the series from the Australian morning talk show of the same name.[1] On Rotten Tomatoes it received an overall score of 64%,[48] and an overall score of 61 on Metacritic.[49] For first season of The Morning Show, the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 61% approval rating, based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Flashy, but somewhat frivolous, The Morning Show often feels more like a vanity project than the hard-hitting drama it aspires to be—but there is pleasure to be had in watching Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon give it their all.""[42] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 61 out of 100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[43] The second season of the series received a 67% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""The Morning Show's second season has a slew of stupendous performances—but too many characters attempting to address too many hot-button issues makes it hard to know what any of them are actually trying to say.""[44] At Metacritic, the website gave the second season a 60 out of 100, based on 25 reviews.[45] The third season of the series received a 72% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Leaning into its soapier elements while bolstering an already star-studded cast with some welcome additions, The Morning Show upgrades from a shaky prestige program into an addictive guilty pleasure.""[46] At Metacritic, the website gave the third season a 65 out of 100, based on 30 reviews.[47] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a positive review and wrote: ""The Morning Show doesn't have the cinematic gravitas of the Showtime series The Loudest Voice or the Aaron Sorkin poetry of HBO's The Newsroom. It's more along the lines of the solid but underachieving Sports Night TV series from the late 1990s.""[50] According to TV analytics provider TVision, The Morning Show has been viewed by panel members 5.03 times as much as the average Apple TV+ original series or shows TVision has measured since Apple TV+ launched in November 2019.[51] The series became the second-most watched Apple TV+ series after Ted Lasso.[51] In December 2023, Deadline reported after the third season was released, the show became Apple TV+’s most watched series.[52] ",en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Show_(American_TV_series),

,,Apple is making a new TV show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston,"FILED UNDER: Friends stars, reunited! In 2019, probably. Apple is already making a TV show with Steven Spielberg. Now it’s making another one with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The show doesn’t have a name or a proposed air date (though spring of 2019 is a decent bet). But it’s going to be about the morning TV show industry*, and Apple is going to make at least two seasons of it. Apple has been all-but-officially interested in the show since it hit the market this summer (so, reportedly, was Netflix). It’s the second show Apple has officially committed to since it hired Sony TV execs Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June; a month ago, Apple said it would reboot Spielberg’s “Amazing Stories” show from the 1980s. In addition to reuniting Witherspoon and Aniston (Recode resident “Friends” expert Johana Bhuiyan reminds me that Witherspoon guest-starred as Aniston’s sister on that show), the show is important because it illustrates Apple’s focus on landing Very Big Names as it prepares to dive deeply into the TV business. Apple already took a step into TV this year when it created “Planet of the Apps” and a spinoff of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” bit. Now its executives politely chalk up those efforts as experiments, and say they’re ready to get into TV for real. Hence the Sony guys. It’s still unclear why Apple thinks it should make its own TV shows and what its distribution plans will be for the ones it does make. But for now it seems to view them as family-friendly brand-burnishing products it can use to highlight its video capabilities. * If you remember that CNN’s Brian Stelter once wrote a book about the real-life stories behind the morning news, then you get a gold star. Stelter, meanwhile, gets something even better: The author of “Top of the Morning” will be a consultant on this project, which Aniston and Witherspoon are executive producing.

,,Jennifer Aniston," Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress. She rose to international fame for her role as Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends from 1994 to 2004, which earned her Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. Since her career progressed in the 1990s, Aniston has become one of the world's highest-paid actresses.[1] The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1988 film Mac and Me. Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. She has since starred in a string of successful comedy films such as Office Space (1999), Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), We're the Millers (2013), Dumplin' (2018), and Murder Mystery (2019). Aniston also starred in the acclaimed independent films The Good Girl (2002), Friends with Money (2006), and Cake (2014). She returned to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award. Aniston has been included in numerous magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. Her net worth is estimated as $300 million, and her box office gross is over $1.6 billion worldwide.[2] She is the recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and is the co-founder of the production company Echo Films, established in 2008. Aniston was born on February 11, 1969, in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles[3][4] to Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[3] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louis Grieco, was from Italy.[5] Her mother's other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek. Her father's ancestry is from the Greek island of Crete. Aniston has two half-brothers: John Melick, her older maternal half-brother; and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[3] Her godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father's best friends.[3][6] Her family moved to New York City when she was a child.[3] Despite her father's television career, she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[7] Her parents divorced when she was nine.[8] Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[8] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society,[9] and where Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[10] She performed in The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[11] Aniston first worked in off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker's Grave,[3] and supported herself with part-time jobs including work as a telemarketer, waitress and bike messenger.[3] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year, she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[12] and moved back to Los Angeles.[13] She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990 and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[14] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[15] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[16] Aniston also appeared in the two failed television comedy series The Edge and Muddling Through,[17] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head and Burke's Law.[18][19] Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. As the head of NBC entertainment, he encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her in Friends,[20][17] a sitcom set to debut on NBC's 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producer wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[21] but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable, and Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down in favor of Friends.[22] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004, when Aniston took a 15-year hiatus from television save for occasional guest roles. The program was a massive hit and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition. Her character was especially popular.[23][24] She received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), and won for Lead Actress.[25] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck during the final season of Friends.[26] Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer, was widely popular among audiences; they were frequently voted television's favorite couple in polls and magazines.[27] After a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One.[28] Her first starring film vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), where she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. It received mixed reviews and was only a moderate commercial success;[29] but Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[30] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[31] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[32] Aniston appeared in the dramedy Rock Star (2001) opposite Mark Wahlberg and Dominic West. She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[33] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough: After languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[34] Aniston's biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), where she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week.[35] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[36][37] it was the fifth-highest-grossing feature film of the year.[38] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newlywed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004) opposite Ben Stiller,[39] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[40] it eventually made $172 million worldwide.[41] In 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[42][43] Both films were moderate box office hits.[44][45] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[46] Her next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair's recently purchased home. It received mixed reviews but grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend and $204 million worldwide.[47] The A.V. Club's Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review, stating, ""It's like watching the 'we were on a break' episode of Friends stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of Seinfeld around the corner.""[48] CinemaBlend gave the film a positive review stating, ""In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.""[49] In 2006, Aniston directed the short film Room 10, set in a hospital emergency room and starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson, as part of Glamour's Reel Moments film series.[50] She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film that year.[51] In 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of Dirt—playing the rival of Courteney Cox's character[52]—and in an episode of 30 Rock, playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.[53] For the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[54] The 2008 comedy drama Marley & Me, starring Aniston and Owen Wilson as the owners of the titular dog, set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office sales ever with $14.75 million. It earned a total of $51.7 million over the four-day weekend and placed number one at the box office, a position it maintained for two weeks.[55] The total worldwide gross was $242.7 million.[56] Her next film in wide release, the romantic comedy He's Just Not That Into You (2009), in which she starred opposite Ben Affleck, grossed $178.8 million globally[57] and ranked number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend.[58] While it received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were praised by critics as standouts in the film.[59][60] Aniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that ""the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.""[61] Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide.[62] A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film's opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed ""a dispiriting $8.4 million"".[63] The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.[64] In 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC's sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist.[65] Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, ""[her role] is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.""[66][67][68] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[69][70][71] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses.[72] Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[73][74] Aniston appeared in the comedy Wanderlust (2012) with Paul Rudd,[75] with whom she acted in The Object of My Affection and also Friends, as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them.[76] The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures,[77] was produced by Judd Apatow.[78][79] Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.[80] Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in We're the Millers (2013). The film received mixed reviews from critics,[81] but was a financial success, grossing $269 million against a budget of $37 million.[82] Aniston played the role of a stoic socialite who becomes the target of an ill-planned kidnapping plot in Life of Crime (2014), a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1978 novel The Switch.[83] The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews.[84] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian described her performance as ""endearingly comic""[85] and Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote that ""Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on Friends.""[86] She also reprised her role for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014).[87] In Cake (2014), Aniston starred as an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain.[88] The film received mixed reviews; nonetheless, Aniston's performance was acclaimed, dubbed by some critics as ""Oscar-worthy"".[89][90][91][92] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance ""heartbreakingly good"",[93] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, ""It's really on most people's radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn't disappoint."" He further stated, ""Aniston makes you believe in Claire's pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It's a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.""[94] For her performance, Aniston was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.[95][96] She was also nominated multiple nominations for its latter seasons. In 2015, Aniston starred as a reluctant therapist in the screwball comedy She's Funny That Way,[97] which received mixed reviews and found a limited release in theaters, but her performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of Grantland called her ""one of the great screen comedians. ... Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. ... This isn't just Aniston having the best stuff. It's her having the most fun with her talent. She's funny in every way.""[98] Aniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother's Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall, and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[99] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[100] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[101] which was released to mostly positive reviews; it grossed over $183.4 million against a $70 million budget.[102][103] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[104] It grossed $114.5 million worldwide.[105] In The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrays the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[106] While she said she does not ""normally gravitate toward being in war films"", she made an exception because the film was ""written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced"".[107] The film, first presented at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[108] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: ""Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances"".[109] In December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin', with Aniston as executive producer and star—marking her first project for a streaming service.[110] That year, she began work on another Netflix project, Murder Mystery, a comedy that reunited her with Adam Sandler, which premiered on June 14, 2019.[111] The two of them reunited for the sequel Murder Mystery 2, which premiered on March 31, 2023.[112] Aniston made her return to television on November 1, 2019, producing and starring alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show. It was her first main television role since the conclusion of Friends in 2004.[113] For its first season, Aniston won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series,[114] and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Best Television Series – Drama as a producer.[115][116] The series' latter seasons earned her multiple additional nominations at Critics' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards.[117][118][119] She reunited with her Friends cast mates for an HBO Max unscripted television special titled Friends: The Reunion in May 2021.[120] The special earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) for her producing credit.[121] Aniston is one of the world's highest-paid actresses as of 2018.[122] She has been on the Forbes Top Earning Actresses list for 15 years, every year since 2001—and since then also on its Celebrity 100 list (based on ""earnings and fame""), topping it in 2003.[123][124] According to Forbes, in October 2007, Aniston was the best-selling celebrity face of the entertainment industry.[125] The magazine estimated her net worth at $110 million in 2007,[126] and $200 million in 2017.[127] It listed her earnings as $19.5 million in 2018.[128] Aniston has been included in various magazine lists of the world's most beautiful women.[129][130][131] In 2005, she became the first GQ Woman of the Year. She has frequently appeared on People magazine's annual list of Most Beautiful Women, topping the ranking in 2004 and 2016.[132] She also topped the magazine's Best Dressed List in 2006. She has been a regular on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list since 1996, most recently ranking at number 79 in 2012.[133] A survey of their patients by two Hollywood plastic surgeons, reported in 2011 by The Daily Telegraph, identified her (alongside Gisele Bündchen and Penélope Cruz) as having one of the most sought-after body shapes.[134] In the same year, readers of Men's Health voted her as the Sexiest Woman of All Time.[135] Men's Health also included her on its 100 Hottest Sex Symbols of All Time list, explaining that ""Her down-to-earth persona makes her seem attainable, and anyone who's seen her in Office Space has to admit she makes even pieces of flair look good. She rarely plays the airhead, and she seldom overplays a role: she's funny in a quiet, refreshingly human way. And her all-too-human love life off screen inspires sympathy that not even a string of bland romantic comedies can diminish. Other sex symbols drift toward one-dimensionality, becoming flat icons in the process, but throughout her career Aniston has remained sexy, funny, and unmistakably real.""[136] Although Aniston disliked the hairstyle she wore during her first two years on Friends, ""The Rachel"" became very popular.[137][138] She received a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 22, 2012,[139] located at 6270 Hollywood Boulevard.[140] She was ranked third on Forbes' list of the 100 Most Powerful Actresses in Hollywood in 2013.[141] In July 2016, amidst media speculation over whether she was pregnant, Aniston penned an essay for The Huffington Post condemning the ""objectification and scrutiny we put women through"". She asserted: ""We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. [...] We don't need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own 'happily ever after' for ourselves.""[142] The piece was supported by many celebrities and widely covered in the media.[143] After years of aversion to social media, Aniston joined Instagram on October 15, 2019, causing the app to ""break"" (for hours the ""follow"" button became inoperable due to an overload of web traffic to her account) with the first picture of the planned Friends cast reunion for HBO Max (whose release was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Within five hours and sixteen minutes, she broke the Guinness World Record for fastest time to reach one million followers on the platform.[144] The record was broken in September 2020, by Sir David Attenborough, who achieved the same feat in 44 minutes.[145] Aniston practices Hatha yoga and Budokan karate.[146][147][148] In 2014, she spoke of her Transcendental Meditation practice.[149] The following year, she revealed she has dyslexia, which had affected her education and self-esteem, and that after being diagnosed in her twenties, her outlook toward life changed. She stated, ""I thought I wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain anything. Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained.""[150] Aniston donated to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and took part in a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign.[151][152][153] She endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[154] Aniston does not have any children. In July 2016, she wrote an op-ed piece for the HuffPost titled ""For the Record"", where she criticized the media for the focus on her body and speculation over potential pregnancies.[155] She wrote, ""The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing."" In November 2022, she appeared on the cover of Allure for their final print issue.[156] In the accompanying interview, Aniston said she had undergone IVF to try and have children when she was in her thirties and forties, but the attempts did not result in any pregnancies.[157] She said, ""All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.""[156] In 2023, she disclosed that Adam Sandler's family sends her flowers every year on Mother's Day.[158] Aniston met Brad Pitt in 1998, and their relationship was highly publicized.[159][160] She married Pitt, after two years of dating, on July 29, 2000, in a lavish Malibu wedding. For a few years, their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success.[3] On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation,[161] and finalized their divorce on October 2.[162] During their divorce proceedings, news media speculated that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, with whom he began a relationship soon after the split.[163] In the months following, the public's reaction towards the divorce was reported in the press, and ""Team Aniston"" and ""Team Jolie"" T-shirts appeared throughout the country.[163] Aniston commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating, ""Nobody did anything wrong... It was just like, sometimes things [happen].""[150] In 2005, amid reports that their divorce was due to Aniston's refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston said, ""I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children. I did and I do and I will! ... I would never give up that experience for a career."" Aniston said the divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, Nancy, from whom she had been estranged for nearly a decade. Nancy had talked about her daughter on a television show and written From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999).[164][165] Aniston said she had been devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whom she credited for helping make her separation from Pitt easier.[51] She said she did not regret her relationship with Pitt, describing it as ""very intense"" and ""a beautiful, complicated relationship"".[166] Aniston began a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011. The following January, they purchased a home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles for roughly $22 million.[167] They became engaged on August 10, 2012[168] and were married on August 5, 2015, at their estate.[169] They separated at the end of 2017.[170] Aniston has appeared in commercials and music videos throughout her career. After starting on Friends, Aniston and her co-star Matthew Perry shot a 60-minute instructional video for the release of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system.[171] The next year she appeared in commercials for L'Oréal hair products.[172] Under a contract with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.,[173] Aniston worked for over a year on her first perfume, which was released in July 2010.[174][175] Original plans called for the perfume to be named ""Lolavie by Jennifer Aniston"", but to avoid confusion with a similarly named perfume, the name was changed to simply ""Jennifer Aniston"".[176] In 2014, she launched her second perfume, named J,[177][178] followed by Near Dusk (2015),[173] Beachscape (2016),[179] Luxe & Chapter One (both in 2017), Chapter Two (2018), Silver & Solstice Bloom (both in 2020).[180][181] In 2021, Aniston launched the LolaVie haircare company.[182] Since 2007, she has worked in a publicity campaign for the drink SmartWater; on March 7, 2011, she released a YouTube video for SmartWater, Jennifer Aniston Goes Viral, which tripled online interest in the product within 24 hours of its release.[183] In 2012, Aniston co-founded hair care brand Living Proof and also became its spokeswoman. She left when the company was sold to Unilever in 2016.[184] In January 2013, she became the new spokeswoman of Aveeno Skincare.[185] She replaced Daniella van Graas as Aveeno's spokesmodel and became its new ""face"". Reportedly, Aniston is paid ""eight figures"" for her endorsement.[186] She became the new face of Emirates airline in 2015,[187] which was reportedly a success.[188] For pharmaceutical company Shire, she appeared in a 2016 campaign raising awareness about chronic dry eye.[189][190] She appeared in the 1996 Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers music video for ""Walls"", and in 2001, in Melissa Etheridge's music video for ""I Want to Be in Love"".[191][unreliable source?] She also appeared in a Heineken commercial.[172] Along with Brad Pitt and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures, Aniston founded the film production company Plan B Entertainment in 2002,[192] although she and Grey withdrew in 2005.[193][194] In 2008, she and producer Kristin Hahn formed Echo Films.[195] Aniston has been a celebrity advocate for numerous charities and received attention for her own donations. She has appeared in television commercials for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, and hosted September 2008's Stand Up to Cancer show.[196] In the ""It Can't Wait"" campaign to free Burma, Aniston directed and starred in a video.[197] She is a supporter of Friends of El Faro, a nonprofit organization that helps raise money for Casa Hogar Sion, an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico.[198] On April 14, 2007, Aniston received GLAAD's Vanguard Award for her contributions to increased visibility and understanding of the LGBT community.[199] In 2013, she was named the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) ambassador for the Saks Fifth Avenue Key to the Cure campaign, which raises funds for the EIF Women's Cancer Research Fund.[200] In 2015, she supported the Comic Relief, Inc. charity.[201] Other charities that Aniston has publicly supported include Clothes Off Our Back, Feeding America, EB Medical Research Foundation, Project A.L.S., OmniPeace, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.[202] Aniston donated $500,000 to Doctors Without Borders, Haitian health care provider Partners in Health and AmeriCares,[203][204] and also participated in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon. She donated $500,000 to the Red Cross and another $500,000 to the Ricky Martin Foundation in 2017 to help victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.[205] After being honored by SmartWater in 2016 for her ongoing philanthropic work for St. Jude's, Aniston spoke of the importance of philanthropy in her life to InStyle magazine: ""We live an extremely beautiful, fortunate life being able to do what we get to do for a living. And so it's a way of being able to be in a position to do something for people who are less able. It's something that makes my heart smile.""[206] Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Golden Globe Award nominations, and nine SAG Award nominations for her role in Friends. From these, she won one of each. She also garnered a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her guest appearance in 30 Rock, while her performance in Cake earned her nominations at the Golden Globe and SAG awards. Aniston additionally won a SAG Award and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the first season of The Morning Show, and earned multiple nominations at Critics' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards for its latter seasons.

,,Here's What Jennifer Aniston Eats in a Day to Feel Strong and Vibrant,"Plus, discover the 50-something-year-old actress's favorite dinner party menu when she's in charge of hosting.   Whether you know her from her time as Rachel Green on the TV show Friends, the love interest in movies like Rumor Has It, The Object of My Affection and Marley & Me, or, more recently, as Alex Levy on Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, chances are, you know Jennifer Aniston. But did you know that the actress and hair care entrepreneur is in her 50s? Looking at least a decade younger, it's no wonder Aniston is a spokesperson for wellness-minded brands like Vital Proteins and Aveeno. We'll have what she's having—well, unless it's the same salad every.single.day. ICYMI, Aniston was known to bring the same salad each and every day of filming Friends to share with co-stars and pals-in-real-life Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow (we have the recipe here!). But the fact that Aniston is such a creature of habit in some areas of her life has served her well. Case in point—her dedication to yoga, which she has practiced for more than a decade, and her daily 10- to 20-minute meditation habit. When she was selected as PEOPLE magazine's ""World's Most beautiful woman"" of 2016, she admitted that she started to follow the lead of her yoga practice, allowing for much more flexibility beyond that staple salad. ""I'm not as strict as I was. It was always sort of a monitored watch. Then I thought, 'Just give yourself moderation.'"" To Aniston, beauty is ""learning to love every single thing about yourself. And also realizing that it's not just clothes and what's happening [on the outside]. There's so much more that's beautiful in a human being."" That said, she is still cognizant of what she consumes. ""We've got to really be conscious and mindful around what we put inside our bodies. And how we sleep and how we eat and how we take care of ourselves,"" Aniston adds to PEOPLE. Read on to discover the foods and drinks Aniston mindfully chooses to help her feel her best. Spoiler alert: It's much more than the same ol' salad. Every day starts with a glass of hot water with lemon, then usually a cup of coffee with a splash of milk and stevia, she tells PEOPLE. Alongside, she'll fuel up with avocado and eggs with a little coconut oil, oatmeal with egg whites whipped in for some extra protein and a ""fluffy texture that's delicious,"" Aniston tells Elle—or a sippable meal like this Chocolate Protein Shake. The lineup for the blender beverage might change a bit throughout the week, but generally includes ""some sort of pure protein, then bananas, blueberries, frozen cherries, stevia, a vegetable mix of dynamic greens that goes in there, maca powder and a little cacao,"" Aniston tells Well + Good. ""There's a collagen peptide that I've been loving—I've been seeing a difference! My nails are stronger, and there's a healthier...glow. It's sort of that working from the inside-out thing."" It's worth mentioning that Aniston has a partnership with Vital Proteins, which is also one of our dietitian's favorite collagen powders. Lunch is ""some form of vegetables or salad with protein—pretty basic,"" she tells Elle. But just because it's basic doesn't mean Aniston leaves it up to chance. She plans ahead to make it possible to toss something nutritious together even during the busiest of days. ""I always have cut raw vegetables in a Tupperware container. Hard-boiled eggs are always great to have in the fridge, as well as a big head of butter lettuce. I also include protein, such as pulled chicken,"" she tells Yahoo Food. When it comes time to transform that into a meal, it might be that chicken or seared ahi tuna with a salad, or a chicken burger tucked inside a lettuce wrap, she reveals to Harper's Bazaar. One thing you'll never find in her fridge? Beets. ""I'm not a fan. And you won't find caviar. Nope, you can't acquire that taste no matter how many people say that,"" adds Aniston. To stay energized between meals, Aniston drinks plenty of water and snacks on a healthy carb source and/or something that packs a protein punch. An apple with almond butter, a cheese stick, a handful of nuts or a cup of soup are on frequent rotation. Dinner is where Aniston really lets her creativity shine. Typically, her evening meal also includes a vegetable and a protein, although she goes on kicks when she's in the mood for Mexican food—margaritas included, just ""clean, no sugar,"" she tells InStyle. She enjoys having pals over for a DIY pizza night potluck with wine pairings, too. ""Everyone can participate and make their own pizzas. I have one friend that brings sweets and dessert; other people bring wine. One year, a friend brought all of the pizza dough that we used for the party, so that was fun,"" she tells Yahoo Food. Pasta is also a favorite, be it a low-carb swap like zoodles with pesto and roasted chicken or the real-deal noodles in a carbonara-style sauce. Her lightened-up version of carbonara features turkey bacon instead of pork, eggs and Parmesan. ""No oil, butter or creams. And we use pasta water to make it juicier,"" she explains to Yahoo Food (Giada De Laurentiis would be so proud!). Rather than turning to the more restrictive diets that she dabbled in through the years—including the Grapefruit Diet and Nutrisystem—any time Aniston feels like she's veering off track from a meal plan that makes her feel like her best and most vibrant self, she does a minor course correction. ""If anything, my exercise usually increases a little bit, and I keep the sodium super low. But again, because my diet's good all year round, I don't do a big reset,"" explains Aniston to Yahoo Food. ""I don't let eating habits get out of control where I need a reset button. My general philosophy is to eat healthy. It's pretty clear: Eat as much organic fruits and veggies as you can, keep sugar [intake] low, drink tons and tons of water and get good sleep. I allow myself to indulge once in a while...I don't give myself any rules anymore."" If you ask us, having zero rules looks great on Jen, and her well-balanced, vegetable-strong, protein-rich menu seems like just one element of her healthy lifestyle that can definitely last a lifetime—a beautiful, delicious, long lifetime. ""I think our bodies are beautiful, and I think celebrating them and being comfortable in them—no matter what age you are—is important,"" Aniston told Harper's Bazaar in 2019.

NBC’s Thursday night “Must See TV” lineup (which included, at various times, Seinfeld, ER, and 3rd Rock from the Sun) had pushed the network back to primetime-TV dominance, and Friends was the jewel in that crown. The show launched in 1994, explicitly to reach the rising market of Gen X–ers starting out on adult life in the big cities. And how better to find that audience than by putting it on-screen?

,,,"        Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon fans, rejoice. The duo will be back on our television screens on September 13 when SAG and Critics Choice Award-winning drama Morning Wars returns to Apple TV+ for season three. And the trailer has finally arrived. This season, the future of the network is thrown into question again, as a tech titan takes an interest in broadcast company UBA. A first-look reveals Mad Men’s Jon Hamm and Sleepy Hollow’s Nicole Beharie will join ensemble cast Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, and Julianna Margulies. “Loyalties are pushed to the brink,” reads the statement from Apple TV+. “Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponised, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom.” Long known as a rom-com darling (Think: She’s The One, The Object Of My Affection, Picture Perfect and Along Came Polly) Aniston took home the Best Actress In A Drama Series gong at the 2020 SAG Awards for her role as Alex Levy, the clever and sharp-shooting anchor-woman, in Morning Wars. “Boy, did we get to dive deep into our own experiences [to] breathe life into these extraordinary characters,” Aniston said upon accepting her award. “Who knew emotional breakdowns felt that good? It was literally like seven months of therapy covering 20 years of work. So, thank you for watching that!” A standout scene includes the below where Alex lays down the law before a phalanx of blue suits. “America loves me. And therefore I own America,” says Alex in a revolutionary red coat. “You guys are so convinced that you are the rightful owner of all of the power that it doesn’t occur to you that someone else could be in the driver’s seat.  Morning Wars (which is titled The Morning Show in the United States) has also been renewed for season four. Aniston, 54, and Witherspoon, 47, first met on the set of Friends when Witherspoon, then 23, was playing Aniston’s character’s younger sister. “I was 23 years old and had just had a baby,” Witherspoon told People. “I was nursing [daughter] Ava on set, and Jen just kept going, ‘You have a baby?’ I was like, ‘I know, it’s weird.’ … I remember her being like, ‘Where are you going?’ And I was like, ‘I’m pumping!’” MORNING WARS, SEASON 3, WILL STREAM ON SEPTEMBER 13 ON APPLE TV+.

,,Jennifer Aniston,,www.instyle.com,https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/jennifer-aniston,
,, ,"by habituallychic Rene Russo’s wardrobe in The Thomas Crown Affair used to be my favorite movie wardrobe inspiration but that was before I fell in love with everything that Jennifer Aniston wears in each episode of The Morning Show. It actually reminds me of what I used to wear in the corporate world when I moved to New York 18 years ago, except my clothes were from J.Crew and Banana Republic. Jennifer Aniston’s character Alex Levy is dressed in cashmere suits and sweaters from Max Mara and other luxury brands. It’s nicer than anything any of the real network morning show anchors wear on their shows and is a great example of how to exude professionalism in the workplace even if everything is falling apart. Jennifer actually had a hand in choosing her clothes which are tailored and monochromatic with an occasional pop of color. It wasn’t very clear from Apple TV on how many episodes this season of The Morning Show would air. I thought it was just the three online so far but it turns out that a new episode will every Friday from now until December 20, 2019. They’ve already started working on season two and I can’t wait to see what’s to come from this intelligent and compelling new series. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen Jennifer Aniston act so beautifully before. She said it was the hardest thing she’s ever done and you can tell from the emotion she exudes on screen. It’s no wonder her character who is going through so much and has to awake five days a week at 3:30am would want to wrap themself up in cashmere on the way to work. I love the fashions just as much as the show and have put together some inspiring outfits from Jennifer Aniston’s wardrobe that are perfect for work and weekends. Everything she wears makes me want to throw all the pattern out of my closest and stop buying crap from Zara. It might make you want to do the same. When we first see Jennifer Aniston’s character, she’s waking up at 3:30am and getting ready for work. It’s funny how her beauty routing reminds me of the beginning of Mommie Dearest when Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford does the same. Because it’s April in New York and she doesn’t actually get dressed for the show until she arrives at the studio, she wears comfy clothes and sneakers while packing all her work essentials into a chic bag. I’m pretty sure that the camel coat that she wears is the Theory Cashmere Coat that is mostly sold out. Keep in mind that movies and television shows shoot a year before they air so I’ve tried to find the closest match when the exact item isn’t available. I love this Weekend Max Mara coat for its similar style but it’s double faced wool. If you need something warmer try the madame coat, single breasted midi coat or  oversized wool and cashmere-blend coat. The wife of Steve Carell’s character wears a camel Weekend Max Mara double faced wool jacket when we briefly see her. Because it’s still chilly in New York, Jennifer’s character wears lots of cozy sweaters like this S Max Mara wool and cashmere sweater. I also like this wool cashmere chunky sweater. You also can’t go wrong with any sweater from Everlane. These black high-rise wide-leg stretch-jersey trousers look comfy for an early morning ride to work. I think it’s so refreshing that she wears white leather sneakers with multiple outfits. Alex Levy, Jennifer’s character, carries Valextra bags exclusively. She carried the Valextra Brera large leather top handle bag with this outfit. When we see Alex Levy for her first broadcast after the shocking news breaks, she is trying to pull it together emotionally and having her outfit look pulled together probably helps. The actual blazer she wears is the Dior Bar jacket in wool and silk with a $4,100 price tag that doesn’t even include the pants. Other similar options I like are below. Another expensive option with the same shape is this Loro Piana cashmere blazer but I also like the Pallas single-breasted wool-twill blazer and Raey oversized single-breasted wool Harris-tweed blazer. Alex always wears trousers since the desk is clear and there can’t be any wardrobe malfunctions on morning television. These Max Mara Studio navy trousers are classic but the silver trim makes them a little more interesting. Theory is also a great place to find trousers for work. While she wear sneakers to work, Alex always wears heels like these navy suede pumps on air. Her on air outfits don’t require a handbag but I imagined that if she had to go to a lunch meeting after the show, she’d carry this Valextra Medium Colorblock Calf Leather Top Handle Bag. This is my favorite look that Alex Levy wears to work on the second morning we see her. I love whoever styles the outfits and they way they tied the sweater around her neck like a scarf. We don’t actually see the bottom of her outfit so I took the liberty of picking out other pieces she might wear. April is probably one of the best months in New York for double faced wool coats like this Theory double faced coat and for those of you who live in milder climates like California and the south. It’s weirdly hard to find a nice brown sweater. You could splurge on this oversized cashmere sweater from The Row, this Max Mara Wool Cashmere Sweater, or something in a different shade from Everlane or J.Crew. Alex Levy is not going to wear a white tee shirt from Hanes. She’s going to wear a white tee shirt like this organic cotton jersey top or this one. You can only see a little bit of the top of her pants in the scene where she wear this outfit so I imagined that she might wear these Cashmere Relaxed Lounge Pants on her way to work. She’d probably just wear her white sneakers but I’d also like to think she might wear these cashmere, suede and leather sneakers. A less expensive option are these New Balance sneakers. This Khaite envelope pleat medium leather tote definitely looks like a bag Alex Levy would carry. Someone said there were glad to see the character wearing glasses to read as any person over the age of 40 might have to do. These Gucci round-frame tortoiseshell acetate optical glasses are a chic pair but you can never go wrong at Warby Parker. I won’t give it away but this is what Alex wears for an outing in the rain. When she takes her coat off, you can clearly see the plaid lining of her classic Burberry trench coat. Every woman should have one in their closet. Alex wears a black cashmere hoodie and matching pants under the trench. I’m sure hers are Max Mara but you can find similar from many other places. I like these cashmere sweatpants but it looks like the matching cashmere sweatshirt just sold out. You could pair it with the cashmere crewneck sweater or try Naked Cashmere Colette Sweater and matching Katherine Jogger Pants. I also really like this Skin wool-blend hooded sweater and matching wool-blend trousers. They’d be great for traveling. She’d probably wear impractical shoes like these suede and leather collapsible-heel sneakers. These are two more on air outfits that are great workwear inspiration. It also looks like everything in her on air closet can be mixed and matched to make more options since it’s almost all shades of gray, navy, and black. As you know I love a bow tie blouse. This Max Mara blouse has a subtle patten which gives it a little interest. This navy Max Mara Studio bow tie blouse matches the Max Mara Studio navy trousers above. These stretch-wool flared pants look like the perfect work trouser to wear with heels. Alex wears this exact Theory featherweight grey sweater on the show but it’s mostly sold out because it’s from a previous season. You could also try this cashmere v-neck sweater and this cashmere v-neck sweater. This Joseph cashmere sweater is a similar weight to the original. These Italian stretch wool trousers are another great work pant. I bought these last year and had my tailor add belt loops. Every woman should also have a black suede pump in their closet in the heel height that works best for them. It’s funny that Alex Levy doesn’t even wear a dress to a formal affair. Instead she wears pants in the form of a jumpsuit to the event at which she’s being honored. I wonder if it’s because she’s in such a male dominated industry. Regardless, it’s an amazing outfit. The red strapless silk crepe jumpsuit is from Valentino and not available in many sizes since the show aired. I also love this Victoria Beckham mesh-paneled cady gown in the same shade of red. This is the exact Michael Kors Collection Double-Face Cashmere Melton Trench Robe Coat that she wears over her Valentino jumpsuit. The good news is that it’s on sale. The bad news is that most sizes are gone. This Max Mara Vincent Long Button-Front Double-Face Wool Coat is very similar and available in all sizes. I also like this red double-breasted wool-blend coat to wear with grey outfits and this red Long Wool Blend Trench Coat is a great price. You can’t see what shoes she’s wearing but these red suede sandals look like a perfect match. Update: One of the stylists for the show just posted a behind the scenes photo of this outfit and shows she’s these red Gianvito Rossi suede pumps. She carries this exact Jimmy Choo J Box Clutch which is also a perfect match to the jumpsuit. When she’s in the car, she’s moving things from this Valextra bag to the clutch. She wears $13,000 Elie Top drop earrings with the dress but I love these gold-plated pearl earrings as much more reasonably priced option. She wears this big round watch with a red band like this IWC SCHAFFHAUSEN Portofino watch with her red dress. She actually wears big round watches through out the show so they must have made a product placement deal. Update: I found out that the watches Alex Levy wears are all from Chopard. She wears the Chopard L.U.C XPS 40MM automatic watch in rose gold with a custom red brushed fabric strap by Chopard “to both suit the evening occasion and better match Alex’s Valentino jumpsuit.”  The all grey outfit is the one that I already have in my closet. I love grey in the winter because it’s so much less harsh than all black. Jen and I have the same color hair so it’s a good color for us too. This grey Weekend Max Mara wool coat is a great soft option because there is nothing worse than an itchy wool coat. I like this luxurious grey cashmere sweater but the Everlane cashmere sweater is only $100 if you’re looking for a deal. I think it’s important to add some texture and interest to your outfit if you are wearing all grey like these wide-leg pleated pant in wool tweed. I like the subtle ombre of this grey cashmere scarf. This grey cashmere scarf is smaller but also much cheaper. With the grey ensemble, she of course carries a grey Valextra Brera Large Leather Top-Handle Tote Bag. She also carries the Valextra Soft Leather Tote Bag in the burnt orange outfit she wears in the photo down below. I tried to figure out what shoes she is wearing with the grey outfit but I couldn’t figure it out. They look like a navy loafer or oxford but these navy suede and leather sneakers would also work. This IWC SCHAFFHAUSEN Pilot’s Automatic stainless steel and alligator watch would be the perfect complement to the grey outfit and navy shoes. Sleepwear so far has played a big part of the first three episodes of The Morning Show. Jennifer Aniston’s character opens the first episode in striped pajamas similar to these striped cotton-voile pajama set and this striped silk-charmeuse pyjama shirt and matching striped silk-charmeuse pyjama trousers. She wakes up to a view of the city which no morning anchor would ever do. She would have had electric black out shade or worn an eye mask like this navy silk eye mask. She also uses eye patches and a jade face roller in the morning to deff puff and worries if she really has “passed her sell by date” for television. In another episode she wears a matching lounge set of a robe and jogger pants. I can’t find her exact set but this Naked Cashmere robe is very similar. The two middle photos are from the first three episodes and the other four are from episodes to come. As I stated, I’m really enjoying The Morning Show and can’t to watch the next seven episodes. I also can’t wait to see what Jennifer Anison’s character wears. I tried reaching out to the costume designers, Sophie De Rakoff, and Nina and Clare Hallworth, to ask them some questions but I never heard back from any of them. I’d love to chat with them about their wardrobe choices if anyone knows them. Also, I’m not sure how many people know this but a free year of Apple TV is included when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac after September 10, 2019, from Apple or an Apple-authorized reseller. Your new device must also be capable of running the latest iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or macOS. If you don’t qualify for a free year, Apple TV is $4.99 a month but the first two episodes of The Morning Show are free for anyone to watch online.

,,How did The Morning Show become the messiest show on TV?,"In its second season, the star-studded Apple TV drama is a chaotic, uneven and ham-fisted yet compulsively watchable rumination on workplace ethics amid the pandemic W
atching The Morning Show, Apple TV+’s messy, star-studded morning news drama whose second season premiered this fall, is for me a very vocal experience – the road from concept to execution so bumpy and the choices so chaotic as to provoke several guffaws an episode. The biggest “NO” comes in the beginning of the second season’s third episode: Daniel Henderson, co-anchor of the fictional Morning Show on the fictional UBA network, is quarantining in Beijing after exposure to a novel coronavirus in January 2020. On-air, he explains the concept of “social distancing” to the fake-cheery anchor Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon, now sans bad first-season brown wig), who cracks: “What? I feel like my family’s been ‘social distancing’ for a long time.” I rolled my eyes so hard my head hurt. The Morning Show has, since its release in September 2019, been an intriguing misfire, bolstered and blunted by its interest in recent events. In the first season, its handling of the cascading #MeToo movement at what seemed to be a lightly fictionalized NBC was bumbling, opaque, and perhaps unforgivable – in the season finale, the suicide of the producer Hannah (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), struggling years after she was pressured into sex by the star anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), was at best mishandled, at worst exploited for shock. But watching a show even attempt to wrestle with the bramble of workplace ethics and cultures of complicity was baseline compelling. As in real life, none of the characters handled those conversations well, but at least they were trying. The second season’s adherence to a hyper-documented, traumatic, still-unbelievable pandemic timeline is especially fraught. Do we need to relive the introduction of “social distancing” to the lexicon? Yet I am once again unable to stop watching, the unease of a show flying so close to our recent reality and the buzz of high-budget soap antics a heady, jarring mix. As Alison Herman put it in the Ringer: “There’s a thin line between bad and good-bad, but once a show crosses it, there’s nothing to do but go all in.” Midway through its second season, The Morning Show is not the prestige tentpole drama it aimed to be, but it may be the most compelling mess on TV. It’s hard to remember now, but its premiere in the fall of 2019 was awash in hype: a high-wattage show about a TV show, a loosely inspired adaptation of a book about morning show drama to the #MeToo era, Apple TV+’s marquee offering with a full prestige budget. The reception from critics was tepid, though there were several reasons to watch: it was Jennifer Aniston’s most compelling performance in years; Billy Crudup was irresistible as an amoral, kinetic media executive whose relish of drama (“chaos is the new cocaine!”) bordered on camp. Like Succession, HBO’s far nimbler, serrated portrait of callous media executives, The Morning Show offered fictionalized access to the boardrooms and levers of power most Americans will never see. The execution, however, was laughably uneven. Aniston, as a veteran morning show anchor calcified by the compromises required for success in a toxic atmosphere; Crudup; and a scene-chewing Witherspoon, playing a plucky upstart seemingly written for a 25-year-old, seemed to be acting in completely different productions. Aspirations of poignancy were mired by baffling left-field plot choices, out-of-character decisions, and a confusing, needless focus on Mitch Kessler’s emotional journey. It’s not that The Morning Show has gotten better, or even hit its stride, in season two – It’s just gotten bigger and soapier, with big-name additions (Holland Taylor as the UBA board chairman, Julianna Margulies as an ex-daytime anchor and Bradley’s love interest), as Ted Lasso has lifted the burden of anchoring Apple TV+’s success. It has continued to approach delicate concerns – coverups, payouts, NDAs, the privilege of corporate success over safety, racial tokenism in the workplace – with the subtlety of a hammer. That includes its signposting of the pandemic calamity. The first half of the second season takes place in early 2020. The timeline of The Morning Show is basically the same as ours, down to the early explainers of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan and the schedule of presidential debates its anchors are scrambling to moderate. Loyalty to a deeply documented and hyper-specific recent timeline, for a show about a program that narrativizes the news, is a little awkward, in part because it stars Jennifer Aniston, recognizable to almost anyone in 2020. Mostly, it’s just unsettling. The thin veneer of fiction on early 2020 – concerns over not covering the virus enough in January, Mitch Kessler’s ill-conceived redemption arc stuck in quarantine in Italy, mentions of Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete in the primary – is discomfiting, like drinking a flat soda, or reading a forgotten email from 2019. Yet there’s something appealing in the turbulence, or at least familiar in the mess. Though there’s an inherent cringe in side-swiping such an exhausting collective rupture, it’s at least entertaining to see it not be shoehorned into something coherent or purposeful. The Morning Show is ridiculous, probably more so than it intended, but so is the reality it scrambles to depict.

,,Watch: Jennifer Aniston fights back in dramatic first trailer for The Morning Show season three,"Incoming! Things are getting hot, hot, hot at UBA as The Morning Show returns for season three and everyone's favourite anchor team promises to 'burn it all down.' When we last met up with Jennifer Aniston and co the station was in turmoil and judging by the first look trailer for the new season things are every bit as backstabbing and political this time around. TODAY'S TOP VIDEOS Everything is to play for and the teaser shows Alex (Aniston) demanding to have her voice heard amid a ruthless takeover bid. The teaser clip sees her challenge network executive Corey, over her next step saying: 'I'm all over this network. I need to have a say in the future of this place.' In reply he tells her what she is asking is 'unprecedented' adding: 'You want that seat at the grownup table but it's not your turn, Alex' but she won't be mollified. Driving the shake-up at UBA is the arrival of tech giant in the form of Paul Marks (Jon Hamm) who takes a vested interest in the station that just might be the lifeline that could reverse its fortunes but at what cost? An embattled Corey proclaims in the clip: 'We are flirting with financial disaster. We need someone with more money than God!' It cuts to Paul saying: 'I'm offering you a lifeline. Take the money.' Compounding the drama, UBA becomes the target of a 'nuclear' hack that knocks them off air and seemingly spells disaster for Bradley (Reese Witherspoon). 'Certain things may come to light. Personal things that were never meant to shared,' she confesses. Alex is prepared for all of UBA's secrets to surface saying 'let all the secrets come out. They did not protect me.' Her lack of loyalty prompts Bradley to fire back 'They didn't protect you... but I did.' As Paul becomes friendly with Alex, she questions just how well she knows him which gets Alex's heckles up and she hits back saying 'what does that mean? Do you know how much is at stake here?' The trailer later sees Paul tell Alex his offer is 'a chance to create something better, but you have to really, really want it.' It then jumps to Corey saying: 'It's refreshing to get stabbed in the stomach instead of the back.' The Morning Show returns to AppleTV+ on 13 September.  Use precise geolocation data.

,,"‘The Morning Show’: 8 Wildest Moments, From Jon Hamm to Jan. 6","BY ABBY MONTEIL THESE DAYS, IT’S easy to forget how major The Morning Show was supposed to be. Launched the same day as its streaming home, Apple TV+, the series was poised to draw in casual viewers and awards voters alike with its star-studded cast and promises to tackle capital I-issues of the day in a pulpy, propulsively watchable fashion. Although The Morning Show was initially conceived as a loose adaptation of then-CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter’s 2013 book Top of the Morning — which dove into the morning show rivalry between NBC’s Today and ABC’s Good Morning America — it was retooled after sexual-misconduct allegations against ex-Today host Matt Lauer came to light in 2017 amid the #MeToo movement. Season One told the serviceable, if overwrought story of the tenuous alliance that forms between longtime morning show anchor Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) and newcomer Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon in a wig), an outspoken Rust Belt reporter who’s plucked from obscurity to work alongside her at fictional network UBA after Alex’s longtime co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) is fired during a Lauer-esque scandal. No matter how famous the stars and how big the budget, The Morning Show has retained a cobbled-together quality since it premiered in 2019, remixing thorny recent headlines through a glossy, melodramatic lens that’s more Newsroom-meets-Days of Our Lives than it is Succession — never mind that the morning show-watching monoculture that it prides itself on hasn’t existed in decades. Yet somehow, The Morning Show is better than ever because it’s finally embraced its soapy, unconvincingly ripped-from-the-headlines DNA. Yes, it concerns itself with everything from Covid-19 (no series loves the year 2020 as much as this one) to the Jan. 6 riots. But this is also a show where Billy Crudup delivers lines like “This is a battle for the soul of the universe!” and two of our most well-known actresses film blowout arguments with one another despite absolutely not being in the same room. Why not have some fun with it? So, as the good folks of UBA wrap up another season of newsy chaos, let’s look back on some of The Morning Show’s wildest decisions. The Morning Show’s first season essentially took place in a timeline nearly identical to our own, except theirs had a temporarily brunette Witherspoon and a Gilmore Girls Broadway musical. Sure, the events that inspired its main plot had taken place years earlier in real life, but since they were mapped onto fictional characters, it didn’t matter. However, the show’s poor creatives were thrown for a loop once again thanks to the onset of Covid-19. The Morning Show prides itself on tackling hot-button issues with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, so ignoring the pandemic wasn’t an option. Given that Season One wrapped up in 2019, the writers were given the tough task of catching up with current events by the time Season Two finally came back in the fall of 2021. For better or often worse, The Morning Show ultimately stuck with a media res approach, perpetually stranding its characters at least a year behind our present timeline. In Season Two, that meant spooling the season’s events over the first few months of 2020, sneaking in blunt references to Covid, and forcing us all to relive that awful March — but this time, through the lens of fictional newsroom drama! Season Three improved somewhat on this front, even if the show’s attempts at tying recent traumatic events into melodramatic storylines are usually clumsy at best. Sure, you might remember where you were when you found out that Roe v. Wade was going to be overturned. Now, you can relive that horror alongside your favorite Morning Show characters as they attend a Valentino event! Ah, the magic of television. As someone raised on the Tumblr heyday of the early 2010s, I have witnessed many a queerbait. Back then, it was common for young queer women to joke about trudging through six seasons of a truly woeful CW series on the off chance that said show’s flirty leads would finally exchange a kiss. But as queerness has entered the mainstream more and more, these calls for representation have sparked a newer media trend in which a film or show throws two conventionally hot stars together in queer storylines that seem specifically engineered to capitalize on online shipping culture, chemistry and nuance be damned. The Morning Show, god bless it, has offered up one of the worst examples of this trend through the pairing of Bradley and rival news anchor Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies). On paper, sure! Why not? The Morning Show has become such a fever dream of a show that some gay, inter-network drama should feel right at home. Unfortunately, from the moment they lock lips seemingly out of the blue in Season Two, Witherspoon and Margulies have about as much chemistry with each other as I have with my dental hygienist.  I’m inclined to blame the casting department. The Morning Show loves nothing more than adding a new A-list star to its roster, Infinity Stone-style, and seemingly figuring out what to do with them later. Once Margulies was on board, why bother with a chemistry test?! As the show has progressed, their unconvincing (to the point of verging on homophobia) romance has at least granted the writers opportunities to touch on more nuanced issues like navigating the workplace as a queer woman in a high-profile position, or how classism and wildly different socioeconomic backgrounds can divide a couple. But if we’re sticking with this for the long haul, do some trust-fall exercises ahead of Season Four, I beg! Apart from star power, I couldn’t tell you why Carrell stuck around on The Morning Show after his character Mitch was ousted from morning news once his workplace sexual misconduct came to light. We inexplicably follow him on vacation to Italy in Season Two, where he jumps on an opportunity to “redeem” himself by helping local documentarian Paola work on her film about a wrongfully overturned rape conviction. Thankfully, the show’s bizarre attempts to humanize Mitch didn’t even last an entire season. In Season Two’s seventh episode (titled “La Amara Vita”), he gets into a car accident that sends him flying into Lake Como as gentle piano music plays, which is honestly far more than he deserved. What if instead of spending the early days of the Covid lockdown cringing away from a bunch of celebrities’ rendition of “Imagine,” you were subjected to a livestream of a morning show anchor hacking her way through a positive case? For some reason, this is invaluable journalism in the world of The Morning Show, because interviewing frontline nurses and patients is so overdone. After catching an early Covid case at the end of Season Two, a delirious Alex goes live and somehow wins over the whole of America in the process. “She [suffered] through a biblical plague on live TV to become the one human that people can actually relate to in this shitshow of a so-called democracy,” Cory crows in the Season Three premiere. “Alex Levy is Lazarus.” And I’m closing the New Testament! The Morning Show Season Three opens with a treacly unaired in-memoriam segment dedicated to one Alex Levy. But don’t worry, she didn’t die of Covid. They’re just taking precautions in case she dies in space! That’s right, the latest season kicks off with a ride aboard Elon Musk’s infamous penis-shaped rocket. However, its owner isn’t Elon per se, but a thinly veiled, infinitely more watchable stand-in character named Paul Marks, played by the one and only Jon Hamm.  Amid weaselly CEO Cory’s best attempts to cozy up to Paul, UBA decides to send him and Alex to join Paul on his rocket’s inaugural launch, which will be livestreamed on the network. After Alex ditches her team following an argument with Cory, it’s Bradley who ultimately leaves the stratosphere alongside the two men.  Things get dicey when the rocket’s live feed temporarily cuts out, a tech issue that Paul successfully pins on UBA for most of the season. Luckily, since the first two episodes of Season Three were released simultaneously, viewers only had to wait 30 seconds to learn that (shocker) Witherspoon, Crudup, and Hamm had not been killed off in the premiere after all. Honestly, I’m just impressed that the writers had the restraint to wait until the season finale to make a phallic rocket joke! One thing I will say for The Morning Show? It gives Karen Pittman a hell of a lot more to do than the equally bonkers series And Just Like That…  This year, the show uses the war in Ukraine to tell a wild tale about longtime producer Mia’s (Pittman) love life. Season Three, Episode Five (titled “Love Island”) drags us, poor viewers, back in time to the cursed year 2020 once again, revealing how each of our characters spent lockdown following Alex’s death-defying Covid livestream. At first, Mia found a bright spot in the chaos, entering a quarantine pod with her new flame, a hunky photographer named André (Clive Standen). Their honeymoon phase comes to an abrupt end when André goes out drinking pre-vaccine, sending an understandably pissed Mia out the door. But before they can hash things out, the AP sends André on an assignment to Afghanistan, which lands him on the ground in the Russia-Ukraine war by the time Season Three’s main timeline picks up in the spring of 2022. The two have kept in touch even as André faces increasingly dangerous assignments until he goes radio silent following a hospital bombing. So imagine Mia’s surprise when she discovers that her man is alive and well in America. He let her think he was dead, and in a betrayal that the show seems to take equally seriously, he started working for a rival news network in the meantime. The audacity! If you thought the Amy Robach and TJ Holmes affair scandal seemed like something straight out of The Morning Show, you ain’t seen nothing yet! This year, the show bravely answered the question: “What if Katie Couric dated Elon Musk, but in a prestige-soap-opera way?” Much like how Billy Crudup’s Morning Show performance often carries the essence of the only human in a Muppet movie, Hamm’s suave, shifty performance manages to ground the show in some semblance of reality, no matter how zany things become. Sure, his character Paul Marks is a billionaire with a penis rocket and some questionable secret business practices. But where the actual Musk is immediately smarmy and retaliatory, Paul’s skill at remaining just enigmatic and charismatic enough to mask his shadowy intentions makes him an infinitely more watchable fictional counterpart. Yeah, he’s a baddie who absolutely shouldn’t be getting into bed (in more ways than one) with the on-air talent of the company he’s trying to acquire and secretly strip for parts. But when he aims that sizzling Don Draper charm at Alex for six episodes, it’s easy to shut off your brain and buy into their ill-advised affair. All of The Morning Show’s clunky takes on real-world news were worth it in the end. Why? Because I had the pleasure of experiencing the Bradley Jackson Jan. 6 arc in all its ludicrous, absurdly hilarious glory.  In the Season Three premiere, Bradley receives a journalism award for reporting from inside the Capitol during the 2021 insurrection. It’s all fine and dandy, except for some weird exchanges she keeps having with Cory, with whom she apparently shares a secret. Flash forward to “Love Island,” where we learn that while Bradley was at the Capitol recording footage, she came across a rioter assaulting a police officer, only to discover that said rioter is her brother, Hal (Joe Tippett). To make matters worse, Bradley deletes the incriminating footage of her brother and gets Cory involved in the process. She agrees to turn herself in alongside Hal at the very end of the season, but how exactly we’re supposed to root for her and Alex as principled journalists in Season Four, I have no idea. Still, this blend of baffling current events and ridiculous yet undeniably entertaining melodrama is where The Morning Show is at its most watchable. So, if this show picks up in 2025 with Alex moving into a moon colony and Bradley helping Marianne Williamson secure the Democratic presidential nomination, I’m all in. We want to hear it.

,,"'The Morning Show' Review: Jennifer Aniston Wakes Up with Jon Hamm, Who Channels Elon Musk in Best Season Yet","The Apple TV+ series — also starring Reese Witherspoon, Greta Lee, Billy Crudup, Julianna Margulies and Mindy Kaling — returned Wednesday with the first two episodes of season 3  COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ The Morning Show season 3 is finally here. The series remains Apple TV+’s flagship, an A-list vehicle headed by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and backed by a fabulous supporting cast (Greta Lee, Billy Crudup, Julianna Margulies and, fleetingly, a sharp wedge of cheddar named Mindy Kaling) — all of them having a swell time butting heads in a sleek, expensive production. And you couldn’t get a timelier subject: The behind-the-scenes battles to shore up a foundering network, UBA, and squeeze every last drop of value out of its cash-cow morning program.  But the series has never seemed as cutting-edge or smart as it ought to. Say you pried open an iPhone and found that the guts consisted of springs, screws and tiny ticking discs. That’s The Morning Show. If that hasn’t really changed with season 3 — everything ultimately swings into place with a tidy improbability — this is nonetheless the series’ best go-round yet. For one thing, the show has disposed of Steve Carell's problematic Mitch (and that exasperating Italian woman!) and brought in Jon Hamm, sleek as a seal, as an Elon Musk-like tycoon, Paul Marks, who wouldn’t mind adding UBA to his tool box. Hamm underplays seductively — when doesn’t he? — as the plot digs into the juicy topic of whether new tech can or should rescue “legacy” media. The endless maneuverings and counter-maneuverings to clinch the deal or scuttle it are entertaining, engrossing and brisk. COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ They also give Crudup’s Cory Ellison and Lee’s Stella Bak, as UBS’ toughest tactical minds, ample opportunity to steal scenes. Like mice, they find entryways everywhere. Marks is initially skeptical of the corporate value of Aniston’s superstar anchor, Alex Levy — “What is this Alex Levy magic?” he asks — but he soon feels differently. (Imagine if Musk had rebranded Twitter “XO.”)   Aniston’s performance remains casually glamorous, occasionally sinewy and from time to time biting, although she also pouts adorably, as if she were one of director Greta Gerwig’s Barbies struggling to overcome a pesky patch of cognitive dissonance. And that’s fine — this is Alex Levi, not Lydia Tár. The one performer who’s at a disadvantage this season is the fiercely committed Witherspoon as Bradley Jackson. In a flashback episode that places Bradley in Washington, D.C. on Jan. 6, 2020 — inside the Capitol Building itself — she makes a disastrous, spur-of-the-moment decision that could end up destroying her career.  APPLE TV+ Unfortunately, this ripped-from-the-headlines scenario, dramatizing a crucial moment when the tectonic plates of American politics and culture crunched against each other, is a lot less interesting than the question of whether Hamm and Aniston are going to cook at home or order in.  This tends to be a problem with The Morning Show. Its attempts to grapple with actual current events are commendable, and maybe even essential and unavoidable, but seldom satisfactory: Current events (at least the ones America is going through these days) really do require grappling — cut and thrust, argument, friction — but there’s no real debate going on on The Morning Show, just perceived media wisdom grafted onto a plot. The season will also cover the leak of the Supreme Court papers that became the landmark 2022 decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, yet here, too, you may still be more interested in whether Hamm and Aniston are going to cook at home or just order in. All in all, the show is closer to Carrie Bradshaw than Logan Roy: Alex, in a moment of emotional crisis, cries in a closet surrounded by so many shoes, Imelda Marcus would swoon in ecstasy.

,,Jennifer Aniston urges fans to support Matthew Perry Foundation: ‘He would have been grateful for all the love’," Jennifer Aniston extended support to the Matthew Perry Foundation, an organisation formed to help those battling with addiction, formed a week after her Friends co-star's death. Jennifer urged her followers to support the foundation and help Matthew's family with growing the foundation in his honour. (Also Read: Matthew Perry's estate to play a major role in deciding the future of Friends) Jennifer Aniston took to her Instagram Stories on Tuesday to share a post of the official Instagram handle of the Matthew Perry Foundation on their initiative ‘Giving Tuesday’. She wrote in the caption, “For #GivingTuesday, please join me and Matty's family in supporting this foundation - which is working to help those suffering with addiction (white heart emoji). He would have been grateful for the love (feeling loved emoji).” Jennifer had opened up on Matthew's death in an Instagram post on November 15. She wrote in the caption, ""Matty, I love you so much and I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day… sometimes I can almost hear you saying “could you BE any crazier?” Less than a week after his death, a foundation was established in the name of Matthew Perry to help people dealing with addiction. “In the spirit of Matthew Perry’s enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction, we embark on a journey to honour his legacy by establishing the Matthew Perry Foundation, guided by his own words and experiences, and driven by his passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible,” said the inaugural statement establishing the Matthew Perry Foundation. The Emmy-nominated Friends star often spoke publicly about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. The foundation, which has been accepting donations, cited his desire to be remembered as someone who helped others with substance abuse even more than his sitcom stardom. The foundation will be maintained by the National Philanthropic Trust.  Matthew was declared dead at age 54 after paramedics found him unresponsive at his Los Angeles home on October 28.

,,Apple is getting ready for prime time,"If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. I’m trying to remember the last time a company’s big event came for prime-time TV the way Apple’s 8PM ET keynote is trying to lock down our attention tomorrow. The only company I can think of that’s done it successfully lately is Victoria’s Secret with its fashion show. While I suspect there’s some overlap in audience between that and an Apple keynote, I also suspect Bella Hadid is a bigger draw than a new iMac. But Apple is still going for it! Promising a keynote that will air on its website, YouTube, and over Apple TV while things like Monday Night Football air on broadcast TV. The company is ready to take all the cultural cache its phones, Bluetooth headsets, and computers have earned it and convert that fan base into a bigger audience to advertise its products. This big prime-time Apple event feels like the natural next step for the company. No one else in the tech space has had the same success as Apple at getting people to treat their announcements as big events. Nearly every single major tech company has tried. Sony had Taylor Swift at a CES keynote, and Samsung marched out a member of BTS to applause at a Galaxy Unpacked event. Google had the Slo Mo Guys. Intel had dancers and acrobats festooned in LEDs. But something about an Apple event seems to resonate more with folks. And after the iPhone event, it feels pretty clear the company has come close to the pinnacle of what it can do with an hour-long midday infomercial. One of the only ways to get bigger, grab more attention, and become a more consistent part of the conversation is to go prime time (or buy a social media company and run it into the ground). Take that impeccably produced product that captures the attention of techies and a few of their closest friends and move it to a time of night when a whole lot more of those close friends can watch. And Apple is probably doing it now, instead of with the iPhone, because the stakes are lower. Fewer people care about a Mac event than an iPhone one. My brother calls me before an iPhone event to chat about the phones. He doesn’t do that nearly as often for a Mac one. Plus, the iPhone event can dramatically affect Apple’s share price. A spec bump for the MacBook Pro, while welcome, probably won’t move the needle as dramatically. I can’t guarantee fewer people will tune in to this event than the iPhone event last month, but I expect Apple’s less concerned with breaking its viewership records. (The company doesn’t make those public.) Instead, I’d hazard Apple is thinking about next year’s keynotes — especially any centered around the Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s going to need every tool at its disposal to make people care about a $3,500 AR and VR headset. If there’s a chance an evening keynote nets more attention than the traditional morning keynote, then Apple’s going to want to take it when it’s trying to sell people on why AR and VR are the future of computing. So why not do a test run with a series of Mac updates that wouldn’t really benefit from the traditional keynote where hundreds of reporters and analysts fly to Cupertino to sit in a theater and watch a video before going hands-on with the products? But it will need to be one heckuva show. Tim Cook is going to need to do more than come out in an AFC Richmond kit with a Ted Lasso mustache spirit-gummed to his upper lip. The announcements (at least the rumored ones) aren’t going to be enough. I suspect that, in addition to those rumored Mac updates, we’ll also see more skits like that one from the iPhone event starring Octavia Spencer as Mother Earth. It probably won’t be as star-studded, given SAG-AFTRA is currently on strike and bargaining with Apple, among other studios. So there probably won’t be a series of cameos from the actors of Apple’s best-known shows and films. Which means no Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon doing the Apple equivalent of an SNL digital short with Eddy Cue or Adam Scott and Patricia Arquette staring at each other from across a table for an unsettling amount of time before Craig Federighi interrupts as the newest member of the Severance program and shows off an iMac. But maybe Martin Scorsese will show off how easy it is to access his new Letterboxd account on a MacBook Pro. Or maybe half the keynote will be rendered in the video game Resident Evil Village (naturally made on a Mac). Regardless, I’m still assuming Apple will go in a more creative direction because besides the company wanting to test run keynotes at new times, it’s also increasingly showing off its Hollywood ambitions. We heard rumors of its ambitions earlier this year when Bloomberg reported the company was looking to spend approximately $1 billion on new film programming a year. Now, its films, like Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon, are contenders for the Oscars. (It snagged its first Academy Awards last year for Coda.) Earlier this week, Apple TV Plus even saw its second price hike since launch (alongside a slew of other Apple services). The company wants people associating it with entertainment. It would be wild for its very first prime-time event to ignore that entire side of its business just to show off some new M3 iMacs. Apple can’t just give us a time-shifted keynote. Well, it can... but that won’t really match its ambitions. FEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE Lenovo is at MWC 2023 to make a pitch for a rollable future.

,,Apple TV+'s 'Morning Show' is running better than ever as it enters Season 3," David Bianculli The Morning Show enriches itself in its latest season by adding Jon Hamm to the cast and boring more deeply into a few major issues, including institutional racism and blackmail by computer hackers.  DAVE DAVIES, HOST: This is FRESH AIR. ""The Morning Show"" is back. The Apple TV+ series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as on-air talent for the fictional UBA Network. The first two episodes of the new third season premiered last week. Among the show's changes this season, ""Mad Men"" star Jon Hamm is a new cast member. Our TV critic David Bianculli has this review. DAVID BIANCULLI, BYLINE: The second season of the Apple TV+ series ""The Morning Show"" ended with the employees and executives of a fictional UBA Network fighting their way through various crises, including the outbreak of COVID and a variety of corporate and personal scandals and dramas. To begin Season 3, ""The Morning Show"" producers, led by series creator Jay Carson and series developer Kerry Ehrin, jumped the action forward two years. More and more TV shows are pulling this trick. It allows them to reboot the narrative, delay the explanation and exposition and reveal the storylines not only by moving forward but by flashing back. I'll skip the flashback elements. As for ""The Morning Show"" going forward, the show's crisis mode has only accelerated. This year it's dialed up to 11. Jon Hamm plays Paul Marks, an Elon Musk-type billionaire. And his interest in acquiring UBA throws everything and everyone into disarray. It's a deal initially brokered under the radar and behind the scenes by UBA executive Cory Ellison, played by Billy Crudup with all sorts of masterful shadings of bravado and insecurity. Cory has gotten Paul to make a bid for UBA, but at a price. Paul has made a backdoor deal with Cory for his UBA star talent Alex Levy, played by Jennifer Aniston, to take a live televised trip with Paul on the maiden voyage of Paul's personal space shuttle. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MORNING SHOW"") JON HAMM: (As Paul Marks) UBA is on the bubble. COVID saved your ass. And I am offering a 20% premium on top of market value, and you are lucky to get that. BILLY CRUDUP: (As Cory Ellison) You are lucky to get me 'cause I built a [expletive] pyramid during a pandemic. That's undeniable and so am I. HAMM: (As Paul Marks) You started a streaming platform at the end of a global lockdown. Care to speculate what might happen when the world decides it's time to get back to business? CRUDUP: (As Cory Ellison) Well, I'm starting with launching the first female journalist into space. Haven't you heard? HAMM: (As Paul Marks) I'm launching her. It's my rocket. CRUDUP: (As Cory Ellison) She's my journalist. BIANCULLI: It's not long before Alex finds out about the deal and her part in it. She confronts Cory, who tries to defend himself by explaining things from his perspective. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MORNING SHOW"") CRUDUP: (As Cory Ellison) The world as we know it is over, Alex. We are officially in the Thunderdome. In five years, half of the streaming services, they'll be gone or bought out. In 10 years, the internet will be 3D. You will literally be in people's living rooms. We need to build a time machine to take us to the future, and that is going to take real deep pockets, someone with more money than God. And Bill Gates, he won't return my call since I crushed him in doubles at Sun Valley. So Paul Marks - that's the hand that we have been dealt in this game of three-card capitalism. And honestly, I'm happy to be at the table. I want to play. I want to win. In fact, I want to build something that matters even when nothing else does. JENNIFER ANISTON: (As Alex Levy) With that guy? That's who you see for the future of UBA - some need-for-speed hard ass from Silicon Valley. CRUDUP: (As Cory Ellison) Well, we don't like his offer, we walk away. Alex, I mean, come on. You could just trust that I'm doing what's best for you. ANISTON: (As Alex Levy) Right. I do. I forget that. I forget that you always have my best interest at heart. BIANCULLI: ""The Morning Show"" always has been a little over the top, but this season, it enriches itself by boring more deeply into a few major issues - the infighting of corporate intrigue, the exposing of institutional racism, the overwhelming cruelty of social media postings, and in a particularly intense subplot, the attack on UBA by blackmailing computer hackers. The first episodes of Season 3, available now, dive into all of that and give its new and returning players a very deep pool in which to swim. Last season, it was Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon who made the serious moments of ""The Morning Show"" land so well. They're still doing excellent work here, and this season, at the start, so is Crudup as Cory, whose empire is striking back. And it's also true of some co-stars who were given more central plotlines - Holland Taylor as a senior UBA board member and Greta Lee as Stella, whose management position becomes increasingly untenable. Add to that the new contributions by Jon Hamm and others and you have a ""Morning Show"" that's running better than ever. I'm talking, of course, about the one on Apple TV+. The one on UBA? That one's a train wreck, but like its Apple TV+ counterpart, it's always an entertaining one. DAVIES: David Bianculli is professor of television studies at Rowan University. He reviewed the new season of ""The Morning Show"" on Apple TV+. On tomorrow's show, we speak with comedian, writer and actor Aparna Nancherla. Her new book of essays is part memoir and part cultural commentary. She writes about her life and career and the anxiety and depression she often talks about in her stand-up. I hope you can join us.

When last seen in season two, Jennifer Aniston’s Alex Levy had turned her bout with COVID-19 into must-see TV and a streaming show called “Alex Unfiltered,” in which she could fire questions at world leaders. Meanwhile, Reese Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson fulfilled her ambition to anchor the UBA Evening News, watched mostly by grandparents of the preferred youth demographic. While Alex and Bradley think deep thoughts, the fictional Morning Show cedes its ratings-friendly frivolity to weatherman Yanko Flores (Nestor Carbonell) and newcomer Chris Hunter (Nicole Beharie), the latter an Olympic gold medalist smarting over being told to smile and look pretty. The devil remains CEO Cory Ellison, played by Billy Crudup – still the only acting Emmy winner on the series – whose demonic dazzle just keeps getting more brash and beguiling. Corey knows legacy TV is on the ropes and the only way to get board chairman Cybil Richards (the great Holland Taylor) off his back is to find a buyer for UBA.  Enter Elon Musk. Actually, it’s “Mad Men” hottie Jon Hamm as Paul Marks, a tech billionaire who wants to buy the beleaguered network and sell it off for spare parts to finance his personal space program. He’d also like to rocket Alex into bed. Though the star-on-star chemistry between Aniston and Hamm truly sizzles, it’s tricky business for the icons they’re playing. The same goes for Bradley’s on-and-off romance with outed journalist Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies). Their affair triggers a conflict about Bradley’s addict brother, Hal (Joe Tippett), and a plot thread about the January 6 insurrection that proves too thorny for this series to handle. Season three does way better with the inter-office tensions ignited by a data hack that goes viral about UBA salaries, performance reviews, and racist and sexist comments. Cheers to Karen Pittman as showrunner Mia Jordan, and especially to Greta Lee, the radiant star of “Past Lives,” who crushes every scene as Stella Bak, the news chief with a killer instinct at war with her sense of fair play. As ever, “The Morning Show” juggles more balls than it can keep airborne, but at least it’s onto something about our broken media landscape. Sure, the series lacks the financial savvy of “Billions,” the satirical bite of “Network” and the brutal artistry of “Succession,” which shows familial corruption eating away at business and personal ethics. But it’s in there pitching. You can feel it in the way UBA journalists resist the lid advertisers put on reporting about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and the racial animosity at the core of reshaping voting rights. All this, in a series critically drubbed for its lightweight content and watchable stupidity.  Season three makes a solid case for reassessing “The Morning Show” as more than escapist fun passing as social commentary. Former showrunner Kerry Ehrin has ceded control to Charlotte Stoudt, though with Mimi Leder staying on as lead director, the focus is stronger than ever on the challenges women face in the workplace. Aniston has never been better, letting us see the cost to Alex as she walks the tightrope between ambition and becoming someone she can’t recognize. As she and Witherspoon face each other in the tenth and final season three episode, Alex and Bradley enter a world of squeezed options that is all too recognizable as our own. Behind this look at airbrushed, on-air personalities disseminating news filtered through the politics and greed of corporate high-rollers lies a sense that the truth matters, and that fighting for it is a laudable way to face the future. Fantasy? Maybe. But also quietly revolutionary. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/review-morning-show-season-3-jennifer-aniston/story?id=103182643,
,,‘Friends’ Stars Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer Reunite in Super Bowl Ad,"        All of Us remember Ross and Rachel, but Jennifer Aniston has some trouble recognizing Friends costar David Schwimmer in an ad set to air during the 2024 Super Bowl. Aniston, 54, is on set when an assistant brings her UberEats delivery, noting she didn’t realize the app delivered more than food. “Well, you know what they say: in order to remember something, you’ve gotta forget something else, make a little room,” Aniston shares in the commercial, which debuted on Tuesday, February 6.  Unfortunately, memories of Schwimmer, 57, appear to be what’s left her mind. The actor approaches Aniston and tries to pull her into a hug but she backs away. “Have we met?” Aniston asks. “Give me a hint.” The pair, of course, starred as love interests Ross Gellar and Rachel Green on Friends from 1994 to 2004. Aniston, however, can’t seem to recall their 10 seasons of TV together. Schwimmer says, “We worked together for 10 years.” “10 years? You were great,” she lies. Disappointed, Schwimmer asks, “You still don’t know, do you?” “I don’t,” Aniston confesses before turning away. “Like I’d forget 10 years of my life.” “I hate this town,” Schwimmer mumblesto himself. The tagline of the commercial reads, “Whatever you forget, remember UberEats gets anything.” Aniston and Schwimer aren’t the only forgetful stars in the UberEats ad. Jelly Roll is surprised that he has tattoos on his face while Usher can’t even remember his Super Bowl halftime show. Meanwhile, David and Victoria Beckham can’t recall the name of the Spice Girls, offering “Basil Babes,” “Cinnamon Sisters” and “Paprika Gals” as possible monikers. The Beckhams hinted at Aniston’s involvement in a January 30 teaser for the ad. The pair’s viral Rolls-Royce conversation from Netflix’s Beckham docuseries inspired the clip. “So David and I are gonna be in a little commercial,” Victoria, 49, said. David, 48, then poked his head into the room to say, “Be honest, be honest!” The designer conceded that they are in “a big commercial” which will air during “the big baseball game.” The couple then question if maybe the event is the “hockey bowl” instead. “Jessica Aniston is gonna be in it, too,” Victoria added, while David gushed, “We love Jessica.” The commercial mimicked a viral moment from Beckham, which debuted in October 2023. While speaking about her and her husband’s backgrounds, Victoria said they both had “parents who work really hard” and referred to her family as “very working, working class,” in one interview before David barged in to correct her. “Be honest,” he told Victoria, to which she responded, “I am being honest.” David asked, “What car did your dad drive you to school in?”  After first claiming there was “not a simple answer” and later switching gears to “it depends,” Victoria eventually said what David wanted her to admit: “OK. In the ‘80s, my dad had a Rolls-Royce.” Victoria wears a “my dad had a Rolls-Royce” T-shirt in the new UberEats ad. She designed the $150 top in November.

,,Why Can’t We Quit “The Morning Show”?,"  The enduring appeal of “The Morning Show” has become one of the great mysteries of modern television. The Apple TV+ series, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as onetime hosts of a “Today”-like breakfast program titled “The Morning Show,” is simultaneously ripped from the headlines and bewildering to anyone who’s lived through them—in the span of a single episode, Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson chases a story about the erosion of abortion rights and is sent into space live on air. Among critics and casual viewers alike, the response has been one of bafflement and delight. “The morning show is absolutely unlike any tv show I’ve ever seen,” the novelist Rumaan Alam wrote, on X. “It’s like getting a lobotomy, it’s past camp, there should be academics working on this.” The third season, which concluded earlier this month, addressed the war in Ukraine (via a producer’s tortured love affair with a war photographer), the Capitol riot (in which a recurring character was an active participant), and the tyranny of tech billionaires (by having Aniston’s Alex Levy sleep with one of them). Needless to say, it’s already been renewed for a fourth. “The Morning Show” was supposed to be more than a hate-watch. First announced in 2017, the glossy project—an adaptation of the media critic Brian Stelter’s best-selling book “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV”—was meant to lend Apple’s then-fledgling streaming service instant credibility, in the way that “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black” had done for Netflix. (Personally, I had hoped for a sharp, self-aware exploration of the gilded cage of female likability—a subject that Aniston and Witherspoon, both erstwhile America’s Sweethearts, probably have a lot to say about.) Then NBC’s Matt Lauer was terminated amid accusations of sexual harassment and assault—he admitted to causing “damage” at the network but denied a rape allegation—and a new showrunner, Kerry Ehrin, refashioned “The Morning Show” into a #MeToo melodrama. Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), Alex’s beloved co-anchor, served as Lauer’s fictional counterpart; the series began with the exposure of his crimes, then traced the aftermath of his public dethroning. But the show’s efforts to grapple with these themes eventually tipped into absurdity, not least because of its seeming determination to rehabilitate Mitch. Toward the end of the second season, after spending months in self-imposed exile at an Italian villa, he killed himself by driving off a cliff. In that deeply unserious moment, the new “Morning Show” was born. Goodbye, well-intentioned disappointment. Hello, unexpectedly riveting perversion of endless potential. Alam is right that “The Morning Show” is a unique creation: an objectively bad show that’s somehow also must-watch television. If it falls short of the elevated fare it was meant to be, it owes its appeal to a genre the golden age forgot. The landscape of prestige TV is littered with gritty fantasy series, antihero sagas, and melancholy comedies—but the auteurs of the era have largely left the melodrama untouched. Attempts to repurpose its signature pleasures—namely soapy plotting and immoderate emotionality—have turned out sludgy and self-serious (“Damages,” “Bloodline”) or, once the novelty wears off, numbingly repetitive (“Scandal”). Enter “The Morning Show,” whose heightened characters and approach to very recent history betray its true lineage. Where “The Newsroom,” on HBO, used hindsight for point-scoring and piety—Aaron Sorkin’s avatar routinely made the “right” calls where his real-world counterparts had failed—and “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight,” on CBS and Paramount+, respectively, merged the topical and the theatrical to reflect the absurdities of the present moment, “The Morning Show” mines current events almost exclusively for drama. They’re deployed most often as a source of personal or professional tension—Alex bristles when the in-universe news of her affair with the billionaire Paul Marks (Jon Hamm) eclipses the fall of Roe v. Wade, but the series itself is, naturally, more concerned with the former. To be so close and yet so far from our own world lands us in an emotional and narrative uncanny valley. The use of politics as set dressing has its drawbacks. The show is at its most vexingly coy when it declines to nail down queer West Virginian Bradley’s position on the ideological spectrum, and when it skirts the implications of her brother Hal’s involvement in the Capitol insurrection, which matters only to the extent that it threatens her job and his ability to be present as a father. Whether he believes her to be another venal élitist peddling lies about the outcome of the 2020 election never comes up. But it is perhaps that degree of remove from reality that’s proved so compelling, even as the writers make choices that defy basic storytelling logic. The unlikely friendship between the rough-hewn, perpetually indignant Bradley and the polished, cynical veteran Alex is meant to be the heart of the show—so of course they’re separated for most of the third season, with Alex now the host of a streaming series called “Alex Unfiltered” and Bradley the face of the network’s evening news. Lurching wildly in the quality of its story lines and its treatment of serious issues, “The Morning Show” makes for a uniquely destabilizing viewing experience. From scene to scene, I find myself thinking about it the way one might about an erratic boyfriend: Are things good now? Is this bad patch worth pushing through? Am I an idiot for subjecting myself to this? I’ve become as engrossed by these questions as I am by anything onscreen, and I have a different answer every ten minutes. The January 6th subplot had me howling with incredulousness, then giddily enraptured. Despite, or maybe because of all this, the show is a hit. It’s one of the only Apple TV+ series to crack the Nielsen Top Ten—a success aided, no doubt, by the millions lavished on every frame. Aniston and Witherspoon don’t come cheap, and the gleaming cinematography lends an enviable lustre to both the Gen X cast members and the many elaborate sets. When Bradley briefly leaves Earth in a rocket ship—accompanied by her boss, Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), the head of the network, and Paul, who’s using the suborbital trip as free advertisement for his space-travel firm—and all three actors float about in microgravity, the streamer seems to be showing off. As in any good soap opera, the characters themselves are the reason to keep watching, and their consistently questionable choices have taken on genuine thematic weight: the series has become a meditation on the price of survival. Bradley, who started off as an unrelenting idealist, has since been compromised by her own ambitions, having engaged in a coverup to preserve her career even at the cost of her relationship and her values. Alex, despite having rebranded after the scandal surrounding Mitch, is still plagued by an instinct to adjoin herself to a powerful man—first Cory, then Paul—instead of forging her own path. Aniston’s portrayal of a woman who’s only ever gained power by appeasing various male executives has been the best performance of her career. Cory, too, has always felt one wrong move away from catastrophic ruin. His decisions tend to come as grenades, and the writers evidently relish penning his lines of grandiose thunder; Crudup, who plays him with a rictus grin rivalling that of the Joker, is regularly given pronouncements such as “I want death in the afternoon!” and “Alex Levy is Lazarus, and that makes me Jesus, except I’m in more houses seven days a week.” But the third season rounds him out with an embittered, mercurial mother (Lindsay Duncan, in a very Lindsay Duncan role) who appears to be both the root and the first victim of his transactional world view. Most satisfyingly, Cory develops a genuine protectiveness toward his staff once he finally accepts that he can’t be a chaos agent and an effective leader at the same time. He still irritates the people around him as often as he charms them, but the sheer volume of quips per minute and the absolute conviction with which they’re delivered are undeniable. He thrives in self-made bedlam; whatever the circumstances, he manages to carry off a heady mix of self-indulgence and self-importance. In other words, he’s prime “Morning Show” material. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death. Who owns London’s most mysterious mansion?

,,The stars on The Morning Show look insane," Jennifer Aniston officially went overboard with cosmetic surgery. She’s got puppet mouth and constantly looks surprised or angry because all the face lifts have stretched her eyes wide open. They probably don’t close all the way when she’s asleep. The woman is 54 years old and there is not a single line on her face. It’s bumming me out. Then there’s Nestor Carbonelli (the weatherman) who is not only wearing too much eyeliner but also now more mascara than Lady Gaga. Check out his short scene in S03E02 if you don’t believe me. The vanity of these people. Jennifer and Reese appear to have filters on their face when no one else does and it’s really distracting. Nestor has very dark and thick lashes, so he's always looked like he's wearing mascara (seriously check out all his work dating back to the 90s). But yes, Jennifer and Reese both have heavy filters. Its uncanny. I remember he got asked about it all the time back when he was on Lost and getting called the Maybeline Man. It must have got annoying after a while. Not that I'm not insanely jealous. Jennifer Aniston takes amazing care of herself. She looks awesome. Yes and she doesn’t need filters or anymore surgery. Well Jennifer’s face makes sense, she is always angry in the show Her body, her choice. Let’s not shame women for their looks 🤷‍♀️ I agree. I've quite surprised by the number of attacks on appearance I've seen in this subreddit. I honestly think it's digitally altered, like they did roto smoothing on her skin. It's unnatural and so distracting!! I do think it is strange filtering on Jen and Reese's faces. Everything looks a little smooth in their close ups, different lighting and such used. I don't know what it is, but it looks unnatural this season.          ",www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMorningShow/comments/16mdswi/the_stars_on_the_morning_show_look_insane/,

,,Not Really Jennifer Aniston Salad,"BY SNEH | 9 COMMENTS
PUBLISHED 25 JUN '22 | UPDATED 27 OCT '23  This is that viral, healthy and deliciously easy salad that Jennifer Aniston may or may not have eaten every single day for 10 years on the set while filming Friends. Packed with protein and crunch, this quinoa, chickpeas and veg salad can be made in just about 20 minutes. I have it for lunch at least once a week! Now don't quote me on this but back when social media started picking up, what Jennifer Aniston ate while filming Friends was a hot topic of contention. The media has always been fascinated by Rachel Green's hairstyles and outfits. In the same way, the internet has always obsessed over Jennifer Aniston's favourite salad. Courtney Cox remembers a turkey bacon and garbanzo bean (that's chickpea for us here in Australia!) salad that Jennifer Aniston used to make every day. This claim has been refuted by Jennifer herself over the years. And I believe her. Here's why ... The viral Jennifer Aniston Salad has copious amounts of raw onion, which I am assuming would be a strict no-no while shooting due to the pungency of the ingredient. I mean, if I was shooting in close proximity with other actors, I wouldn't want my breath to smell of onion. However, in 2015 when Jennifer took over a famous brand's Instagram account for the day, she shared her perfect everyday salad recipe. It had chickpeas, bulghur, cucumbers, parsley, mint, red onion, feta cheese and pistachios. And that is where the legend of the infamous Jennifer Aniston Salad began. Over the years, it has been reimagined and shared across many websites. My version is gluten-free because I swapped bulghur out for quinoa and it also has a little something extra - garlic! A can of chickpeas in the pantry and a container of cooked quinoa in the fridge form the base of this super easy, nourishing Jennifer Aniston salad. Here is what you will need. Chickpeas - Canned chickpeas are great. Just rinse and use. You can substitute with canned black beans or cannellini beans. Quinoa - When I cook quinoa using this recipe, I use half white and half multicolored quinoa to get a pot of fluffy mixed quinoa that works really well in salads. Not only does it look good but the red quinoa adds more texture and bite. It eliminates the stodginess that comes from using only white quinoa. If gluten isn't an issue, you can substitute quinoa with bulghur or couscous. Veggies - Onion and cucumber should be chopped really fine. You don't need to deseed the cucumber for this recipe. Herbs - Lots of parsley and mint, chopped really fine. I often don't add mint and the salad is just as delicious. Cheese - Lots of sharp crumbly feta cheese is the ideal salad for this recipe. Nuts - Toasted chopped pistachio nuts add a lovely crunch. You can substitute with toasted and chopped almonds or brazil nuts. Dressing - The Jennifer Aniston Salad requires a good amount of acidity that comes from squeezing two whole lemons. I make a basic salad vinaigrette with olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. It is punchy and refreshing. 1. Toast whole, raw pistachios in a dry cast-iron pan on low-medium heat, tossing constantly to avoid burning. Toast for 3-4 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat and cool slightly. 2. Using a knife, chop the toasted pistachios roughly. 3. Cook quinoa in a pot. Remove from heat and cool completely. 4. Rinse and drain canned chickpeas in a colander. 5. Chop onion, cucumber, parsley and mint as per the recipe. 6. Make the dressing by mixing all the ingredients for the dressing in a lidded glass jar and shaking really well. 7. Add chickpeas, quinoa, onion, cucumber, parsley, mint, toasted pistachios and feta cheese to a large bowl. 8. Add the salad dressing to the bowl and mix all the ingredients really well until everything is evenly coated with the dressing. One of the best things about this Jennifer Aniston Salad is that it is a complete meal in itself with a good amount of protein, fiber, carbs and good fats. Here are some more delicious ways of serving it, It doesn't matter what nuts you use in this recipe, make sure you toast them. Toasting any nut really brings out the flavour of that nut. Toasted nuts also become crunchier. When you add them to the salad, they add a lovely crunch and texture even when mixed with the dressing. On the other hand, raw nuts just become chewier. This salad is a complete vegetarian meal by itself. It has lots of protein from chickpeas, quinoa, feta and nuts. Olive oil ticks the good fats category. Veggies and herbs add fiber and other important nutrients. It is a light, low-calorie meal (only 305 kcal per serve). Unfortunately, lentils won't work in this recipe. When making and eating a salad, you want to have a bite and crunch with every mouthful. Cooked lentils are much softer than chickpeas. They are also closer in size to quinoa. Adding lentils will make your salad mushy and uninteresting. Instead, try substituting with firm legumes like canned black beans (they are the most accurate substitute for chickpea in a salad because of their firm texture and sweet nutty taste). Cannellini beans are another good substitute for chickpeas. Once mixed, the Jennifer Aniston Salad can be stored in an air-tight, lidded, glass container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Yes, you sure can! Chop the veggies and herbs, toast and chop the nuts and make the dressing. Store all three in separate containers in your fridge until ready to use. This salad prep can be done up to 3 days in advance. Are you looking for delicious new ways to cook with canned chickpeas?

I reduced the amount of red onion for personal preference and used roast almonds as I had them, turned out fresh and yum. Thank you! Can you mix together when the quinoa is still warm? Hi Kayla, you can while still warm but I would recommend letting quinoa cool down for at least 15 minutes after cooking. Quinoa is quite sticky and mushy while still hot/warm and the texture in any salad is much better when quinoa has cooled a bit and is dry and fluffy. If pressed for time, I remove a cup or two of cooked quinoa in a wide-rimmed bowl, spread it and pop in the fridge for 5-10 minutes and it is perfect for adding to salads. Made it twice in four days - addicted ! Awesome! It’s so easy, isn’t it? Delicious! Did it with couscous asked all the herbs! Thank you so much. So lovely to get your newsletter. Plus all the herbs - darn auto correct and my rubbish typing 🙂 Very nice! Couscous sounds amazing This looks DELICIOUS! Can't wait to give this a whirl! Thank you.

,,Jennifer Aniston shares sweet story of the Friends cast's pre-fame Las Vegas trip," When Jennifer Aniston sat down with Ellen DeGeneres to discuss her upcoming projects like the Apple series The Morning Show, conversation between old friends quickly turned to conversation about Friends. It all started on Wednesday’s episode of DeGeneres’ talk show, when she pulled up an old snapshot of the Friends cast that Courteney Cox posted on Instagram recently and asked Aniston to explain. “Oh, aren’t we so cute? That was a trip to Las Vegas before the show aired,” Aniston recalled. “Jimmy Burrows, our director, decided, he said, ‘I want to take the cast to Vegas and I want to take them to dinner.’ And he took us to dinner at Spago at Caesar’s palace, and we were like, ‘We’re so fancy.’” Once Burrows had gathered the group, he gave a serious speech in which he predicted that Friends would be a hit and that their lives would never be the same. “‘This world can be pretty dark, and you guys gotta really stick together and take care of each other,’” Aniston recalled Burrows saying. “And we took that to heart for sure, obviously. And then he handed us each a couple hundred bucks and said, ‘Now go into the casino and go gamble because this is the last time you’ll be able to walk into a casino anonymously.’ And we had no clue what he was talking about… and sure enough, that was the last time we were able [do that].” DeGeneres went on to ask Aniston to make a Friends revival happen, to which the actress enthusiastically responded, “I would do it.” Aniston added that “the girls” (Cox and Lisa Kudrow) and “the boys” (Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer) “would do it, I’m sure. Listen, anything could happen.” And in case anyone can’t make it, DeGeneres volunteered to join the cast as a new next-door neighbor. Watch the video above for more.

,,Jennifer Aniston explains selling ‘The Morning Show’ when Apple TV+ ‘didn’t have walls‘,"The Morning Show is one of the flagship Apple TV+ original shows, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell. In a new interview with Variety, Jennifer Aniston offers new details on working with Apple, the show’s inspiration, and more.  Aniston explains that Apple originally acquired The Morning Show based purely on an outline. Four months after that, however, real-world events including the rise of the Me Too movement forced the show to “start from scratch” with new inspiration drawn from those events. The show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s— hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch. When it comes to working with Apple, Aniston says she had some early “reservations” because the company didn’t “have walls yet or telephones” for its original content efforts: Did you have any reservations selling “The Morning Show” to Apple? “Yes and no. But I have to say the “no” outweighed the “yes,” because we knew what we were doing — even though they didn’t have walls yet or telephones.” Aniston adds that Apple originally came to the Creative Artists Agency about acquiring the show – and that she was excited about being the first show at Apple: “There was really something exciting about being the first at Apple. Apple is pretty awesome. They make cool stuff. Why wouldn’t they maybe make cool television? And they are all about quality, not quantity, so that was really appealing. And in spite of their comical secrecy, it’s been worth it. Who doesn’t want to be part of the Wild Wild West?” Despite her involvement with The Morning Show, Aniston said that she’s “excited” and “shocked” about the state of streaming TV, but that certain aspects of it are sad: “I remember not understanding. What the hell does streaming mean? They’re like, “It’s there all the time.” So tuning in on Thursday nights at eight o’clock is not a thing anymore? Or you’re not going to the bathroom on a commercial break and someone yells, “It’s back on!” That doesn’t happen anymore? It’s kind of sad.” You can read the full interview at Variety for more about the creative side of the show. The Morning Show will premiere on Apple TV+ on November 1st.

,,Jennifer Aniston’s Stunning Sanctuary: Inside the Star’s Gorgeous $21 Million Bel Air Mansion,"        Courtetsy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram (2) Jennifer Aniston‘s home is where her heart is! The actress has given fans various peeks inside of her gorgeous $21 million Bel Air estate ever since she joined Instagram in October 2019. The former Friends star is a self-confessed homebody, and there’s nowhere else she’d rather be than roaming her 8,500-square-foot house she purchased in 2011 and lovingly decorated to her own tastes. During the COVID lockdown when many people were going stir crazy, The Morning Show actress admitted during an April 2, 2020, remote appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she hadn’t left her home in three weeks … and was perfectly fine! “I’m a born agoraphobe,” Jen admitted about being home alone, adding, “This is kind of a dream — not a dream, it’s obviously a nightmare. But me personally, it’s not been that much of a challenge.” Jen went on to describe how she passed the time cleaning out various closets inside her mansion and finding so many incredible pieces of memorabilia that she forgot she had. More than a year later, she admitted to the host on a September 20, 2021, return to Kimmel that, “I’ve been in the house a lot. I’ve rearranged furniture … I went from the set from Sony studios to shoot [The] Morning Show right back to my house.” Before joining Instagram, the actress showed off her house — which she used to share with former husband Justin Theroux before their February 2018 split — on SmartWater’s Instagram, during a one-day account takeover in December 2017. In a series of six photos, Jen showed off her stunning property’s minimalist yet rustic aesthetic, and the Friends actress definitely found the perfect balance between classic and modern design in her home. Fans were lucky to have gotten a glimpse of Jen’s kitchen, two living rooms and part of the exterior of the house but kept some privacy by not showing any photos of her bedroom. Nonetheless, fans were grateful for the little peek showing Jen looking so comfy and cozy at home, especially with her beloved pet dogs.  Her pooches have been one of the main ways that the We’re the Millers star continues to show fans her home via Instagram, along with how she preps for various awards shows. Fans were able to get a look at her massive walk-in closet with numerous wardrobe areas as she was getting fitted in her gown for the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. She also showed off a rare look at her stunning Zen garden-style bathroom and long granite tub after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in February 2020. Scroll down for photos of Jennifer Aniston’s Bel Air mansion.  1 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram Jen gave fans a rare look at her backyard pool and cabana in a June 2023 video where the actress showed she had a beautiful wind chime in honor of her late dog Dolly hanging from a nearby tree. 2 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram Jen posed in her sexy silver minidress on her back patio before heading to the Murder Mystery 2 premiere on March 28, 2023.

In one, she showed him as a fuzzy puppy lying next to the actress as she finished up a home yoga workout. 17 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram The actress got ready for the 2020 Emmys — even though the nominees remained at home and appeared via remote video — by perching on a blue lounger while sipping champagne, as a face mask made her skin smooth as silk. 18 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram The former Friends star gave fans a rare look at her home bathroom, featuring a long, square tub surrounded by Zen garden-like decor, while showing off the Screen Actors Guild Award she won the night before February 2020. 19 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram The actress stood on her deck looking out at her expansive property in her 2020 Golden Globes gown before heading to the January 2020 event in nearby Beverly Hills. 20 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram Jennifer gave fans a peek inside her vast home closet and dressing area as she prepped for the 2020 Golden Globe Awards in a gorgeous black Dior gown. 21 of 27 Courtesy of Jennifer Aniston/Instagram Jen sat on her home’s spotless hardwood floors to cuddle Lord Chesterfield in a Thanksgiving 2020 photo. 22 of 27 Courtesy of Smartwater/Instagram Jen did a takeover of Smartwater’s Instagram account in 2017, where she showed off six photos from inside her $21 million Bel Air estate, along with bottles of the beverage for which she’s the spokeswoman. The actress smiled while sitting on a curved, cozy gray sofa with a fuzzy pillow behind her. On her white wall, a modern gold sculpture with connected circles was visible, as a white orchid plant on her coffee table added a leafy touch. 23 of 27 Courtesy of Smartwater/Instagram During the Smartwater takeover, Jen was seen on the grounds of her mansion, throwing a ball to her Schnauzer mix, Clyde. Her sun deck surrounded by glass fencing was visible behind her. 24 of 27 Courtesy of Smartwater/Instagram Jen sat cuddled up on a creme colored sofa while giving her black and white pit bull Sophie a kiss, as Clyde looked on longingly.

,,Jennifer Aniston Teases 'The Morning Show' Is 'a Lot More Sensual' in Season 3 (Exclusive),"The actress just announced her partnership with Pvolve fitness brand and will advise the company on marketing, product and programming strategy  APPLE TV+ Jennifer Aniston is giving fans of The Morning Show a hint of what’s to come in season 3. “It's a good, juicy one,"" Aniston, 54, teases of the Apple TV+ series' next season. ""Everybody's getting in trouble. Everybody has a secret. And everyone's just walking the line. It's a lot more sensual this year.” ZOEY GROSSMAN The actress and Pvolve fitness brand partner admits she's looking forward to taking a few months off before the season premiere this fall. “In our business, you have to demand the time off or carve it out, because there's always something that's going to pop up. So I think after next week I'm going to take June and July off,” she says. “I've never done that, but I really think I'm going to do it. I’m going to travel because I haven't really since the pandemic. I've become very insular. But it's time to get over that, it’s very easy to fall into agoraphobia after this pandemic. And I refuse to let that happen.” Aniston's involvement with Pvolve (an exercise program that pairs functional movement with resistance-based equipment to sculpt, strengthen and restore the body through on-demand and streaming and in-person classes) will include advising the company on its marketing, product and programming strategy. While she still hikes and does Pilates, she has “hung up the 45 minutes of cardio, the aggressive CrossFits. That didn't, for me, work,” Aniston explains. “And I think for longevity and something that is sustainable and you don't burn out, this just has worked for me.” Her thoughts on wellness, which have evolved over the years, “come down to simplicity,” she says. “It's just calories in, calories out, nutrition, what are you feeding your body? Don't eat crap. You've got to get the right amount of sleep. You've got to drink tons and tons and tons of water. You also have to give yourself the 20 percent of fun and gluttony and have a good time and indulge. For me, I couldn't do that saintly, never go off the rails or deviate from the plan of perfect wellness because I like to enjoy myself.” When it comes to her life now, Aniston feels most proud “that I'm still here? That we're still talking. That we're still interesting in some way. We still have something to offer."" She continues, ""I have the most precious group of girlfriends that I am so madly in love with. I have a beautiful group of friends; loyal, funny, talented, kind. But I would say, that I've made it, I'm here. Doing our best.” Her daily mantra these days is easy: “Find joy. Find joy. Find joy.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

,,The Morning Show Season 3 Release Schedule,"Co-hosts Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are ready to tackle another year of drama. Things are heating up on The Morning Show. Once the flagship Apple TV+ series loosely based on the Matt Lauer Good Morning America scandal, The Morning Show has quickly evolved into something more. Season Three ushers in new challenges for co-hosts Alex (Jennifer Anniston) and Bradley (Reese Witherspoon), following the show's tackling of #MeToo and the Covid-19 pandemic. This season began with some major drama, after the news station was hit by a mysterious cyberattack. As with any data leak, hidden secrets about the show come to light, and Alex and Bradley get caught in the mayhem. Judging by the trailer for the new season, there seems to be some Succession-esque plotting underway—with a new character (played by Jon Hamm) interested in purchasing the news network. ""We are flirting with financial disaster,"" CEO Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) tells Alex in the trailer. ""We need someone with more money than God."" In this week's episode, “White Noise,” an important contract negotiation becomes public and divides the station. The leaked information causes The Morning Show's employees to form unlikely alliances. Amidst the chaos, Chris, a new and scrappy journalist, gets her big break. You can tune in tomorrow, September 20, to see how the episode shakes out. If you’re a bit behind, don’t worry—you can watch previous episodes on Apple TV+. While you’re at it, check out our streaming guide below for instructions on how to watch The Morning Show. The first two episodes of Season Three are already available to watch on Apple TV+, with the remaining six episodes arriving weekly every Wednesday. Deep Impact director Mimi Leder will continue to helm the series, alongside Hillary Clinton's former press secretary Jay Carson and Bates Motel producer Kerry Ehrin. There are eight episodes in Season Three of The Morning Show, with six remaining after the initial two-episode debut on September 13, 2023. We'll keep this list updated as more details emerge.

,,‘Friends’ Star Jennifer Aniston Breaks Down In Tears Over The Thought Of Matthew Perry Dying In Resurfaced 2004 Interview,"                                                        As the world continues to reel from Matthew Perry‘s shocking death, a clip of Jennifer Aniston tearing up over the thought of losing her fellow Friends co-star has resurfaced. Ahead of the taping for the Friends series finale — which aired in 2004 — Aniston, who played Rachel Green on the hit sitcom, sat down with Diane Sawyer. At one point in the interview, the journalist asked the actress to reveal one thing each of her castmates doesn’t know about themselves. When it came time for her to name something Perry, who played Chandler Bing through all 10 seasons, doesn’t know about himself, she said, “That he’s alright.” “He struggled,” Aniston continued as she broke down in tears, referring to her friend’s addiction to drugs and alcohol. “We didn’t know. We, you know, we weren’t equipped to deal with it. Nobody had ever dealt with that. And, you know, the idea of even losing him…” Before Perry died at the age of 54 last weekend, he had been open about his battle with addiction. He previously revealed that he was taking up to 55 Vicodin a day while filming Friends and, at one point, only weighed 128 pounds, per People. In a 2022 interview with Sawyer, the actor gushed over Aniston for sticking by his side throughout the years. “She was the one that reached out the most. You know, I’m really grateful to her for that,” he said, adding that Aniston was the one who confronted him about his addiction while Friends was still filming. “Imagine how scary a moment that was.” While it was scary for him to face his friends, he recalled them banding together to help him through his struggles. “[They] were understanding, and they were patient,” he said. “It’s like penguins. Penguins, in nature, when one is sick, or when one is very injured, the other penguins surround it and prop it up. They walk around it until that penguin can walk on its own. That’s kind of what the cast did for me.” Earlier this week, the core Friends cast — Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc — released a joint statement addressing Perry’s heartbreaking death. “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family,” the statement reads, per People. “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.” It continues, “In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.” If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse, call the SAMHSA National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357.

,,We’d Let Jennifer Aniston Design Our Home,"    Jennifer Aniston has flexed her creative muscles a lot in Hollywood over the years. Of course, she played Rachel Green on Friends and now plays Alex Levy on Apple TV+’s The Morning Show, and she has produced extensively with her production company Echo Films. But it turns out the entertainment industry isn’t the only arena in which Aniston likes to express her creativity. According to a new interview with The Wall Street Journal, interior design is the one profession she’d want to try outside of acting. A look inside the bedroom at Jennifer Aniston’s former Beverly Hills home, as photographed by AD in 2010 “I love putting homes together and creating spaces,” Aniston told WSJ. “I can walk into a house and see what it needs. And it’s a fun process. Some people dread it. It can break up relationships. I thrive during that process.” Aniston has had multiple homes featured by AD over the years, so this predilection isn’t entirely shocking. The first home, featured in a 2010 issue of the magazine, was designed by midcentury architect Harold W. Levitt in 1970. Aniston worked on the property with AD100 interior designer Stephen Shadley to bring it back to its original glory. “The house has a rather glamorous, old-fashioned Hollywood quality,” she told AD in 2010. “I can just imagine the Rat Pack stopping by; someone is playing the piano, and people are laughing in the next room.” This might seem a bit of a stretch, but Shadley and Aniston’s commitment to midcentury details, especially with all those extra large table lamps, makes the Sinatra-era fantasy feel a little less zany. The living room at Jennifer Aniston’s midcentury home, as photographed by AD in 2018 Published in 2018, the second AD-featured home speaks further to her love of midcentury design. The Bel Air structure was designed by acclaimed architect A. Quincy Jones in 1965, and Aniston brought it back to life with Shadley and LA designers Kathleen and Tommy Clements and Jane Hallworth. “Sexy is important, but comfort is essential,” she opined at the time, reflecting her thinking behind the lush textures and cozy furnishings that populate the home. Both homes reflect a devotion to midcentury design’s sophistication that’s tempered by a realistic outlook on what makes a home livable. Though hopefully she learned her lesson on wall-to-wall carpets with this primary bedroom. Needless to say, with these educational experiences of working with such accomplished designers (and certainly others under her belt), we’d count ourselves lucky to have a home designed by Jennifer Aniston. And frankly, we’re just grateful to see a Royère sofa outside of the confines of Kim K’s all-white Hidden Hills manse.

,,Jennifer Aniston revived her iconic Rachel haircut at the 2024 Golden Globes,"Her shorter layered 'do looked elegant paired with a timeless black gown. At last night's 81st Golden Globes, Jennifer Aniston celebrated her signature style in more ways that one. Not only did the actress opt for a very-her timeless black dress (a strapless column gown by Dolce & Gabbana, featuring a fitted bodice and embellished, scalloped skirt – making her one of our best-dressed of the night), but her hairstyle was one that felt similarly synonymous with the star. Indeed, it hailed the return of 'The Rachel' – Aniston's layered long bob that was made so popular by the character she played in the '90s sitcom Friends it immediately became iconic. Endearingly familiar, Jennifer's new shorter haircut fell just below the collarbones, with soft layers enhancing the overall body and bounce. The choppy finish – on the cut and also its straight and piece-y styling – felt very Rachel in season one of Friends (the later episodes). Through bringing it bang up to date for 2024 were her quiet luxury beige-blonde highlights – which looked endlessly elegant on this year's Golden Globes red carpet. As a nominee for the Globes’ Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Series – Drama category, Jennifer represented her acclaimed Apple TV+ drama, The Morning Show, which also stars Reese Witherspoon.

,,‘The Morning Show’ Gets Hacked in Season 3 Trailer,"  The Apple TV+ series is set to premiere Sept. 13. BY RICK PORTER  The first moments of The Morning Show‘s season three trailer look like office politics as usual, with Jennifer Aniston‘s Alex Levy and Billy Crudup’s Cory Ellison arguing over what’s apparently an “unprecedented” ask from Alex. Things take a turn, however, when UBA gets hacked, setting up what looks to be the central crisis for the drama’s coming season, which premieres Sept. 13. While Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) announces the cyberattack on the air, everyone worries about what secrets will come out in its aftermath — and the potential “financial disaster,” as Cory puts it, that could accompany it.  Enter Jon Hamm’s Paul Marks. The Mad Men star will play a tech mogul whose money can help keep UBA solvent but will likely come with strings attached. He also seems to have a past with Alex that raises a few eyebrows within the network. Mark Duplass, Néstor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee and Julianna Margulies all reprise their roles in season three, and Nicole Beharie joins the cast along with Hamm. Charlotte Stoudt (Pieces of Her, Fosse/Verdon) is the showrunner for season three, taking over from Kerry Ehrin (who remains a consultant). Stoudt executive produces with director Mimi Leder; Michael Ellenberg of Media Res; Aniston and Kristin Hahn of Echo Films; and Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter for Hello Sunshine.

,,The Morning Show Uses Some of Jennifer Aniston’s Personal Wardrobe for Season Three,"Plus, more behind-the-scenes intel we gathered from the show’s costume designers “It’s like cooking. It either tastes good or it doesn’t.” That’s how Sophie De Rakoff describes costuming Reese Witherspoon—and she should know, having done the job for over 20 years, on numerous productions since and including 2001’s Legally Blonde. When you’ve been good at something for that long, an instinctual secondhand takes over. Fellow costume designer Debra McGuire had similar things to say about working with Jennifer Aniston over the last 30 years. (McGuire and Aniston first met on the set of Friends.) “There’s just this flow to it that doesn’t exist with other actors,” she told us. It’s rare in Hollywood for a costume designer to have worked so extensively with a single actor, and it’s even rarer for two such designers to work together on a single production. The costuming of season three of The Morning Show is therefore unique: De Rakoff designed three entire episodes of the Apple TV+ drama, as well everything for Witherspoon’s character, Bradley Jackson. McGuire handled Aniston’s character, Alex Levy, exclusively. And a third designer, Beth Lancaster, supported on everything else. This collaborative environment, and the nature of having known your colleagues for over two decades, made for some interesting behind-the-scenes anecdotes—like how the designers were trusted enough to pull pieces from the actors’ personal closets, or how McGuire collaborated with Valentino to re-create one of Aniston’s most iconic red-carpet moments for Alex. They say if you want to go fast, you go alone; and if you want to go far, you go together. Here, we caught up with De Rakoff and McGuire to learn more about how far things can go when creatives get to collaborate. Debra McGuire: We meet Alex in the first season and she’s wearing a lot of buttoned-up suits and pussy bows, and she’s very professional and very sort of hidden in a way. It’s not until the second season and there was a baring of the soul when the wardrobe follows suit, and there’s a different kind of vulnerability. We get into the third season and there’s a confidence that is much more pronounced, and consequently, she doesn’t have to put on a jacket to feel powerful. We see a lot of skin, a lot of arms, a lot of V-necks, more shoulders. DM: Alex wears a Khaite jumpsuit that is strapless, and is pretty amazing. There is an Alexander McQueen pantsuit that is incredible. And when Alex wears a Saint Laurent turtleneck with anything, it’s amazing. We also see Alex in a Valentino gown that was made to be like a gown Jennifer had worn years ago—and because that dress didn’t exist anymore, Valentino made the dress for us again. DM: Here’s the thing: Jennifer is one of the very few actors who really knows herself in terms of her physicality. Often actors will tell you what looks good on them, and as designers, we know that’s not always what is actually the best look for them. But Jennifer is quite exceptional in that she knows exactly what works. I trust her instincts in a way that I [don’t] with any other actor. Just look at her personal decisions she’s made in terms of her red-carpet looks—she’s never had a mistake. You can’t say that about most celebrities, if you look at the longevity of their career! Sophie De Rakoff: When we first meet Bradley, she’s a regional field reporter in West Virginia. They dress themselves, they don’t have a budget; she would’ve been shopping at Macy’s and Kohl’s. In season three, she is [a national] evening news anchor, and it’s the position she’s always dreamed of. She’s moved into a very different arena emotionally and professionally. I would say her anchor look is split, intentionally, to reflect Bradley’s duality. One of the reasons she is successful is she is purple—she can talk to the left and to the right. She’s split between traditional and elevated pantsuits. A wide pant and a fitted jacket is something she’ll alternate with a shorter skirt. Her costumes speak to the duality of masculine and feminine, the left and the right, what’s expected and what isn’t. She crosses back and forth on that fence. It’s intentional. SDR: We collaborated with Lafayette 148 for some custom-made suits. I couldn’t find what I wanted in the right palette, knowing we were moving her into this wider-leg, higher-waisted silhouette. They worked out really well. We also used a lot of McQueen on her for anchor wear. It hit all the right boxes of elevation, name recognition, and a sharp silhouette. In terms of her off-duty wear, it’s always been jeans, boots, T-shirts, leather jackets. But this season we put her in these Frame leather jeans with pumps, and that was a nice twist—another sign of her elevation. She’s stepping into her confidence and much more secure about her own identity. SDR: A lot of times, designers will click with a director and that collaboration keeps on. At this point, my core collaboration has been Reese, and we have a complete shorthand. We’ve been friends for 20 years, so there’s this warm familiarity that makes everything come back to this idea of family. DM: I think something that most people don’t know is that designers don’t have the opportunity to work with other designers, for the most part. If we know them, we know them socially. This was a unique situation. SDR: It’s very unusual to work like this, but Debra and I are happy to talk about it, so we can be an example for other designers that it can take a village and be done collaboratively. It’s a big show, and there are a lot of characters. It’s a lot of designing. But the big difference between features and episodic is, it’s very different time management—very often we don’t have all the scripts at the beginning of a season, so you’re constantly making decisions quickly, pivoting, designing, and executing very quickly … but [the third costume designer] and I share an office, and Debra is right next door, so. We are in constant communication. It’s very enjoyable. DM: We don’t have that situation. We actually steal more from Jen’s closet than Jen would steal from us! We do fittings at her home, and every so often I’ll put her in a Saint Laurent pant and she’ll say, “I have one from three seasons ago that will work better.” And often it does. There are several pants this season, and maybe some jewelry, that’s personally hers. We love to open her jewelry drawers! This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

,,The Morning Show Season 3 Is Must-See TV After Two Year Hiatus,"Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are back in the newsroom with some new guests joining them. THE BEST PART of waking up (at least, in this alternate TV show reality) is cancel culture diatribes and failing news networks on Apple TV+'s The Morning Show. After a two-year hiatus and a second season defined by COVID, one of Apple's earliest flagship shows returns with a third season looking to cut through the noise of a crowded fall TV market with good old-fashioned newsroom drama. Season 2 ended the way the Covid-19 pandemic started in March 2020: shrouded in uncertainty and panic. UBA's The Morning Show host Alexandra ""Alex"" Levy (Jennifer Aniston) closed a broadcast imploring the viewing public to “stay safe and stay sane"" as Covid-19 begins blanketing the country. She also struggled with Covid-19 symptoms throughout the entire finale. Covid was only her latest battle, as Alex became the most hated person on TV after footage leaked of her speaking positively about her disgraced former on-air co-host Mitch Kessler (Steve Carrell) at his memorial, and also admitting to visiting him in Italy, a potential Covid hot zone. Mitch was fired and canceled in Season 1 for sexually assaulting UBA talent booker Hannah Shoenfeld (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). She’s entering Season 3 as a woman who no longer apologizes for who she is or the mistakes she's made. But she isn’t the only one no longer running from shame. Her protective co-host Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) eschews her shame over her missing brother Hal Jackson (Joe Tippett), who is struggling with alcohol addiction, by publicly asking people to help her find him. Season 2 was a reckoning for Bradley, who began accepting her past actions, such as revealing her teenage abortion on air and Hal absolving her of guilt over causing his alcoholism. After reconciling with her brother, Bradley is ready to enter a new era at UBA and The Morning Show with new issues and characters on the horizon. The Morning Show world has some new guests. Jon Hamm plays UBA executive Paul Marks, who the trailer conveniently shows as UBA's President of the News Division Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) says they need someone with ""more money than God."" Ellison, whose launch event of the UBA+ streaming service was curtailed by Covid in Season 2, stresses in the trailer the network is ""flirting with financial disaster. That may be why Marks seemingly offers him a lifeline, meaning Hamm will play a crucial role in the future of The Morning Show. There will also be a new news anchor—Christina Hunter (Nicole Beharie)—who is strutting around in the trailer like she already owns the place. There are enough new faces and problems for The Morning Show to justify the two-year hiatus. But now it's back. Episodes of The Morning Show air on Apple TV+ every Wednesday at 12:01 A.M. Et/9:01 P.M. ET. The next episode will be released on November 8. This season of The Morning Show will have its typical 10-episode slate. That means there is one episode left in The Morning Show Season 3.

,,The 46 Best Shows and Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now (February 2024),"   Take flight with Masters of the Air It's a great time to be a history buff with an Apple TV+ subscription. The streamer's new series Masters of the Air, a World War II drama about fighter pilots, is a thrill — exactly what you'd expect from producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Meanwhile, balancing out all that wartime glory, Martin Scorsese's Oscar nominated film Killers of the Flower Moon digs into a shameful chapter in American history. And stay tuned for Ridley Scott's Napoleon, expected to hit Apple TV+ soon. This list was last updated Feb. 2; newer additions are at the top. For fans of: Band of Brothers, the internet's favorite boys
Number of seasons: 1 You thought Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks were done making limited series about World War II? Think again. The duo behind Band of Brothers and The Pacific are now bringing us Masters of the Air, which follows a group of airmen, nicknamed the ""Bloody Hundredth,"" who conducted risky bomb raids over Germany during the war. The series doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's a thrilling spectacle, and the sprawling cast is a real who's who of It boys, including Austin Butler, Barry Keoghan, and Ncuti Gatwa. -Allison Picurro [Trailer] [Review] For fans of: Historical dramas, true stories, Scorcese flicks, prestige films Martin Scorsese has made a lot of excellent films over the course of his lengthy career, but Killers of the Flower Moon might legitimately be his best work. This three-hour epic, about a sleazy businessman and his similarly sleazy nephew (played by Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, respectively) marrying into a wealthy Osage Nation family and then murdering them to try to steal their money, is another heartbreaking character study from one of the masters. Star Lily Gladstone made history as the first Native American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and the fourth Indigenous actress to be nominated in that category. She's the beating heart of this story. -Phil Owen [Trailer]   For fans of: crime dramas, British TV, socially aware storytelling
Number of seasons: 1 The eight-episode limited series Criminal Record stars Peter Capaldi and Cush Jumbo as a pair of London police detectives who find themselves at odds over an old murder case that seemingly had a lot more going on than Capaldi's character wants everyone to know. The series promises a tightly wound mystery with plenty of twists to sort through and deep character studies. -Phil Owen [Trailer]   For fans of: Spy dramas, incredibly British things, Gary Oldman rippin' toots
Number of seasons: 3 (Renewed through Season 5) Good spy dramas are hard to come by, which makes Slow Horses a refreshing watch in these times of true crime and tech CEOs behaving badly. The series follows a group of MI5 agents who have been relegated to a backwater outpost called Slough House because of past mistakes, where they're supposed to disappear and do grunt work while superstar agents get the glory. Gary Oldman plays the team leader, a disgruntled man who can no longer give an F about anything, while Jack Lowden plays the new member of Slough House who isn't willing to fade away. It's darkly funny and thrilling. In early 2024, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a fifth season before the fourth season even aired. -Tim Surette [Trailer]   More recommendations: For fans of: Putting boots on the moon (and Mars), space travel, alternate history
Number of seasons: 4 What started out as a fun sci-fi drama set in an alternate history in which Russia landed on the the moon before America — locking the two superpowers in an extended space race that lasts for decades — has become one of TV's best shows. Battlestar Galactica's Ronald D. Moore mixes politics, technology, and character drama to create a show that's unlike anything else on TV. After settling on the moon in Season 2 with lunar stations, Season 3 has bigger aspirations of making it to Mars, bringing some of the most breathtaking action sequences the show has ever done while rivals, plus a new private tech firm, attempt to make history. And in Season 4, we're establishing bases on the Red Planet and dealing with labor practices... in space! It's great for space geeks and anyone into speculative fiction. Joel Kinnaman, Wrenn Schmidt, and Krys Marshall star. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Kaiju, the Russell family
Number of seasons: 1 Apple TV+'s biggest star is approximately, as the song goes, 30 stories high. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters brings the cinematic MonsterVerse to the small screen, continuing the story from the 2014 film Godzilla and tracking the origin of the secret cabal Monarch, which hunts and studies MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms, aka monsters). Kurt Russell plays a man linked to Monarch in the current timeline, while his son Wyatt Russell plays the younger version of him in a flashback timeline. It's a summer blockbuster on your TV, for better or worse. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Bridgerton but younger vibes, stickin' it to snobby Brits Need to unstuff a stuffy British period piece? Just add Americans. This adaptation of Edith Wharton's unfinished novel, published in 1938, will no doubt draw appropriate comparisons to Netflix's wildly popular Bridgerton, but the story of five young, new-money American women who head to London in the 1870s to catch British aristocrats for marriage adds a different enough wrinkle to make it stand out. These girls are rowdy and raucous, making the conservative Brits spit out their tea (metaphorically, sadly) at their brash behavior. But behind the culture clashes is a whopper of a love triangle as Nan (future leading lady Kristine Frøseth) finds herself caught between two best friends. A finale that holds its secrets tight until the last minute, sets and costumes that used every farthing of Apple's generous budget, and a youthful energy make this show a fun watch. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The magic of science, Brie Larson speaking like Sheldon Cooper
Number of seasons: 1 Apple TV+'s adaptation of Bonnie Garmus' best-selling book isn't always able to replicate the full flavors of the source material, but the story of a chemist (Brie Larson) who becomes a cooking TV show host after the misogyny of academia ousts her from her first love creates a hero who is still easy to root for. With shifting perspectives and timeline jumps, it can sometimes bite off more than it can chew, but that same structure also creates some of its most touching and emotional moments. Who knew a dog had so much to say? -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Jon le Carré novels, Errol Morris documentaries Documentary filmmaker Errol Morris is well-known for probing his subjects through interrogation, and he may have met his match with John le Carré (real name David Cornwell), the former MI6 operative and British author known as a master of the espionage thriller, with titles such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Night Agent, and The Constant Gardener in his oeuvre. Morris mixes interviews with dramatic reenactments to crack Cornwell's shell in the author's most revealing talk and final interview before his death in 2020. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The late 1980s, magazines, ""Freedom! '90""
Number of seasons: 1 The easy sell is ""here's four hours with some of the most beautiful women to ever walk the Earth,"" but Apple's four-episode docuseries The Super Models is more than skin deep, looking back on the birth of the super model with the women who created it: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington. The first two episodes filled with never-before-seen footage that charts their rise to fame are the best, and the candid interviews give great insight into the behind-the-scenes world of fashion as it was blowing up into the mainstream. Just don't expect anything too deep. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The Newsroom, #MeToo, A-listers
Number of seasons: 3 When Apple TV+ launched, it seemed to do so on the back of The Morning Show, its big-budget, high-profile, star-studded drama that was going to win every award out there. Jennifer Aniston AND Reese Witherspoon starring in the same show as rival anchors for a popular morning show? Well, reviews were mixed, and early episodes were less than impressive, but the show righted many of its wrongs as its season continued and spent another season tinkering with its formula. Now in its third season, the series is at its best, which is to say it's embraced the silliness and is going for it with some big swings about topical subjects. Case in point: A billionaire tries to shoot Aniston's character into space in the Season 3 premiere. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Brothers Grimm fairy tales, mysteries, New York City
Number of seasons: 1 The Changeling follows Apollo Kagwa (LaKeith Stanfield), a rare book dealer whose life takes a turn for the supernatural after his wife (Clark Backo) commits an unthinkable act of violence and then promptly disappears. Determined to figure out the truth of what happened to her, Apollo is led on a journey through a version of New York City that he never knew existed. Based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Victor LaVelle, The Changeling is an enchanting, spooky, slow-burning fairy tale. -Allison Picurro [Trailer] For fans of: Jazzercise, internal dialogue filled with nasty insults
Number of seasons: 3 If you miss Netflix's GLOW, you might find some solace in this 1980s-set dramedy that follows a housewife (Rose Byrne) who finds strength in the aerobics craze that's just starting to sweep across the nation's malls. But don't expect the cheery underdog story from GLOW; Byrne's character is struggling with bulimia and spends much of her days hurling nasty body-shaming insults at other women. Byrne excels in the role as an antihero breaking free from the expectations of a traditional housewife in her own morally questionable way. Season 3 is the final season. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Hard science-fiction, great special effects
Number of seasons: 2 One of Apple TV+'s biggest gambles is the big-budget science-fiction series Foundation, based on the popular books by Isaac Asimov. I enjoyed Season 1 more than most — though, to be fair, I wasn't familiar with the source material, so I couldn't do any comparisons — but the biggest complaint was that it was uneven and had difficulty bringing Asimov's colossal ideas to television. But the performances are great, particularly from an inspired Lee Pace as the royal villain Brother Day and the always reliable Jared Harris as Hari Seldon. The ambitious premise is too big to explain in a single blurb — basically, some exiles are trying to rebuild society after the collapse of a long-ruling empire — but it's worth checking out if you're a fan of hard sci-fi. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Murder mysteries, your favorite comedians, genre switching
Number of seasons: 2 This comedic murder mystery anthology series combines the plot mechanics of Knives Out with the sense of humor of an Upright Citizens Brigade sketch. The first season — with an all-star cast that includes Ben Schwartz, Sam Richardson, Ilana Glazer, John Early, Tiffany Haddish, Ike Barinholtz, and Jamie Demetriou — focuses on the murder of a pop star at his high school reunion's afterparty. The second season — which brings back Haddish, Richardson, and Zoë Chao and adds the likes of John Cho, Jack Whitehall, and Poppy Liu — tackles a whole new case involving a wedding that's thrown into disarray when the groom is murdered. It's a genre-hopping good time. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]  For fans of: 24 but in the sky and only for 7 hours
Number of seasons: 1 This perfectly fine seven-episode thriller stars Idris Elba as a man on board a flight that gets hijacked by terrorists. The good thing about Elba's character? He's a fantastic business negotiator, which makes him the perfect hero to negotiate with the terrorists. Each episode represents an hour of the ordeal, so there is a good sense of a ticking clock going on. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Chaotic best friends
Number of seasons: 1 Despite what When Harry Met Sally taught us, in Platonic, straight men and women can just be friends. This endearingly silly comedy, created by Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, reunites Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen as a pair of old friends who reconnect after years apart, which leads to chaos — and some constructive change — as they both reconsider what they want their lives to look like. It's a fun hangout comedy with a dash of midlife crisis. As Keith Phipps says in his review, ""Beneath gags about late-night cell phone etiquette, nightmarish home renovation projects, and raccoons is a bittersweet exploration of giving up youthfulness for middle age, what's lost and gained in the exchange, and the realization that your true friends are the ones still with you on the other side."" -Kelly Connolly [Trailer] For fans of: Michael J. Fox! Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth) directs this documentary on 1980s Hollywood legend Michael J. Fox, whose career was paused by a Parkinson's diagnosis. The film works because it embodies the optimistic spirit of Fox, whose wit and charm push Still into an uplifting tale of persevering rather than a sad story of what could have been. Guggenheim's use of classic Fox clips to push the narrative forward will only remind you of just how great Fox was and is. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Sci-fi murder mysteries, deep holes in the ground
Number of seasons: 1 This new sci-fi series — an adaptation of Hugh Howey's 2012 book Wool — from Justified's Graham Yost starts off with a rough first episode, but the story — a near-future dystopian murder mystery set in an underground facility where the last surviving thousands of humans live — really gets chugging in Episode 2. That's when we're introduced to Rebecca Ferguson's Juliette, an engineer discovering that a series of murders just might be related to the rule-makers of their subterranean abode. Fair warning: This moody and drab drama is for hard sci-fi lovers or fans of Scandinavian noir. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Musical comedies, corn pudding
Number of seasons: 2 Despite being perfectly enjoyable, musical comedy series don't have the most successful track record (Galavant, where art thou?). But Apple TV+'s genre-busting series Schmigadoon! is bucking the trend in a good way. Keegan-Michael Key and Cecily Strong star as a couple who come across a magical town where everyone seems stuck in a 1940s musical. They get stuck in the town, which makes it a bit of a Twilight Zone episode or horror movie where everyone sings about corn pudding. Also, Martin Short plays a leprechaun. This show is goofy on the outside, but secretly twisted. In the fantastic Season 2, the series shifts to ""Schmicago"" to lampoon musicals from the '60s and '70s. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Small town comedies, existential questions, comically large bowls of spaghetti
Number of seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) Chris O'Dowd stars in this comfortably whimsical comedy about citizens of a small town who get in a tizzy when a mysterious machine called The Morpho arrives with a promise to reveal their life potential on a little blue card. Seeing how these regular folk take to archery, motorcycle riding, and other hobbies they previously had no interest in is both hilarious and thought-provoking, as questions of prophecy, latent desires, and divine intervention swirl around your head. But the real draw here is the charming cast and the characters they bring to life with intertwining stories sharpened with a bit of mystery. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Making fun of Americans, making fun of the British, sports, feeling good
Number of seasons: 3 If any show can be credited with restoring faith in humanity after the whirlwind of 2020, it is Ted Lasso. The titular Ted (Jason Sudeikis) is an American college football coach who heads to England to coach an actual football (soccer, for the uninitiated) team. While the setup seems like a farce -- Ted's hiring is part of an elaborate scheme by an embittered woman looking to ruin the beloved football team of her cheating ex-husband -- Ted's seemingly unshakeable good nature and determination to see the best in everyone, even those actively trying to do him harm, is downright inspiring. He doesn't just bring a glow to everyone around him; he leaves viewers with hope that things can get better and that doing your best is enough. He's the hero we didn't know we needed. Season 3 might be the last season of the show, or it might not. Sudeikis and Apple are being extremely non-committal, probably because Apple is holding up a check with a lot of numbers on it to keep it going despite the producers' insistence that the originally planned three-season arc is finished. -Megan Vick [Trailer]  For fans of: Complaining, watching someone being forced to do something they don't want to
Number of seasons: 1 If you find travel shows too packed with things like ""wonder"" and ""enthusiasm"" from their eager hosts, then take a tour of the world with Schitt's Creek's Eugene Levy. As the title implies, Levy would rather loaf around in the comforts of his temperature-controlled home, but here he's visiting beautiful spots like Finland, the Maldives, and Venice, complaining about the weather the entire time. But that's the attraction of the show; Levy's whining is actually more of a draw then the spots he's in, making this less of a travel show and more of a one-man play. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Ted Lasso, crossing boundaries, sad sacks
Number of seasons: 1 Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein and Bill Lawrence team up with Jason Segel for this tragi-com about a therapist (Segel) swirling the toilet bowl of life after his wife dies. So what he decides to do is tell it to his patients like it is, obliterating the professional boundaries of therapists. But because this is a TV show from the same team that said a football coach could go to England and coach a soccer team, the advice works! Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams also star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Psychological horror from M. Night Shyamalan, babies, food
Number of seasons: 4 The claustrophobic thriller Servant, created by Tony Basgallop and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan, began as a wild-eyed but mechanically precise story about a family unraveling in the wake of a tragedy. In Season 1, Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and Sean Turner (Toby Kebbell) hired live-in nanny Leanne (Nell Tiger Free) to care for the lifelike ""reborn doll"" that a grieving Dorothy believed was her son — only for the doll to somehow become a living baby. Now, the show has gone full-on supernatural as Leanne's true nature has come out. It's the details that make this show stand out, like the rich wallpaper of the Turners' Philadelphia brownstone, the wet, wet, shoes of Leanne's weird uncle (Boris McGiver), and the most unsettling food design since Hannibal. The fourth and final season is now airing. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]  For fans of: The immigrant experience, anthologies, crying your eyes out in a good way
Number of seasons: 2 If you need a nice pick-me-up from the ills of the world, this anthology series from Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Master of None's Alan Yang is a good bet. Each episode of Little America is based on the true stories of immigrants in America, showing off their successes and experiences in humorous and heartwarming fashion, like the Indian spelling bee whiz who ran his parents' hotel after they were deported and petitioned Laura Bush to help him get them back. The best part of the show is that it focuses on the systemic challenges they face rather than on hate from racist individuals, and the stories vary wildly so they don't feel repetitive. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Action and artsiness at the same time, guns but emotion
Number of seasons: 1 Imagine if Strike Back, the great Cinemax action series, took some time to appreciate the beauty of life and nature in between blowing things up. That's kind of like what Echo 3 is. The series hails from Mark Boal, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker, and follows a scientist (Jessica Ann Collins) who gets captured by South American rebels and the ensuing mission to get her back by her husband (Michiel Huisman) and brother (Luke Evans), who both happen to be Special Forces. I'm not sure the intense, no-frills action sequences, the meaning-of-life pondering shots of nature, and the emotional flashback snippets belong in the same show together, but for those looking for an elevated military drama, this is it, even if it doesn't always work. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Workplace comedies, the video game industry
Number of seasons: 3 (+special episodes) It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenney is smart enough to know that video games are funny, but they're not to be made fun of. Gamers are legion, after all. The game biz gets a loving sendup in Mythic Quest without making gamers the joke, as McElhenney plays the egotistical creative director of a popular MMORPG that's seemingly always in trouble in some way or another. F. Murray Abraham leaves the show in Season 3 (in spectacular fashion, I might add), but the excellent cast still includes Danny Pudi, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, David Hornsby, Imani Hakim, and Charlotte Nicdao, who's one of TV's most underrated talents. Even with a third season that doesn't hit like the previous two, this is one of TV's best workplace comedies. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Selena Gomez, getting to know a down-to-earth megastar You can watch Selena Gomez in streaming originals on Netflix (The Fundamentals of Caring), Hulu (Only Murders in the Building), or HBO Max (Selena + Chef), but now you can really see who Selena Gomez is on Apple TV+. This documentary follows Selena as she struggles with stardom, accepts her diagnoses of lupus, bipolar disorder, and depression, and turns her focus on helping herself and others. It's a must-see for Selena fans, and an ought-to-see for everyone else looking for a cathartic film about one's truth. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Hard work, sunny vibes, telenovelas
Number of seasons: 2 (Renewed for Season 3) If you need to wash the day away, you can't do much better than checking into the Las Colinas resort in Acapulco, the setting for this comedy about a young man who gets a dream job working at a high-end resort in Mexico. The 1980s-set bilingual comedy -- it's about 50/50 English and Spanish -- is like Jane the Virgin meets The White Lotus meets How I Met Your Mother, as Maximo (Enrique Arrizon) works his way up from pool boy in 1984 to wealthy hotelier in the present-day timeline. It's charming, it's sunny, and it's got a pair of lounge singers who belt out '80s classics in Spanish. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Big Little Lies, Irish accents, cinematography
Number of Seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) The great Sharon Horgan (Catastrophe) created and stars in this Irish series that's something like Big Little Lies as a dark comedy. It's about five sisters — played by Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene, and Eve Hewson — one of whom is married to a truly awful man played by Claes Bang, who, when the show begins, is dead. The show unfolds over two timelines, and there's a mystery in each one: What happened to him and how exactly the sisters were involved in his death in the past, and whether they'll be able to keep the secret in the present. It's thrillingly biting in Horgan's signature way. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]        For fans of: Mindhunter, prison stories
Number of Seasons: 1 Black Bird is one of this year's rarest birds: a true crime adaptation that actually feels fresh — and horrifying. Developed by novelist Dennis Lehane and based on James Keene's autobiographical novel In With the Devil, the drama series stars Taron Egerton as Keene, who's facing a 10-year prison sentence before he gets an unexpected offer: He'll be freed if he can befriend and tease a confession out of a suspected serial killer (Paul Walter Hauser). Ray Liotta, in one of his final roles, plays Jimmy's father, an ex-cop with his own burdens. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]        For fans of: Dancing at bat and bar mitzvahs, crowd-pleasing tearjerkers Cooper Raiff is having his Hollywood moment. The young writer, director, and star of Cha Cha Real Smooth saw his film take home the Sundance Audience Prize earlier this year, leading Apple to gobble it up (Apple did the same with CODA, which went on to win Best Picture). Raiff plays 22-year-old Andrew, whose charm earns him a job as a party starter at bat and bar mitzvahs, which leads him to fall for an engaged mother (Dakota Johnson) of an autistic child. Post-college confusion ensues as Andrew struggles to find his place in the world, making CCRS a coming-of-age story with laughs and tears. It won't win Best Picture, but it's one of the easiest movies to watch this year. -Tim Surette [Trailer]     For fans of: Thunder lizards, better than average CGI, David Attenborough
Number of seasons: 1 The whole ""it's a regular nature show, but with dinosaurs"" thing has been attempted many times ever since we first caught a glimpse of a brachiosaurus in the original Jurassic Park. The results have been mixed, with most failing to deliver good-looking dinos, but technology is finally at a place where computers can whip up herds of dinosaurs that require a second glance to check if they're real or not. And that realism is important for the emotional impact; ever see a baby pterosaur in a life-or-death race with a predator? With Father Nature David Attenborough narrating and five episodes divided up by biomes, it's the closest we've come to Planet Earth for dinosaurs. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Mythological creatures, star-crossed romance, picturesque English countrysides
Number of seasons: 1 Apple TV+'s adaptation of Sarah Perry's 2016 novel, in which a sea serpent — or at least the possibility of one — terrorizes Essex, England in Victorian times, is the rare period romance and folk horror combo packed with star power. Claire Danes plays the naturalist hunting down the monster, while Tom Hiddleston plays the reverend who's sort of like the Scully to Danes' Mulder. What starts as a monster hunt quickly becomes a witch hunt as the townspeople turn on Danes' character. Lots of juicy metaphors here! The six-episode season is more of a simmer than a boil, but it's gorgeously shot and the performances are excellent. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Homeland, thrillers, stress, espionage
Number of seasons: 2 Aside from Amazon's Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan and whatever passes for a thriller on NBC these days, American television has mostly backed away from international espionage dramas that were once such a hot ticket. To get your spy thrills, you need to look elsewhere, like the Israeli spy thriller Tehran. The International Emmy winner for Best Drama last year, Tehran follows Tamar Rabinyan (Niv Sultan), a female Mossad agent navigating a world of espionage, double crosses, and her cultural quandary as she was born in Iran. After attempting to shut down Iran's plans for atomic weapons in Season 1, Glenn Close joined the cast in Season 2 as a British agent. -Tim Surette [Trailer]          For fans of: Brooding murder mysteries, sci-fi twists, early '90s Chicago indie rock
Number of seasons: 1 Somewhere underneath Elisabeth Moss's innocent exterior is a goth girl with a love for the morbid. Following dark roles in The Handmaid's Tale, Top of the Lake, and The Invisible Man, things don't get any cheerier in Shining Girls, in which she plays a woman working at the Chicago Sun-Times who is hunting down a serial killer (Jamie Bell) who previously assaulted her during a murder attempt. The twist here is that she finds herself slipping through different realities — multiverse? wormhole? an extreme practical joke? — with the only real constant being the killer and the case. Wagner Moura plays the reporter helping her, and Chris Chalk plays a Times photographer who is also someone a lot closer to her, at least in one reality. Moss is her usual excellent self, Bell is certifiably creepy, and it checks all the boxes for being a competent murder mystery. Plus, Leonardo DiCaprio produced it! -Tim Surette [Trailer]          For fans of: The weekend, r/antiwork, brain-melting thrillers
Number of seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) The whole idea of work-life balance gets revisited with a technological twist in this sci-thriller that will make you want to quit your day job. Mark (Adam Scott) works at Lumon Industries, where a new procedure implants a chip into employees' brains that severs their consciousness into their work life and personal life, splitting their life in two so that neither knows what the other does. Obviously, Lumon is up to no good, and as the employees get closer to the truth, the line between their work lives and personal lives blurs. Scott is joined by a tremendous cast that includes Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, and Christopher Walken, and Ben Stiller and Aoife McArdle work magic behind the camera with one of the best-looking shows in a while. It is WEIRD, yet weaves a complicated conspiracy that will have you hooked. -Tim Surette [Trailer]  For fans of: Willy Shakespeare, a Coen brother, Denzel Washington Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand star in this adaptation of Shakespeare's Scottish play. It's the first solo film from a Coen brother — McDormand's husband Joel directs, adapts, and produces along with her. If you love art movies, there's not much else that needs to be said to get you to watch this. I mean, it's Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as Lord and Lady Macbeth. It's kind of historic, in all its black-and-white, Expressionist glory. It was nominated for three Oscars and didn't win any, which only bolsters its artistic credibility. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]  For fans of: Art films, innovation, rock band turbulence Film auteur Todd Haynes directed this documentary on one of America's most groundbreaking rock bands, The Velvet Underground. But rather than the simple talking heads, live footage, repeat structure used in most rock docs, Haynes gets to the essence of the band by making the film an arthouse gem that Lou Reed and company would have loved. Don't worry, it's still loaded with VU tunes and insight into the tumultuous relationship between Reed and his bandmates, it just looks extra trippy while doing so. Put simply, this is one of the best music documentaries ever made. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Heartwarming movies, Deaf culture A remake of the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, CODA (which stands for Child of Deaf Adults) is a coming-of-age story about a 17-year-old girl (Emilia Jones) who is the only hearing member of her Deaf family, and must choose between pursuing her own dreams of becoming a singer or helping her mother and father with the family business. It's a crowd-pleasing tearjerker, with a wonderful performance from Jones. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first movie released by a streaming service to do so. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Psychological and erotic thrillers, getting mindf---ed, delicious subtext
Number of seasons: 1 One of the most intriguing releases of 2021, the Israeli psychological drama is lathered up in erotically charged mystery that takes cues from the greats of the film world. Writer-director Sigal Avin leans on Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and more for influences in her story about an aging female director (Ayelet Zurer) who becomes obsessed with a young, seductive screenwriter (Lihi Kornowski) and the film that might save her career but destroy her marriage. It's wonderfully shot and loaded with beautiful people, if that's your thing. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Politics, Lord of the Flies, the future of America, chaos Boys State was one of the best documentaries of 2020. The film follows the annual Boys State, a summer camp (this particular one's in Texas) sponsored by the American Legion in which more than 1,000 high school boys come together to form their own two-party government, complete with elections, voting, and mudslinging. It's a remarkable look at the pitfalls of our current political system, hyper-masculinity among teen boys, and the future of America (it looks like we're in both good and bad hands). Beyond the fascinating subject matter, the filmmaking is superb and gorgeous, feeling more like a scripted movie than a guerilla-shot documentary, which is a compliment in this case. If you like Lord of the Flies or Kid Nation (which, how can you not?), you're going to love this. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Period pieces with anachronisms, Wiz Khalifa
Number of seasons: 3 Every early headline about Dickinson, an Apple TV+ show about Emily Dickinson, felt like a fever dream: John Mulaney guest starring as Henry David Thoreau! Wiz Khalifa playing Death! The show, which stars Hailee Steinfeld as the great American poet in her younger years, is the sort of beautiful gamble that could either soar or fall on its face, with almost no room for anything in between. It worked out — Dickinson totally rules. A delirious, anachronistic period piece, it's both a very funny show and a surreal elegy for all the great art lost to misogyny. It's as bold and haunting as the work of its heroine. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]  For fans of: The LGBTQ+ community, the progressive movement, television history Apple TV+'s expansive and carefully paced history of LGBTQ+ people on TV deserves kudos for its thoughtful, authoritative, and exhausting summation. Even if it weren't packed with the most well-known queer people on TV, Visible: Out on Television does an excellent job of tracking how gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and non-binary people have been depicted on television from its earliest days — including the frantic, hyper-paranoid news reports of the 1950s declaring queer people a menacing threat. It's practically a college course, methodically chronicling representation throughout the decades through archival footage, news reports, and the like, but its abundant first-person testimonials from practically every living LGBTQ+ TV star you can think of (plus allies like Oprah, Billy Crystal and more) make Visible: Out on Television an invaluable educational tool for everyone who watches. -Malcolm Venable [Trailer]  For fans of: The wonderful Cartoon Saloon films, wolves, Irish mythology (and accents) The beautifully animated film Wolfwalkers came out in theaters in 2020, but there's about a 99% chance you didn't see it because of, well, obvious reasons. It's the third in a series of films based on Irish folklore from the studio Cartoon Saloon, following the critically acclaimed The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea (highly recommended), and tells the story of a young girl who heads to Ireland from England with her dad to kill off the last wolf pack but ends up befriending a young girl who is part of a tribe of humans who become wolves at night. It's less Disney and Pixar and more Hayao Miyazaki, and it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Pop some corn and gather the family for movie night. -Tim Surette [Trailer] ",www.tvguide.com,https://www.tvguide.com/news/best-apple-tv-shows-movies/,

,,Jennifer Aniston says the ‘world needs humor’ as younger set find ‘Friends’ offensive,"Jennifer Aniston says “Friends” has become foe to a younger generation’s sensibilities. Aniston has been playing comedic roles since she stepped into Rachel Greene’s shoes on the 1994 mega-hit “Friends.” She quickly became a superstar, and in the decades since has been serving up the laughs in movies like the 2004 romantic comedy “Along Came Polly” and the 2013 romp “We’re the Millers,” in which she slayed as a stripper moonlighting as a soccer mom. Aniston, ahead of the release of her latest Netflix movie, “Murder Mystery 2,” spoke with AFP (via Yahoo News) about the evolution of comedy. MOVIES  March 22, 2023 “Now it’s a little tricky because you have to be very careful, which makes it really hard for comedians, because the beauty of comedy is that we make fun of ourselves, make fun of life,” Aniston said. “[In the past] you could joke about a bigot and have a laugh — that was hysterical. And it was about educating people on how ridiculous people were. And now we’re not allowed to do that.” “There’s a whole generation of people, kids, who are now going back to episodes of ‘Friends’ and find them offensive,” Aniston added. “There were things that were never intentional and others … well, we should have thought it through — but I don’t think there was a sensitivity like there is now.” “Friends” has been catching flack for years about its lack of diversity and the offensive nature of some of its jokes. TELEVISION  June 29, 2022 A once-obese Monica Geller (played by Courteney Cox) is the butt of body-shaming jokes throughout the series, and her brother Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) faces a barrage of homophobic punchlines because his ex-wife left him for a woman. Bustle published a list of offensive “Friends” jokes in 2018; Cosmopolitan published a list of “shocking” jokes in 2017 that “Friends” couldn’t “get away with today.” Series creator Marta Kauffman told the BBC in 2022 that she now regrets the representation of the character played by Kathleen Turner. “We kept referring to her as Chandler’s father, even though Chandler’s father was trans,” she said. “Pronouns were not yet something that I understood. So we didn’t refer to that character as she. That was a mistake.” ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS  Nov. 9, 2022 Kauffman also addressed the show’s lack of diversity. “I’ve learned a lot in the last 20 years,” Kauffman told The Times’ Greg Braxton in 2022. “Admitting and accepting guilt is not easy. It’s painful looking at yourself in the mirror. I’m embarrassed that I didn’t know better 25 years ago. “It was after what happened to George Floyd that I began to wrestle with my having bought into systemic racism in ways I was never aware of.

I’m not sure what else, but, to me, it should be looked at as a time capsule, not for what they did wrong,” she said. “Also, this show thought it was very progressive. There was a guy whose wife discovered she was gay and pregnant, and they raised the child together? We had surrogacy too. It was, at the time, progressive.” Especially in the United States, where everyone is “far too divided,” we can’t “take ourselves too seriously,” Aniston told AFP. “Everybody needs funny!” she added. “The world needs humor!” Jan. 30, 2024 Jan. 16, 2024 Dec. 22, 2023 It's a date Get our L.A.

,,How The Morning Show Pulls From Real-Life Scandal,"The Morning Show, Apple’s marquee series on its new streaming service Apple TV+, is not a ripped-from-the-headlines true story à la The Crown or certain episodes of Law and Order: SVU. But the drama starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell is based, loosely, on NBC’s Today Show. And from the opening minutes of the first episode, it’s clear that the premiere draws inspiration from the #MeToo scandal that embroiled that network beginning in 2017. Trying to sort out how much of the show is fact and how much is fiction, however, gets a little complicated. The Morning Show is at least partially inspired by journalist Brian Stelter’s book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV, which chronicles the behind-the-scenes competition between NBC’s Today, ABC’s Good Morning America and CBS’ This Morning, circa 2012. (Stelter is a consulting producer on the show.) Those who regularly tuned into morning TV back in 2012 will remember the moment when NBC determined that Today co-hosts Matt Lauer and Ann Curry did not have chemistry and unceremoniously pushed Curry off the show. She cried. America got mad — at Lauer, at her, at the network — and many viewers changed the channel to Good Morning America. The upshot: Audiences liked to wake up to two people they thought of as America’s parents — often one man and one woman in those days. The shows were at least as much, if not more, about the chemistry between the hosts than delivering news. NBC faced public scrutiny again in 2017 when Lauer was accused of sexual misconduct and fired from the network. Over the years, more details have begun to trickle out about Lauer’s alleged abuses. He reportedly had a button on his desk to remotely close his door, and one NBC employee said he used that button to corner her in his office. A report from NBCUniversal said the button is “a commonly available feature in executive offices in multiple NBCUniversal facilities to provide an efficient way to close the door without getting up from the desk.” New Yorker reporter Ronan Farrow’s recently published book Catch and Kill, which details his attempts to break the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse story during his time as a reporter at NBC, contains an interview with a former NBC employee who says that Lauer raped her while they were covering the Olympics. Farrow also accuses the network of forcing Farrow to pause his Weinstein reporting and eventually take it elsewhere, reportedly because they worried Weinstein would expose Lauer’s bad behavior if NBC reported on Weinstein’s history of allegations of assault. Lauer has admitted to — and apologized for — becoming romantically involved with NBC staffers, but denied allegations of harassment and assault. NBC has also denied scuttling Farrow’s story. Lauer is far from the only figure in the TV news world to be felled by #MeToo. Charlie Rose, Tom Brokaw and Mark Halperin were all accused of sexual misconduct in the workplace in the wake of the Weinstein allegations. (Rose apologized, Brokaw denied and Halperin did a little of both.) Top of the Morning didn’t disclose any such revelations. But The Morning Show clearly pulls from those recent events. “The show existed before #MeToo happened,” Aniston said during a press conference. “The show was always going to be pulling a curtain [back] on the New York media world and the morning talk shows. Once #MeToo happened, the conversation drastically changed and we just incorporated it.” The show begins with staffers on a morning show finding out via text (conveniently on their iPhones) that one of the co-anchors, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), is being fired for sexual misconduct. We find out later in the show that he had a button on his desk to remotely close his door. We also see him in conversation with a director also taken down by the #MeToo movement. That director essentially admits during the conversation to sexual assault of a minor and other misdeeds, a story that sounds all too familiar. After the revelations, Mitch’s co-anchor Alex Levy, played by Jennifer Aniston, has to announce the news alone on air. The scene is reminiscent of Savannah Guthrie doing the same thing after Lauer was fired. We can’t know how closely her reaction is mirrored in Alex’s — Aniston’s character is angry that it happened, sad that her friend of many years is leaving her vulnerable on the show and excited that she may have an opportunity to spin this news to promote her own career — but the complicated and messy fallout certainly seems realistic based on the competitive world that Stelter presents in his book. Aniston has said that she based her character on Diane Sawyer. “I’ve known Diane for years, and I had the joy of getting to pick her brain when I was doing research for the show,” the actor told InStyle. In particular, she was inspired by the sexism and ageism that older women on television face. “Alex’s sell-by date expired long ago,” she added, “and she’s trying to stay relevant.” Aniston also shadowed journalists at ABC, where Sawyer once worked. “I was at Good Morning America at 5 a.m. to do some shadow work,” Aniston told Entertainment Weekly. “What a crazy world! From 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. it’s like a ghost town, and then slowly all the lights start turning on and all the sounds start getting louder and louder and louder, and then all of a sudden it’s this mad, insane, well-oiled machine and everyone’s somehow calm.” She learned a few tips from journalists who have to wake up at 3:30 every morning, like pairing Red Bull and coffee. Many aspects of the show are purely fictional. There is no equivalent to Reese Witherspoon’s character — Bradley Jackson, a woman plucked from a smaller TV station after a video of her yelling at a protestor goes viral — on morning television right now. But the problems Bradley faces are very real. “One thing that I thought was really demoralizing was how much they’re analyzed: Their wardrobe, their faces, their smile, their laugh are all tested, and they are put on notice if they are not appealing to an audience,” Witherspoon told EW. “Because test audiences are determining whether or not they’re likable to an American audience. Women who’ve worked so hard to become incredible journalists and to ascend to a position of what seemed like power are relatively powerless.” Both characters suffer under this sexism even as the network they work for tries to reshape the morning show in the wake of accusations of misconduct. Their responses are pulled directly from real-world journalists. It may be that in diverging from the exact beats of any specific #MeToo scandal, The Morning Show gets as close to to the truth as any depiction we’ve seen.

,,"Everything to Know About 'The Morning Show,' Including a Sneak Peek Clip for Season 3","The newsroom drama The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, will be returning this Fall for a third season—but with a few changes, including a new showrunner and added cast. The Morning Show is a workplace drama about the lives of Alex Levy (Aniston) and Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon) who have been navigating the aftermath of sexual misconduct allegations against Alex’s former co-anchor Mitch (Steve Carell) at the morning news show where they are employed. “If #MeToo was the center of Season 1 and Season 2 has so many issues but really tackles the impending pandemic, I would love to see how the world realigns post-quarantine,” Witherspoon told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 about her thoughts on Season 3. ""Even though that seems optimistic to say at this point, with people still dealing with the complexity of COVID and really what it’s doing to different industries. But just, how the whole world has culturally shifted in so many ways; the way we communicate and work, the way we talk to each other—there’s definitely a lot to talk about and tackle.” As we get closer to the Sept. 13 premiere date, we're learning more about the changes coming for Season 3, including the addition of Mad Men star Jon Hamm, Nicole Beharie, Tig Notaro, and the return of Julianna Margulies in her role as Laura Peterson, an anchor at UBA News and Bradley Jackson's love interest. Apple TV revealed the casting the news in a release saying Hamm will appear as Paul Marks, a corporate titan who sets his sights on UBA. On July 27, Apple released the first full trailer for The Morning Show Season 3, and it promises to be an explosive season. Billy Crudup's Cory Ellison says, ""It's time to smash and shatter. Let's burn it all down"" and media titan Jon Hamm's Paul Marks bursts onto the scene and offers a ""lifeline."" The real stars—Witherspoon and Aniston—are a little more reflective. ""We were supposed to change things, weren't we?"" Witherspoon's Bradley Jackson says. ""I wanted to make a difference."" Aniston's Alex Levy says she needs ""to have a say in the future of this place"" before suggesting they let out all the secrets. ""Honestly, let all the secrets come out,"" Aniston says. ""They did not protect me."" Watch the full trailer below. And Aniston shared the following with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show in March 2023 about Season 3: ""Everybody has a secret. We’re revealing a lot of secrets. There’s definitely romance. Mr. Jon Hamm is a big one. We were excited to get him. Isn’t he the nicest guy? He’s this very handsome leading man and then he’s got this funny."" And Reese Witherspoon has shared four behind-the-scene photos of her from the set of The Morning Show Season 3, writing: ""Office hours @morningshow ✨Sneak peek of Season 3.""  Earlier, Reese had posted the following with the caption, ""We are backkkkkkkk! 🎬 ✨ @TheMorningShow Season 3!"" Keep reading to find out everything we know so far about The Morning Show Season 3. The Morning Show Season 3 will return on Wednesday, Sept. 13 The series began production in August 2022 and wrapped on Feb. 11 per Jennifer Aniston and Mark Duplass' Instagrams, but producers still need time for post-production edits so we've got a bit of waiting before the new season arrives. Nope! AppleTV+ renewed the series for Season 4 in late April 2023. According to Deadline, Aniston and Witherspoon's contracts expired at the end of Season 3, but both actresses are in talks and expected to sign new deals, which may include an option for Season 5. AppleTV+ released this new photo of Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston with the news that The Morning Show has been renewed for Season 4. Yes! Although scheduling Season 4 may be a challenge, AppleTV+ has renewed the series for Season 4—before Season 3 has even aired. Witherspoon is lining up other projects, including All Stars, a Ted Lasso-esque cheerleading series for Amazon's Prime Video and reprising her Election character, Tracy Flick, in a Paramount+ sequel. This season, the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom.  In addition, the cast has leaked a little info.  Jennifer Aniston shared her thoughts on Alex's personal life: ""I think it’s time to see Alex find some love and some passion,” Aniston told Variety. “She could put the controls down and go into the vulnerability of opening up her heart, which I don’t think she’s ever really quite done.” She also noted that she'd like to get to know Alex more outside the office. In addition to her love life, she said she'd like to see her hanging with friends, having a girls night, shopping in the supermarket or generally getting ""out of her ivory tower a little bit."" We can definitely get behind that! While Aniston clearly has ideas about her character's development, she remained mum on the overarching theme for Season 3. “I can’t say much. It’s a great opportunity to be able to shine a light on areas that are very frustrating and a fear of where we’re going as a society,” she the mag. “We try to shed some sort of light on it, and comment on it a little bit. It’s a deep well at this point.” While Kerry Ehrin will be a consultant on Season 3, rather than the showrunner, she did tease what might happen on Season 3 before turning over the reins. She told The Hollywood Reporter that there might be a time jump between Seasons 2 and 3, rather than picking up where they ended. ""You could [jump into the future],” she said, not interested in exploring the COVID-19 pandemic, which is where Season 2 ended.  “I think it’s going to have been done, done, done. You could go backwards. It's such an interesting little universe. You really can put it anywhere in time, and I think the challenge of the show is coming up with that big subject.” Ehrin also told Deadline, ""I definitely want to see more of Bradley and Laura. I feel like Alex has come to a place for the first time since the pilot of accepting who she is and facing her worst fears, and I want to see how the phoenix rises from the ashes for her and learning how to have a full life and be present and loving."" Also, Ehrin says we might also see more of Paola Lambruschini (Valerina Golino). Paola was the woman who interviewed Mitch before his death and brought the footage to America. Reese Witherspoon Apple TV+ Jennifer Aniston Related: Jennifer Aniston on How She Gets a Good Night's Sleep Billy Crudup Mark Duplass Nestor Carbonell “I hope I get in a world of trouble, selfishly, because I always have fun being in the middle of a storm,” the actor told TV Insider. Julianna Margulies Karen Pittman Desean Terry Janina Gavankar Greta Lee Related: Holland Taylor's Concern About Education in America Goes Way Beyond Her New Netflix Series The Chair Photo by Cheryl Mann Jon Hamm will appear as Paul Marks, a corporate titan who sets his sights on UBA. His influence will have major effects on Cory, Alex and Bradley in Season 3. In an interview with Deadline, Witherspoon shared more details about Hamm's character, saying, ""It’s such a good part. You’re just going to get the full Hamm. Wait, that didn’t sound right... He is a very complex character. He’s a media mogul and he gives Billy Crudup a run for his money, which I think is the most fun part, too, because Billy could eat a scene like I’ve never seen somebody eat a scene, and Hamm gets to come in and give him a great foil. It’s Alien vs. Predator,"" she jokes. The news comes on the heels of The Morning Show landing multiple Emmy Award nominations and two wins (lead actress and supporting actor) in 2022, as well as Apple TV+ landing an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Commercial for its “Everyone but Jon Hamm” spot. Photo by C Flanigan/FilmMagic Nicole Beharie will star as Christina Hunter, a grounded, competitive and charismatic Millennial who is a new anchor on The Morning Show. Christina works hard, plays hard and navigates the Teacup with good-humored irreverence. Photo by Rodin Eckenroth/FilmMagic According to Deadline, Tig Notaro will play Amanda Robinson, the chief of staff to corporate titan Paul Marks (Hamm). Charlotte Stoudt, who has previously written for Fosse/Verdon and Homeland, will serve as showrunner for Season 3. She will take over from Kerry Ehrin, who developed the show and will serve as a consultant on the new season, as well as continue developing new series for Apple TV under a previously announced overall deal. “I’m excited to be joining forces with Apple TV and The Morning Show,” said Stoudt. ""One of the fun things about The Morning Show is the humor,"" Stoudt told The Hollywood Reporter. ""You can write slightly looser scenes, and it can be a little bit of a West Wing-Mad Men chatty vibe. Thrillers tend to be rather narrow. The beauty and the limitation to them is they’re very narrow. You can have a little gallows humor along the way, but you’ve kind of got to keep turning that screw. I try to pick things where I’m like, 'Can I do that? I’m not sure. So let me try.' I think all writers do that."" Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV, added, “It has been thrilling to watch The Morning Show go from strength to strength over the past two seasons, exploring topical storylines that have resonated with audiences around the world while also being incredibly addictive and entertaining. We’re excited to see where Charlotte takes these extraordinary characters in Season 3 and to watch the magic that Jennifer, Reese and our awe-inspiring cast continue to bring to the captivating world of morning television.” Steve Carell Season 2 of The Morning Show was quite a rollercoaster ride for Alex. She revealed her part in the #MeToo situation at the show; as a result, she, along with Bradley, tried to shake things up at The Morning Show; she got her divorce; she was worried that she would be “canceled” when Maggie Brener’s book came out; and she completely fell apart when she learned of Mitch’s (Steve Carell) death; and then she contracted COVID-19. “It was relentless! Honestly, I did think at one point the writers were trying to kill me!” Aniston told The Hollywood Reporter. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. You guys! Literally crawling to the finish line here.'” Bradley also had her share of ups and downs with her relationship with girlfriend Laura Peterson. First not wanting to come out, and then having to deal with Cory Ellison declaring his love for her. Laura headed to Montana to quarantine, so when Bradley’s brother came to town and had a mental breakdown and disappeared, Cory was there for her. “I’m really interested in their love triangle between Laura and Cory, the complexity of the chemistry she has with Cory,” Witherspoon told The Hollywood Reporter. “But, again, it’s a person she works with, so I’m really curious how it all plays out.” Season 2 of the series also tackled the COVID-19 pandemic, ending in March 2020 just before the first shutdowns in New York City. In fact, Season 2 ended like Season 1 with The Morning Show going black after a broadcast in which Alex’s final words were: “Stay safe and stay sane.” Related: Reese Witherspoon Gives Us a Sneak Peek of What’s Coming for The Morning Show Season 2  You bet! The two formed a close bond on the set of Friends, where Aniston played Rachel Green and Witherspoon portrayed Rachel's younger sister Jill in Season 6. To celebrate Witherspoon's birthday in March 2022, Aniston took to Instagram to share a throwback pic of the two in character on the set of Friends. It hasn't been announced yet, but there will probably be 10, like Seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 of The Morning Show will be exclusively available to stream on Apple TV+. The first two seasons are also available to stream there now.

Now that the cast has wrapped filming the third season, fans are dying to know when season 3 will air and be available to stream.   Keep reading to find out everything we know about season 3 of The Morning Show!  Apple TV has not announced a formal premiere date for season 3. However, multiple outlets report that it should start streaming sometime in the fall of 2023.  The Friends alum and the Legally Blonde actress confirmed via social media that they had 
finished filming the new season.  “That’s a wrap on season 3. Love love LOVE this @themorningshow crew,” Jennifer captioned a behind-the-scenes Instagram carousel post in February 2023, adding that there is, “so much more to come. “ Two days prior, Reese had also teased “the last days of shooting” in her own Instagram post.  In January 2023, Reese gave fans some insight into the third season’s storyline during an interview with Entertainment Tonight.  “It’s so good,” the Oscar winner gushed. “We obviously added Jon Hamm, which has been so fun. We have all these new cast members who have just upped the game.” She added that the upcoming season will include “lots more romance” but didn’t specify which characters would be the focus of that topic. However, her character, Bradley Jackson, was involved in a love triangle. So, the romantic drama may involve her.  To recap, Jennifer’s character, Alex Levy, was put through a firestorm after her relationship with sexual predator Mitch Kessler (portrayed by Steve Carrell) was revealed. Once viewers of her daytime news show learned about Alex’s personal life amid her divorce, the character faced severe scrutiny and later tested positive for COVID-19 in the season 2 finale. Not only that, but she also had to make amends with Mitch’s sudden death.  Season 2 took a realistic turn as it mirrored the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, showing how New York City faced lockdowns amid the skyrocketing numbers of ill patients. As a result, the series’ titular news show planned for remote work.   Apart from that, Bradley got tied up in a love triangle, as Cory Ellison, whose girlfriend is away, admitted that he had feelings for her.   The multiple major cliffhangers left fans anxiously waiting to find out what will happen to the characters as they adjust to the “new normal” that 2020 required.  It appeared that the second season’s storyline left Jennifer disillusioned. Following the November 2021 finale premiere, the We’re the Millers actress told The Hollywood Reporter that she was unsure whether she would reprise her role in the future.   “It’s so hard to even imagine it right now,” Jennifer admitted at the time. “You know, when they say mothers almost have a block [after giving birth]: ‘I could never do that again!’ I’m a little bit in that moment of, ‘I don’t know if I could ever do that again!’ So, we’ll see.” In April 2023, Apple TV+ announced that the hit series was renewed for season 4 before they confirmed season 3 premiere details.

,,10 Things You Should Know About Jennifer Aniston’s Return To The Small Screen,"(Photo: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Jennifer Aniston is back on the media circuit giving interviews to promote her upcoming TV series The Morning Show, the biggest bauble in Apple’s new TV streaming service, Apple TV (which launches November 1st). The ten-episode dramedy is set in the surprisingly cutthroat world of morning news, and is maybe the first TV series with an explicitly post-#MeToo premise. In a new New York Times profile, Aniston talks about her small screen comeback, her favourite wellness ritual and displays a fondness for a certain Canadian fashion statement. Here's everything we learned… The profile opens with a description of seven women boarding a plane for Mexico (Jen’s favourite vacation destination, for anyone who hasn’t been reading Us Weekly for the past fifteen years). This particular trip was to celebrate her big 5-0 and her gang was mostly women she has known since before she became Rachel. Everything was going well, until the pilot explained that a missing tire meant they would have to turn around mid-flight and head back to California. Even before they hit the ground, the media had reported an “emergency landing” for the world famous Friends alum. The gang finally got to Mexico and on night one they gathered in a “goddess circle” to toast Jen’s next chapter. The ritual (where the women sit cross-legged on cushions and pass around a talking stick decorated with feathers and charms) is something they’ve been doing for three decades now. There was a goddess circle before both of Jen’s weddings and for everyone else’s major milestones, too. A goddess circle, btw, is a kind of new agey spiritual practice where participants share their feelings and set goals in a non-judgmental environment Even as she describes the goddess circle ritual, she seems to clock that the whole thing might sound a little West Coast woo-woo to your average NYT reader. “Should we just call it a circle?” she jokes. During the interview, which takes place in Aniston’s gorgeous Bel-Air home, she has her terrier mix Clyde in her lap and jokes that she’s “like a weird dog person, it turns out, like a dog lady.” (Also worth noting: Jen’s gal gang did a goddess circle after she and her ex Justin Theroux said goodbye to their dog Dolly earlier this year.) On The Morning Show Aniston plays Alex Levy, “a serious morning anchor whose personal life is complicated and professional life is more so, compounded by the sudden firing of her longtime co-host (played by Steve Carell) for sexual misconduct.” Sound familiar? Yes, the show is loosely based on what happened on Today with former host Matt Lauer, who was fired in 2017 for ""inappropriate sexual behaviour"". Jen first got involved with the project before Harvey Weinstein was busted and before Lauer was fired. When that happened, “We basically just started over,” says Reese Witherspoon who is Jen’s co-star on the show and who is quoted in the article. As any self-respecting Central Perk-er is well aware, Witherspoon played Rachel Green’s spoiled sister Jill (the one who hooked up with Ross, not the one who pierces baby Emma’s ears). “We were so psyched,” says Witherspoon of the chance to work together again, nothing the rarity of a show that has “two very, fully fleshed out female leads in one project.” While Aniston gets a lot of attention for her famous friends (and Friends), it turns out her bestest of besties is Kristin Hahn, her long-time producing partner and friend of more than three decades. Hahn is part of the 50th b-day gang that knew her when. (They call themselves “The Hill People”, btw. Because they all lived on the same street in Laurel Canyon back in the day.) As well as starring on the show, Aniston is also a producer. Her style is described as “detail-oriented” (by Hahn), “thorough” (by series creator Michael Ellenberg) and “involved with every set, with every costume, with every piece of casting” (by Witherspoon). Hearing about her colleagues words Aniston says that they are all, “basically nice ways of saying ‘obsessive.’” So expect something several shades darker. The profile makes specific mention of a line (one that Aniston hesitated to deliver) that involved an f-bomb and a vagina reference. But if the Alex character is a little fonder of expletives than her real life alter ego, Aniston says there is a lot of common ground. “I relate in ways of feeling like, when you don’t want to be seen, and you don’t want to go out of the house, and you want to just scream, and you don’t want to walk on a red carpet. I don’t want to stand behind a podium, I don’t want to have my photograph taken, I want to just cry today. You know?” In the accompanying photos, someone is clearly feeling her Canadian tuxedo.

,,Jennifer Aniston Salad,"The Jennifer Aniston Salad is fresh, crunchy, and packed with plant-based protein. Enjoy this light, gluten free salad as a healthy lunch or dinner. This post may contain affiliate links.  Alternatively titled, “The One with the New Lunchtime Obsession.” I don’t know about you but anytime I hear the name “Jennifer Aniston” followed by pretty much anything else, I’m in. If it works for Jennifer Aniston, it works for me! That said, I recently stumbled upon a dish that Jen once described as her “perfect salad” and I couldn’t resist making it the very same day. Ding, ding, ding – we had a winner! The Jennifer Aniston Salad is fresh, crunchy, healthy, and packed with plant-based protein. I’ve been eating it on repeat as a light lunch and protein-filled snack after a challenging workout. Could this salad BE any more health goddess-esque?! If you’re a Friends television show fanatic then you probably know that Jennifer Aniston reports that she ate the same salad every day for 10 years with co-stars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow while filming the series. THIS salad is not THAT salad. The salad Jen ate on the set of Friends was a Cobb Salad, while this salad is a riff on a tabbouleh. She shared it years ago on Instagram with the caption “My perfect salad”, and was nice enough to also list the ingredients that were inside her bowl. Celebrities — they’re just like us! This recipe makes a TON of salad which is great because you can portion it out for easy lunches all week long. Simply mix everything up, including the dressing, then scoop into individual size storage containers, or wide-mouth mason jars with lids. Add any protein or additional lettuces on top then cover. Voila — instant, healthy lunches for the week! Personally I think this quinoa and chickpea salad is totally satisfying on its own, but feel free to pair it with additional protein / healthy fats. Here are some ideas: The Jennifer Aniston Salad has been SO well received by readers and what I love is that they’ve found ways to make it their own! Here are some ideas on how to put your own spin on this viral salad recipe: Fresh, crunchy, and healthy to boot, I hope you’ll give this gorgeous salad a try! Let’s get to it.  Step 1: Cook quinoa in chicken or vegetable stock. Bring chicken or vegetable stock to a boil in a small pot then add the dry quinoa, turn the heat down, and then cover and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the stock has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork. The cooking process is very similar to cooking rice. You’ll know the quinoa is done when it “pops” into what look like tiny little springs. The texture is so great.  Scoop the quinoa into a storage dish or large bowl with a lid to cool before placing into the refrigerator to chill completely. Tip: I usually do this a day ahead of time so the chilled quinoa is ready to toss together with the other ingredients.  Step 2: Assemble. Once the quinoa is chilled, add all your goodies. We’ve got canned chickpeas that have been drained and rinsed, chopped pistachios, crumbled feta cheese, diced cucumber, and minced red onion.   Plus lots of chopped fresh herbs including parsley and mint. SO GOOD.  Step 3: Make the Lemon Dressing. Last step is to whisk up a simple Lemon Dressing to dress the salad with. To a small mixing bowl, or to a mason jar with a lid, add equal parts lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, plus with a drizzle of honey, and pinches of salt and pepper. Whisk or shake to combine.  Step 4: Dress the salad.  Drizzle however much of the lemon dressing you’d like over the quinoa salad then toss to combine – you do NOT need to add all the dressing! Serve right away or stash in the refrigerator for later!  Store the dressed salad in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. You can store it in the big mixing bowl with a lid, or scoop into individual size storage containers. This salad also makes great mason jar salads! Scoop into wide-mouth mason jars then grab and go! I hope you love this simple yet seriously stunning quinoa salad from Miss Jennifer Aniston herself!

,,Jennifer Aniston Salad,"Check out my new cookbook! → HOME RECIPE INDEX JENNIFER ANISTON SALAD 4.97 289 PUBLISHED APR 21, 2022, UPDATED OCT 06, 2023 This post may include affiliate links. Thank you for your support. Here’s how to make the viral Jennifer Aniston salad with quinoa or bulgur, cucumber, fresh herbs, pistachios, chickpeas and feta all tossed in lemon juice and olive oil. Given my love for salads, I just had to try Jennifer Aniston’s salad that went viral on TikTok! Some sources say she ate the salad every day for 10 years while filming the show Friends, but after a little research I found that this is actually a salad she shared while doing an Instagram takeover for the Living Proof brand. It’s no longer on Instagram, but you can still find it on the Way Back Machine (aka the best site for looking up old content). This post was from 2015 and in the caption Aniston said the salad, with bulgur, cucumbers, parsley, mint, red onion, chickpeas, feta cheese and pistachios was her “perfect salad.” And according to an article in the Los Angeles Times, the salad she ate daily on the set of Friends with her co-stars Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox, was a spruced up Cobb salad with turkey bacon and chickpeas. Sounds delish and probably similar to my vegan Cobb salad, but with turkey bacon. Either way, after trying Jen’s tabbouleh-inspired salad I can totally see why she (and the whole internet) is obsessed. It’s not only delicious and packed with SO much flavor, but it also has the perfect amount of protein, smart carbs, healthy fats, and veggies – all the components of a good meal-sized salad. Jen’s original version of this salad calls for bulgur wheat as the base, but when I went to make this salad for the first time I couldn’t find bulgur wheat anywhere, so I decided to make it with quinoa. It worked great and this salad is easily becoming a new staple in our house. This salad is super easy to whip up. To start, cook your quinoa according to the package (you can also follow my full tutorial on how to cook quinoa) directions until it has softened. Drain out any excess water, if needed. In a large bowl, combine cooked quinoa, cucumbers, parsley, mint, red onion, pistachios, chickpeas, feta, lemon juice, olive oil, sea salt, and pepper. Taste and add more salt or pepper if necessary. When it comes to cooking quinoa to use for salad, it’s basically the same process as normal, but I like to make my quinoa a day in advance, let it cool and chill it in the fridge overnight and then use it for the salad the next day. Prepping it in advance is just so the quinoa doesn’t heat up the other salad ingredients. Of course it’s fine to cook it the same day and just let it cool a bit before using. I do this all the time when I’m in a rush! I love meal prepping this salad for lunches throughout the week! It stores so well and even tastes better the next day as the ingredients have time to soak up more of the flavors. To store, place leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

I am glad you’re loving this salad and it turned out amazing for you! Thanks of your review & star rating, I appreciate it! Wow!!

I am SO glad you found this recipe and are loving it, Samita. Thank you for sharing your review + star rating, I really appreciate it! Thats a lot of calories for such a small serving and not a lot of protein. What else do you have with less calories and more protein? Hi Mitchell – You can always add some salmon or chicken to this recipe for additional protein. This was a great recipe! I like spice and flavor, so I added chili and cayenne to the quinoa. I also found jalapeño/lime flavored pistachios and it added that perfect flavor. The only thing I will do differently next time is go less on the lemon. Thanks for the recipe! AHHH this is SO great to hear, Cheri. I am glad you gave this one a try and it turned out amazing. Love your additions, sounds like it was loaded with extra flavor.

Cook them? Use Dehydrated? Just leave them out? I think you could totally cook them or just leave them out. Can you have raw shallot? If so, that could be a good option. I couldn’t wait for this salad to cool down – I ate it when the quinoa was still warm Absolutely delicious – even without feta (added later). I’ve prepped 4 so I can share with a house guest in the next week. YAY! I am SO glad you loved this salad, Deborah! It is one of my absolute favorites.

,,Jennifer Aniston Is a Great Actor. The Morning Show Proves It.," “Guess what?” Jennifer Aniston declares to a table full of overbearing, arrogant network execs in the third episode of The Morning Show, “America loves me. And therefore I own America.” She’s not wrong. Her character, Alex Levy, is a longtime morning-show host and a darling of viewers: As the beloved face of the program, Levy leverages that adoration to get precisely what she wants, even as a phalanx of blue suits tries to put her out to pasture. Sitting at the head of that long mahogany slab, wearing a jumpsuit and matching cocoon coat as crimson as a Revolutionary War uniform, Aniston might just as well be talking about herself. America loves Jennifer Aniston. And therefore Jennifer Aniston owns America. I know an inordinate amount of information about Jen (what her friends call her!). She used to have a beloved dog, Norman, a Welsh corgi-terrier mix; after he died a few years back she had his name tattooed on her foot. When Aniston was married to Brad Pitt, they claimed their favorite thing to do together was stay in and order Mexican food, but dammit if she wasn’t at Mr. Chow a few nights a week. She’s godmother to Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco. She still wears belts with her jeans, like all the time, those thick, solid chestnut-colored ones. Chris McMillan, the stylist who manufactured the infamous Rachel do, still cuts her hair. If she weren’t an actress, Aniston would have been an interior designer; check Architectural Digest for the receipts on that one. Is it weird, how much I know? That I didn’t have to Google a single thing in that paragraph? That if competing in an Aniston-centric trivia night, I’d put my odds at knowing every single answer at, quite honestly, 100 percent? I don’t follow her obsessively, dig into fan sites, or hunt for information about her on TMZ. I read cover stories about her in major women’s glossies; I watch occasionally when she’s on Jimmy Fallon or pops up in Reese Witherspoon’s Instagram. Like most of you, I’ve seen all of Friends and about half her movies. And yet her habits and poses and wardrobe and lovers have burrowed so deeply into my brain that “Jen Aniston” is a topic I can confidently discuss for hours. Every lamely assembled cover story about Aniston will attest to the same things, in the same order. They usually open with her greeting the writer with a hug in one of her “zen” but “palatial” homes, with a wide, glowing view overlooking L.A. — a domestic metaphor so heavy it might wallop you off her balcony. Then comes the reminder that Aniston is toned and golden and the sun bounces off her Aveeno-smoothed skin like it’s the heat shield on a space vessel reentering Earth’s orbit. Last is the bit about Aniston as America’s Sweetheart, a retracing of all the other cover stories that came before this one, that each also traced out the story we know so well, of the romantic tragedy that she has bravely risen out of like a phoenix from the ashes, or some other graceful animal from any other type of wreckage. Every story about Jen Aniston is still one of “triumph” over “disappointment.” Once a year, you can count on reading this piece in a big, fancy glossy. Enter Alex Levy in The Morning Show, the closest Aniston may ever come to playing a pastiche of her own career and celebrity. It’s a role that a slew of Hollywood A-listers could have handled, but only Aniston can really embody. Levy hosts the most popular morning show in the industry, a faux Good Morning America with the Today show’s penchant for scandals. Publicly, she’s the pretty but aging face of morning news — there’s a spectacular scene in which Aniston grimaces in the mirror and pulls her facial skin taut, momentarily restoring her 1990s visage — but internally, network execs yank her around, refusing to renew her contract and dictating exactly how she ought to sit, stand, and speak on camera. It calls to mind how, in September, Aniston told the New York Times that she’s far from a stranger to sexist behavior in the industry, listing unnamed examples: “Agents, studios, finding out what this actor made versus that actor made.” Despite her spot on the top of the heap, Aniston — along with A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie — has, it seems, been scuttled along behind closed doors just as much as anyone. Levy, like Aniston, lives in a glass box way up in the sky, privileged beyond compare, geographically cloistered. (Though in the character’s case, it’s in Manhattan.) Levy has been forced to keep her separation from her husband secret to avoid tabloid scrutiny; Aniston wrote in 2016 that she and then-husband Justin Theroux were “harassed by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home who will go to shocking lengths to obtain any kind of photo,” and there are memorable photos of Aniston and Pitt walking a beach just as news came out that they were separating. As Aniston rose to fame in the late ’90s and early aughts, the film roles she took on matched the public’s perception of Rachel Green: almost all lead girlfriends or rom-com damsels in movies like She’s the One, The Object of My Affection, Picture Perfect, and Along Came Polly. The essence of Levy’s job isn’t to deliver the hard-hitting news, just as nobody wanted Kramer v. Kramer out of Aniston for most of her career. Instead, both Levy and Aniston are expected to be the nicest women in America, with the most smiley face, and the longest limbs, and not a whit of exasperation for the madhouse that is their lives. In an era of constant reinvention, Aniston has stayed refreshingly the same. That long, golden blonde hair. Simple, tailored clothes, almost always black for formal events, with the occasional metallic mini thrown in, or a red dress not dissimilar to Alex’s strapless number. Aveeno moisturizer, apparently. Her post-Pitt, post-Friends roles were, largely, a career extension of that sameness — more rom-coms like Rumor Has It and He’s Just Not That Into You. People want to see Aniston be harmlessly funny, and so she mostly tries. But it’s worth noting that Aniston is the most famous actress in the world who has never headlined an undoubted critical and box-office hit. Yet the times she’s broken out of the approachable-but-gorgeous-funny-lady roles have been, by far, the most fruitful of her career. There was The Good Girl, where she played a laconic store clerk who mooned around onscreen, and then Nicole Holofcener’s 2006 Friends With Money, where she played a pothead maid whose three best friends (Joan Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Frances McDormand) all, well, have plenty of money. It was a languid role cast perfectly against type, with Aniston the unexpected slacker to three other far less famous actresses’ successes. Then, in what is undoubtedly her best performance, she played Cake’s Claire Bennett, an opioid-addicted, grieving mother. Claire shuffles down her house’s lonely hallways and launches into wild rages, every bit of glamour stripped from her scarred and pockmarked face. When Aniston gives up on funny and reaches into darkness — perhaps accessing that tender region every cover story so laboriously irons onto her — she digs up deep wells of frustration and we can suddenly empathize with her beyond the role of lovelorn dumpee. If women adore Jennifer Aniston because on some level they relate to her romantic history, in Cake she proves herself an empathetic figure for the deepest levels of woe. But her roles in movies like Cake are almost beside the point: Aniston stays A-list famous for steadily remaining a sweetheart, for always showing up in the fitted Yves Saint Laurent tux or straight column gown, for good-naturedly letting the reporters into all of her hillside manses and giving them a very small piece of that heart that everyone (admit it) wants to be broken. There’s a strange discord between her persona and her best work, as if she’s played the golden girl so long that she simply can’t shake that role. That is, until The Morning Show.  The series revolves around the firing of Alex’s longtime on-air partner, Mitch (played delightfully in a variety of volumes by Steve Carell), after he’s accused of “inappropriate sexual conduct,” which he claims, repeatedly, was consensual. Network execs bring in West Virginia reporter Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon, with an appalling southern accent) for an on-air interview and then offer her a job, taunting Alex with the presence of a younger, fresher rival. Before Mitch’s rapid fall from grace, Alex was shuffling along — interviewing presidents, yes, but also handling the small, inane segments of morning shows that are meant to keep people chuckling as they pack school lunches or iron a shift dress. Mitch’s departure and Bradley’s arrival galvanize Alex like a bucket of cold water to the face. She steps out of a fog and drops the smile. She still has the adoration of the country, and she knows it, which turns her into a force. Stymied in her contract negotiations and her demand for co-host approval, Alex glides onstage at an industry awards show and sweetly announces Bradley as her Morning Show co-anchor — without consulting or warning the execs who are trying to pin her down. That night, called to explain herself in front of the network suits, is when she stares them down along that mahogany table and announces that from now on, she’ll be running things. Aniston has played a whirlwind before (ahem, Along Came Polly), but with The Morning Show there are stakes, which makes all the difference. She deploys all the best bits of her comedic training when she’s playing Levy backstage — the faces she makes while she’s stuck on a speakerphone chat, a forceful yank of her extensions when she’s off-air, a cell-phone-smashing bit that nearly careens into a Three Stooges routine — but zips herself up into a controlled glide the second she steps on set. Alex Levy seemingly gets no special joy from sitting Plasticine-like in front of the camera and offering the world what it wants from her. Aniston flicks that on-off switch like a pro, not just because she knows what it’s like to live in front of cameras, but because she knows what it’s like to live as a persona — the ray of sunshine, the good girl, the woman who causes no trouble. It’s the knowingness behind Aniston’s performance that lends it such weight: Some moments feel so personal, like that face-pulling moment, that it’s almost as if camera operators just waited for her to forget they were there. There is no zany “check out my chops” hand theater here, though the role is more physical and comedic than you might expect. (Aniston and Mark Duplass, who plays Alex’s executive producer, toss alternately exasperated and questioning faces back and forth that pivot from dueling to knowing in rapid succession.) She slides on a pair of glasses so firmly that I wonder if she’s been watching old tapes of Cronkite. As Levy, Aniston puts on a veneer of graciousness that fictional viewers of “The Morning Show” within The Morning Show would view as genuine, but we can see as an act. Every tic of her face is calculated to consider who is watching her, and whether she needs that person to adore her or fear her. This is Jennifer Aniston knowing and performing Alex Levy’s fame, just as she, in turn, performs her own fame. In the fourth episode, Bradley utterly implodes while trying to “introduce herself to America,” accidentally spilling the beans on air that she had an abortion when she was a teenager. Alex knowingly nods, trapped between panic and professionalism. Aniston turns on a simpering voice, “Thank you, for opening up, Bradley,” but the second the cameras cut out, her voice drops an octave and she demands, “Did you fuck up just now, or was that intentional?” — more mob boss than spot of morning sunshine. Both Aniston and Levy have a perfect sense of when and how to use their power. The next morning, Alex picks up Bradley in her SUV to drive her back to the studio, to “get back on that horse.” When Bradley moans about the job, Alex replies, “All jobs are fucked up. You do things you don’t necessarily choose to do in exchange for relevance and money, and you cannot let it kill you.” In that moment it’s hard to know if it’s the actress or the character talking. There’s a thrill in Aniston that translates onto the screen in The Morning Show, like she’s finally taking a leap into unlikability and it feels better than she expected. Perhaps it’s the joy of playing a member of the media, that industry that has so gleefully earned dollar after dollar off her tragic divorces and invented pregnancies and sculpted biceps. Or of simply upending expectations by jumping into the Me Too fray with a prestige drama. But really, it feels like she’s laughing. Here is Jen Aniston, back on TV after 15 years away, playing a woman who knows exactly what it feels like to be watched and judged and considered too old or too silly to do the real, heavy work. A woman who peers down at the city from her penthouse and climbs daily into chauffeured black SUVs and has a hive of makeup artists brushing over the merest glimmer of shine, lest anyone see the imperfection. Here is Aniston, back on the medium that launched her career, this time telling the America’s sweetheart inside herself to fuck off. “I can guarantee that you are underestimating me,” Levy tells that long table of men, “and I am really fucking over people doing that.” Aniston might as well have written the line herself.

,,"Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and ‘Morning Show’ Cast Unpack Season 2 Finale","  For the second season in a row, the Apple TV+ drama ends with a broadcast where ""there’s no filter and there’s just the truth,"" Aniston tells The Hollywood Reporter. BY JACKIE STRAUSE  [This story contains spoilers to the second season finale of Apple’s The Morning Show, “Fever.”] Jennifer Aniston has been put through the wringer playing Alex Levy on The Morning Show.  After rocking her world as she knew it by exposing her longtime, beloved co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) as a sexual predator, the Apple TV+ drama set Alex on a two-season, rollercoaster journey of self-reflection. She publicly exposed her own #MeToo-era complicity, attempted to take down and reshape a network, went through a divorce, retired; then she made a comeback, was lauded as a feminist hero, faced being “canceled” over her relationship to Mitch, suffered a near-breakdown, grieved the death of Mitch, made amends — and then, in the finale, she tested positive for COVID-19.   “It was relentless! Honestly, I did think at one point the writers were trying to kill me!” Jennifer Aniston joked to The Hollywood Reporter about the whiplash from the cascading hits that kept coming at Alex. (The star summed up the emotions with seven different emojis on Instagram.) “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. You guys! Literally crawling to the finish line here.'”  Alex suffered severe symptoms after picking up COVID-19 from her trip to Italy to see Mitch. And to hear showrunner Kerry Ehrin tell it, the fever that Alex experienced was symbolic of the entire Morning Show journey. “The fever to me was almost representative as a fire that burned her, and she rises out of it like a phoenix with a better sense of her true self and the person she wants to be,” Ehrin told THR about Alex’s season-ending broadcast of The Morning Show, streamed from her living room, where she encouraged others to take a hard look in the mirror while shedding light on her own process of doing just that. For the second season in a row, The Morning Show cut to black after a broadcast, this time with Alex’s parting words to “stay safe and stay sane.” The abrupt ending leaves lingering questions as to where the morning news drama could go next, especially while it awaits a season three renewal. Elsewhere in the episode, COVID is rapidly spreading through New York City as the country unknowingly sits on the cusp of lockdown, back in March of 2020; Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) has just confessed his love for Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), whose girlfriend Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies) is in Montana to wait out the virus; and the Morning Show crew is planning to set up remotely to ready for work amid the looming pandemic.   Below, Ehrin, Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Margulies, Billy Crudup and Greta Lee — who all spoke to THR at the start of the season — weigh in on the season two ending while sharing their thoughts about where things could go next. Alex Emerging After COVID Mitch’s death brought about a marked shift in Alex when the struggling anchor began to accept her flaws and hold herself accountable. “I think that moment when she learns of the news, the bottom drops out and that’s it,” explains Aniston. “She realizes, ‘I don’t want the [Morning Show] deal. I don’t want to be this.’ She sort of goes to all the ghosts of the past to make amends and is almost tying up loose ends in order to say, ‘I can’t. That’s it. That’s a wrap.'” But it wasn’t until she came down with serious symptoms of COVID-19 that she reached acceptance. “It’s a portrayal of what happens to a person being that broken down and that kind of surrendered because your body is so sick, where there’s no filter and there’s just the truth,” says Aniston of Alex’s unabashedly honest finale broadcast. “She’s hit: Fuck it. And doesn’t give a shit what anybody thinks anymore. She’s spent the whole season trying to plug up all the holes in the canoe so she could not be found out, this desperation. But now she’s saying, unapologetically: This is who I am, this is what I am.”   Executive producer Mimi Leder, who directed the finale among other season two episodes, describes the final scene as a tidal wave hitting Alex. “Alex goes on a very important journey where she questions: Is she still relevant? She was so fearful of Maggie’s book, like it’s really going to hurt her existence. She was a very fearful person at the start of the season and she really goes on a journey of self-discovery and of enormous change and really looks in that mirror,” she says. “For the end sequence, we wanted it to feel more like a prayer than a pronouncement. That it was Alex saying: This is what I hope for, this is what I wish for; this is what I want it to be. We really wanted it to be singular with her, alone, in some way having it be raw, naked and exposed. To be like a prayer.” Aniston, who also executive produces the Apple TV+ drama, doesn’t know if Alex’s onscreen experience with COVID will hold a larger impact on the audience, but she’s hopeful. “I think people still are not understanding the beast that [COVID] is,” she says. “I think people are living in an ignorance-is-bliss kind of world because it’s almost too much to really take a look at it. If you really did, people would have hopefully gotten their act together and listened to the science and understood that, if you want an end to this, there is a means to it.” As for how Alex will emerge, Ehrin previously told THR: “A part of the character of Alex that I always imagined is that she had a public self and she had a private self, and they were very much apart. Her whole arc is about getting those two pieces together to create a whole that is authentic.” Bradley’s Love Triangle With Cory and Laura After embarking on a season-long romance with Laura, Bradley finds herself once again leaning on Cory for help as she searches for her missing brother, who struggles with addiction. Laura had escaped to Montana amid the looming coronavirus, but the pair had solidified their relationship before they parted. When Cory confesses to Bradley that he loves her, Bradley is too preoccupied with finding her brother to give him a proper reaction, leaving the confession hanging in the COVID-swirling air.   “I’m really interested in their love triangle between Laura and Cory, the complexity of the chemistry she has with Cory,” says Witherspoon. “But, again, it’s a person she works with, so I’m really curious how it all plays out.” Overall, the star and executive producer says her hopes for Bradley are broader: That she’s not so hard on herself. “I think we’re all hard on ourselves and she’s a character who comes from a pretty complicated past that she still hasn’t really reconciled,” she adds. “Her relationship with her brother is really complex and I’m really interested in what the next step would be with her and her brother, because it’s such a big piece of her life. Your siblings can really define you, and either help you or torpedo you.” On the opposite end is Laura, a woman Margulies has described as “so comfortable and calm, that you want Bradley to find refuge.” Having previously summed up their connection as a “safe-haven relationship,” Margulies says she wants to return and see how Laura and Bradley will fare, if that’s in the cards for the show: “I don’t know where it’s going to go, but I really love their relationship and I think that even the little bit that you saw will change Bradley, whether or not Bradley is with her or not.”   Crudup also remains unaware of what Cory’s declaration will bring. One thing he and Bradley have in common, he says, is their impulsiveness. “It was such a shocking moment for Cory to realize that [he loves Bradley],” says Crudup. “When he says it to Bradley, I think it’s truly a discovery. Whether it happened to him just in that moment or the day before, it wasn’t something that he’s been sitting on for four months [the timeline of seasons one and two].” He continues, “He’s been a caretaker in a way. What he was really concerned about was the well-being of this precious person to him and being able to articulate that that was also him being in love with her, it would have been impossible until that moment.” Indeed, it was a bumpy road to get to this point, after Cory betrayed Bradley by exposing her relationship with Laura in the press — something Bradley remains in the dark about. “I don’t think that was the motivation for him trying to undermine her relationship with Laura,” Crudup says about Cory’s feelings, “but I [also] don’t know what kind of potential there is in the future [with Cory and Bradley].” The Future of UBA (and UBA+) The first season of The Morning Show tracked the ascension of rising executive Cory. But, as Ehrin has noted, everything looks different from the view at the top. The second season ends with the UBA CEO nervously taking stock of his NYC surroundings on the brink of the COVID outbreak and on the precipice of his industry, as well as every other industry, facing a survival need to adapt. Amid all of that, coupled with a failure to launch streamer UBA+, how will Cory push ahead professionally? “I’ve been playing him as a ruthless gamer for a couple years, so I would be disappointed if we didn’t keep that up,” says Crudup. “One thing about that kind of person is, they’re willing to get in those hostile environments because they’re willing to take a punch. And he better get knocked on his ass so that they can maybe reveal the depths of his actual strength.”   Meanwhile his mentee, UBA president Stella Bak (Greta Lee), also finds herself faced with figuring out how to lead amid unforeseen challenges. “There’s an endless amount of drama because this is a workplace drama, that’s the magic of this,” Lee has said about her hopes to return “as a boss, yes.” She added, “It feels like an athletic event being on this show, what’s required of you in terms of pace and stamina. And it’s been a real joy to be able to step up and play ball with these guys.” Their Hopes for a Season 3 Despite waiting on a season three renewal, Ehrin said she did not approach the ending to season two as a series finale. “You can’t write every year as a possible series finale and have them have any value after a certain point. We wanted to write about the time, those three months, and the characters in that time and how they all wound up. So, no I don’t think it’s written as an end to the series at all,” she said.   If the show returns for season three, Ehrin also said she has no interest in picking up right where they left off. “I think it’s going to have been done, done, done. So, it wouldn’t be my instinct,” she said of capturing the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, she acknowledged that the possibilities are endless: “You could [jump into the future]. You could go backwards. It’s such an interesting little universe. You really can put it anywhere in time, and I think the challenge of the show is coming up with that big subject.” The idea that the first two seasons could serve as bookends to two major moments in recent history (#MeToo and the pandemic), also appeals to Aniston, who says she is still sitting with season two. “It’s so hard to even imagine it right now,” she says when asked about doing more, comparing the release of the season to birthing a baby. “You know when they say mothers almost have a block: ‘I could never do that again!’ I’m a little bit in that moment of, ‘I don’t know if I could ever do that again!’ So, we’ll see.” What would she like to happen to Alex next? “Oh, just a lot of love and fun and dancing and playing and something with a lot more levity!” Witherspoon, who says they are “talking about” and “definitely planning a season three,” also imagines a post-COVID future for The Morning Show. “If #MeToo was the center of season one and season two has so many issues but really tackles the impending pandemic, I would love to see how the world realigns post-quarantine,” she says. “Even though that seems optimistic to say at this point, with people still dealing with the complexity of COVID and really what it’s doing to different industries. But just, how the whole world has culturally shifted in so many ways; the way we communicate and work, the way we talk to each other — there’s definitely a lot to talk about and tackle.” The Status of a Season 3 The Morning Show team is waiting on a renewal from Apple. “We haven’t had an official pickup for a third season. We’re waiting on that,” said Ehrin, who has an overall development deal with the streamer. When asked if she envisions one or more seasons, or plans to take a beat before returning to The Morning Show‘s writers room, Ehrin replied: “That’s a huge question. I feel like the show has a lot of different projections that would work for it. I think right now, I just finished a season that has taken two years. I am just taking a break! (Laughs.) I do have a development deal [at Apple] and I am working on some other projects that I’m excited about. And, that being said, I love the show and I dearly love the cast of the show and I hope it continues.” Should the Morning Show continue, viewers can gleam what they like about how Ehrin summed up the first two seasons, and whether or not they escaped the “wreckage” of trying to dismantle and change — amid a looming pandemic: “They didn’t realize there was another mountain that was going to fall on them! I think probably that’s just the story of life. There’s always another mountain that’s going to fall on you.

,,TV Review: Jennifer Aniston Dazzles In the Frustrating Yet Eminently Watchable The Morning Show,"Apple's star-studded series is highly effective as a watchable, soapy drama The Pitch: Alex Levy’s (Jennifer Aniston) alarm goes off one morning at 3:30 a.m., her usual time. She goes through her routine—Red Bull while making coffee, under-eye patches and a jade roller, hair maintenance, pack bag, put the wedding ring back on, and out the door to her driver. But this morning, her phone won’t stop ringing. She doesn’t answer—avoidance, irritation, apathy, or some cocktail of the three keeps pushing her to ignore what’s obviously urgent. She pulls up outside the studio of her glossy, ratings-dominant morning show, and the caller (Mark Duplass) stands on the sidewalk. He’s got bad news: Her cohost of 15 years, Mitch Kessler, a cuddly mom-friendly teddy bear of a man (Steve Carell), has been fired for sexual misconduct. Then it all, as they say, goes sideways. Around the time Alex goes on the air, things are also getting pretty nuts for Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), a charismatic correspondent for a West Virginia news station. While attempting to cover a protest at a coal mine, a counter-protester throws off her cameraman, leading to an altercation between Jackson and the assailant—one that’s caught on camera, and quickly goes viral. That moment in the spotlight grabs the attention of network bigwig Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), who tosses Bradley into the middle of the network’s storm. It’s chaos, but as Ellison says in one of The Morning Show’s bewildering early episodes, “Chaos is the new cocaine.”  The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Look, Movie Stars! Apple proudly describes its service as “all originals”; you’ll find no Golden Girls or Happy Days here. The company is betting you’ll cough up for their new service and these new series all the same, and it’s safe to assume much of their confidence comes from the fact that they locked down Aniston, Witherspoon, Carell, Crudup, and Duplass—only five members of an almost uniformly excellent ensemble cast, but five (the first three in particular) who happen to have major name recognition and loads of star power. Seeing bona fide movie stars in series regular roles on television is no longer a total rarity—this isn’t even Witherspoon’s first this season—but their presence indicates a certain level of prestige and promises loads of charisma, if nothing else. Luckily, it’s not just charisma. Though the contradictory, tonally inconsistent scripting (more on that later) makes for some moments that are difficult for even these big shots to sell, there’s enough going on here to set most, though not all, of them up for serious success. There’s not a scene in The Morning Show that Jennifer Aniston doesn’t seize with both hands and squeeze, like she’s determined to get every last possible drop of juice out of every orange she’s handed, no matter how underripe. In those hands, Alex is a brand, a performer, a carefully curated image; she’s also the person behind the mask, and that not so nice, not so collected person is in total chaos. Hers isn’t the only great performance on the show—Witherspoon is just as good, though Bradley, by virtue of her situation, doesn’t have quite as much to do. Crudup is the other standout, a kind of chaotic trickster god about whom only one thing can be trusted: his sheer enjoyment of the madness that surrounds him, and especially that which he creates. He’s magnetic. Duplass is also good, and amongst the supporting players, both Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Karen Pittman stand out each playing a Morning Show staffer whose burdens are heavy and growing heavier. Good acting: you’ll find it here.  Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell in The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Actors Aren’t Superheroes: On the other hand, Steve Carell doesn’t fare particularly well. A great actor can gloss over or justify some lackluster writing, though not entirely, and Carell is certainly a great actor, but by and large, Mitch’s presence tends to reduce the complexity of any episode he enters. It’s clear that the opposite was intended, and every so often that’s what happens. The Morning Show functions best as an exploration of systemic failure and corruption, of how a group of well-meaning people can grow to view toxic, harmful, abusive behavior as just the way things are. It’s not always subtle about that—just wait for the flashback to the day the Harvey Weinstein story breaks—but at its best, it’s searing, demanding the viewer to question the things they’ve written off as somehow acceptable. (A late-arriving episode centered largely on Mbatha-Raw’s character is particularly hard to watch.) Mitch throws all of that off-balance. The idea behind the casting is clear—Carell is the man whose inherent warmth made an acidic U.K. sitcom called The Office into something gentler, and as a not-at-all-thinly-veiled Matt Lauer figure, he’s supposed to be disarming, kindly, the kind of person who could never be a serial abuser. When he’s a ghost that haunts the hallways, that works. When he’s a person grappling with a world that’s shifting around him, it’s a mess: sometimes engaging, usually bewildering, often frustrating. (At one point he says, “First they came for the rapists…” and forgive the intrusion of the personal, but my soul left my body.) The character muddies the water, but not in an interesting way; Mitch is considerably less interesting than the rest of the show or the actor who plays him. There’s just too much, and it’s all nuclear-strength. Worst of all, the few Mitch scenes that feel vital and essential are just less effective because of all the rest.  Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Let’s Roll: If the writing often stumbles, particularly where Mitch is concerned, it can also be fascinating, and showrunner Kerry Ehrin and her writers’ room rack up more hits than misses. But even when the story doesn’t work (and it gets really, really messy at various points throughout, from the chaotic pilot to the heavy-handed “ripped from the headlines” moments) it all looks great. Executive producer Mimi Leder (The Leftovers) leads a murderers’ row of directors, including Lynn Shelton (GLOW) and Michelle MacLaren (Breaking Bad). The episodes are typically expertly-paced and elegantly filmed, the glossiness of the on-camera world a sharp contrast to the darkness beyond the lights. Above all, these directors capture the staggering wealth of these characters—a level of excess that’s never filmed aspirationally. It baffles. MacLaren and Leder do this especially well. These cars, apartments, bags, shoes, balconies, sofas, elegant meals—they’re all part of a trade these people made, a visible demonstration of the incentive to stay silent. Sure, there are too many walk-and-talks, but there’s also a sense of the camera as witness, capturing the expert lies the characters tell themselves, the moments of self-recrimination they can’t totally hide.  The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  The Verdict: The Morning Show’s flaws are considerable, but they’re interesting flaws. It’s highly effective as a watchable, soapy drama, occasionally thrilling as a dissection of abuse in the workplace, and a top-tier showcase for a terrific ensemble of actors. It’s possible to imagine a version of this show that’s more sharp-toothed and less “timely”—something that baldly depicts the messiness of the world without veering quite so wildly between the didactic and the ridiculous. But that idealized show just doesn’t exist, just as the people Mitch and Alex pretend to be don’t really exist. But it’s worth pouring yourself a cup of coffee, putting on a cozy robe, and checking out The Morning Show. Where’s It Playing? The Morning Show is currently streaming on Apple TV+.

,,Apple TV Plus launching Friday with lowest price for major subscription service,"The company that brought you the Macintosh computer, iPhone, iPad and iTunes now wants you to turn to it for Apple-branded entertainment.  And to get you to sign up for the new Apple TV Plus service, launching Nov. 1, Apple is basically giving away the store.  Buy a new Apple hardware product – starting with the $199 iPod Touch, and continuing with the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV streaming box or Mac computer – and you get one year of service free. Historically, Apple sells more than 250 million of these devices a year, so this will clearly give Apple a massive head start in the ""Streaming Wars,"" where it will compete with Netflix (150 million subscribers), Amazon Prime Video (more than 100 million subscribers) and Hulu (28 million subscribers.) Apple's marketing bonus is why analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush Securities predicts that Apple TV Plus will have more than 100 million subscribers within its first three years. But can it keep them? Apple is launching Friday with only eight series, a documentary and a talk show, compared with the thousands of titles available on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. ""Apple needs a critical mass of programming, and eight shows is not a critical mass,"" says Peter Csathy, president of CREATV and an industry consultant. ""I can't imagine the case for Apple TV will be a small number of original shows. There's got to be more in the coming months."" The Apple TV+ fare: What you need to know:Details on all the new Apple TV Plus shows and movies And waiting in the wings: ""Servant"" from director M. Night Shyamalan (Nov. 28), ""Truth Be Told,"" with Octavia Spencer, Aaron Paul and Lizzy Caplan (Dec. 6), and several other series and movies that haven't been given airdates yet.  Apple will be bringing back Steven Spielberg's 1980s anthology series ""Amazing Stories"" and recently outbid HBO to get the third of Spielberg and actor/producer Tom Hanks' World War II projects, ""Masters of the Air.""   TV Plus was born out of shifting realities for Apple, which saw the iPhone gravy train peak and then start to slide in 2018, when unit sales began to dip for the first time. To keep investors satisfied and overall revenue higher than the year before, Apple shifted to a strategy of selling ""services."" It focused on Apple Music, iCloud storage, Apple Care extended warranties and the like to make money off its existing and massive base of customers. Services is now Apple's No. 2 division, bringing in more revenue than iPads, Mac computers or other hardware, but there's still a wide gap between iPhone revenue ($26 billion in the most recent quarter) and $11.4 billion for Services.  To take on Netflix and Disney, which is set to launch its own new service, Disney Plus, on Nov. 12, Apple opened up its checkbook. It hired two former executives from Sony Pictures and began bankrolling new series. ""It’s not about whether Netflix wins and we lose, or if we win and they lose,"" CEO Tim Cook told the German publication Stern recently. ""Many people use multiple services, and we are now trying to become one of them."" Apple is playing the Hollywood game. It has leased an entire building that's being erected in the heart of the trendy Culver City arts district as a base for its TV+ employees. That is just down the street from where Amazon's streaming operation is also based, at the vintage Culver Studios (home to such films as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Citizen Kane""). Netflix's L.A. operations are based in classic Hollywood, the old Sunset/Gower studios, a former home for such series as ""Saved by the Bell"" and ""Married...with Children.""  Apple cut deals with stars like Aniston and Witherspoon, legendary director Spielberg , J.J. Abrams (who has several series in the works for Apple) and many others. Apple, the master of staging million dollar  live streams to sell new hardware, recently staged its first red-carpet premiere for one of the TV+ shows, ""For All Mankind,"" renting out the historic Regency Village theater (seen in the recent Quentin Tarantino film ""Once upon a Time in Hollywood,"" when young Sharon Tate watches herself in a movie). Apple handed out mini-champagne bottles and glasses for guests to take to their seats, and handed out swag bags with freeze-dried ice cream.  With so few shows for your monthly subscription, Apple is taking a way different approach than Netflix and Amazon, which offer bulk for your subscription dollar.  Apple hasn't said whether it will offer its series on a ""binge viewing"" basis, as most shows on Netflix are presented.  Apple will have three episodes available of ""The  Morning Show"" available for viewing, with new episodes dropping every Friday, while the series ""Dickinson"" will have all 10 episodes ready for viewing. For now, Apple ""doesn't have enough content to stand on their own,"" says Luke Bouma, editor of the CordCuttersNews blog. ""But with the free year of access, that could buy Apple enough time to build a catalog of content to justify the price.""

,,"11 Ways to Style Leather Pants, Jackets, Skirts and More, According To a Pro Stylist","                                                                All the easy ways to incorporate the trending fabric into your wardrobe for less When it comes to a fabric that is versatile, looks luxe and is flattering on everyone, leather ranks at the top of the list. And while the classic textile has been used to create clothing for decades, it’s made a huge resurgence in recent years. But if you haven’t worn leather in a while and are hesitant to try it, don’t fret! Gone are the days when leather was only on tight, form-fitting garments, as it’s now found on roomy wide leg pants and shirt-like jackets. Need more convincing? We turned to creative fashion designer and stylist Catherine Bibeau for all her tips on how to style leather pants and other leather items so you’re left looking and feeling your best. Read on for all of the reasons why you should add leather to your wardrobe. For one, leather is extremely versatile. It can be dressed up or down, look edgy or feminine, come fitted or loose and is offered in a wide range of colors. For example, throwing on a leather trench can instantly elevate any ensemble, or opting a leather moto jacket can make a fancier dress look more casual.  Leather is also very flattering because of its ability to hug curves in all the right places, showing off the figure. And it also adds texture and dimension to an ensemble. “It is a chic piece that adds shine to any outfit,” says Bibeau, which creates a more interesting ensemble. Best of all, the fabric is typically very durable and can last you years. “Leather has historic durability and versatility,” attests Bibeau. “It became a classic piece to wear every day, even at work.” And even though some real leather pieces can seem pricey up front, it’s a good investment to consider because of the amount of wear you will get from the item. If you’re not willing to commit to real leather, faux leather options run the gamut and are equally as durable as the real thing. Leather pairs well with many different fabrics and materials, but whatever you pair it with, Bibeau says to make sure it’s something chic. “A nice pair of pants, a nice skirt or a dress,” all work great with leather items, she says. For a more casual outfit, try mixing denim with leather. A short leather moto jacket paired with your favorite pair of high-rise jeans balances the body and highlights your best assets. Or, take a colored pair of leather pants and throw on a jean jacket as the finishing touch. The contrast of fabrics make it visually interesting to the eye and play off each other perfectly. No matter what you decide to wear with leather, it’s best to steer clear of anything too bulky or thick, says Bibeau. “Always keep the under layer simple and keep the accent on the beauty of the jacket [or other leather item] itself,” she says. This will ensure the leather garment “fits like a glove.” One example of this is how “leather pairs well with a silk blouse or a flowing silk dress as it gives it structure, while thicker materials under your leather jacket only creates a puffy and unflattering look.” Lastly, Bibeau advises letting the leather piece have its moment and be the main star of the show. “The best advice is to go simple with leather and keep the focus of your outfit on the beauty of what leather brings on its own.” Keep scrolling to get some inspiration from celebrities 40 and older who showcase how easy it can be to pull off leather. From leather pants to jackets, skirts and shorts — there’s a piece for everyone. And best of all, we found similar styles to shop that won’t break the bank. We all love a tried-and-true pair of black pants like Andie MacDowell is rocking above. A style that flatters all body types? A high-waisted pair with a relaxed or “mom” fit (think mom jeans). This design is looser through the hips and thighs but fitted in the waist, showcasing an hourglass shape. And pleats along the front waistline add extra flair and flatter. And wearing with a striped button down and white heels brightens up the look while still appearing polished. Shop the look: Pink and white striped button down: Buy from Express, $17.45 Black high waisted leather pants: Buy from ella james, $60 White pumps: Buy from Amazon, $49.99 Black leather not for you? Not to fear, brown leather is here! If you find you look best in the warmer hue, there are plenty of brown leather pants on the market to choose from. Brown is great for a daytime look, as it typically looks less dressy than black. Just take inspiration from Tatyana Ali (above) who paired her brown leather pants with a tan sweater vest and simple white button down for an effortlessly chic ensemble. Shop the look: Light tan sweater vest: Buy from Nordstrom, $38.35 Cropped camel leather pants: Buy from Saks Fifth Avenue, $69.99 White button down shirt: Buy from Land’s End, $59.96 You can never go wrong with wearing various shades of one color, and this green outfit, as seen on Christie Brinkley above, proves just that. A pair of skinny leather pants in a darker green hue help carve out curves in an instant. And to balance out form-fitting leather pants, choose a top with a looser fit and tuck it into the pants. What’s more, a pair of neutral tan booties in a suede fabric keeps the eye scanning vertically to elongate the body. Shop the look: Chartreuse long sleeve top: Buy from Garnet Hill, $44 Dark green leather pants: Buy from Chico’s, $24.98 Tan suede booties: Buy from Amazon, $55.99 If you really want to play with different textures, try out leather pants that have an embossed animal print, like alligator or snake skin. Celine Dion (above) is proof at how the added texture on pants that have a slight flare at the ends create more interest to the look than typical black leather pants. And keeping the rest of the look in coordinating colors with a black turtleneck and black and gold tweed jacket Shop the look: Brown and black tweed jacket: Buy from Saks Off Fifth, $59.99 Black alligator print leather pants: Buy from Aritzia, $49.99 Black turtleneck long sleeve: Buy from Amazon, $17.99 As Bibeau mentioned previously, leather pants are a great option to wear for work. For a safe bet, choose a pair that isn’t super form-fitting (more straight leg or wide leg) and add a simple blouse and plain black pumps a la Katie Holmes above. Not only is this a work-appropriate ensemble, but it’s also trendy and looks more stunning than standard. Shop the look: White frilly blouse: Buy from Lulus, $24.50 Burnt orange leather pants: Buy from Selfie Leslie, $69.99 Black heels: Buy from Amazon, $19.21 A tie-belt leather jacket not only keeps you warm all day as a stylish extra layer, but the belt creates shape to the figure. This is a great way to ensure the leather topper doesn’t look boxy. And opting for one in a gorgeous green shade, like Kylie Minogue has on above, it pops against an all black outfit. Shop the look: Black sheath dress: Buy from Express, $52.80 Green Faux Leather Tie Jacket: Buy from Nordstrom Rack, $34.97 Black shaping sheer tights: Buy from Spanx, $28 One of the most populars ways to wear leather, aside from leather pants, is in a moto jacket varaition. The edgy piece is a staple item to add to your wardrobe, as it goes with essentially anything. It works well to dress down a nice dress, elevate a simple tee and jeans or take a look from day to night instantly. These jackets also come in a variety of colors, like the widely-loved burgundy shade as seen on Mary J. Blige above. And matching the jacket to a dress and bag not only creates a cohesive look but also makes the body appear instantly more statuesque. Shop the look: Burgundy midi dress: Buy from Artizia, $50.99 Burgundy leather moto jacket: Buy from Saks Off Fifth, $59.99 Brown and burgundy handbag: Buy from Michael Kors, $179 Like mentioned earlier, Bibeau loves the look of a good pair of jeans with leather. The contrast of fabrics is ultra-flattering to the eye, and truly so versatile. Take your favorite jeans and add a belted leather shacket (we love the pale yellow hue Garcelle Beauvais has on above!), and you have a chic look in seconds. Finish it off with a pair of fun and spunky heels, like these zebra print heels below. Straight leg jeans: Buy from Zara, $45.90 Pale yellow leather shacket: Buy from NA-KD, $48.96 Zebra print heels: Buy from Amazon, $53.40 The fun doesn’t stop at pants and jackets! Leather skirts and dresses are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to flatter essentially everyone. Leather gives a chic twist to a classic dress or skirt style, and is especially great for a nighttime look, such as a happy hour or girl’s night out. And a monochromatic look, like Courteney Cox is wearing above, with a coordinating turtleneck is slimming while dark slingback heels visually stretch the frame for a tall and trim silhouette over all. Related: 7 Midi Skirt Outfits For Every Occasion From Errand-Running to Cocktail-Sipping Shop the look: Blue long sleeve turtleneck: Buy from Amazon, $15.99 Blue leather midi skirt: Buy from Amazon, $36.99 Black slingback kitten heels: Buy from DSW, $59.99 Aside from black, red is up there as one of the most popular colors to wear when sporting leather. Because leather is typically seen as more “edgy” or “bold,” it makes sense that it’s often found in an edgy and bold color! Red is a classic shade that complements many skin tones and adds a bit of fiery flair to your ensemble. To make a big statement, take a nod from Priyanka Chopra Jonas, shown above, who wore an all-red look with a pair of snakeskin heels for added pizzazz. Shop the look: Red wrap blouse: Buy from Amazon, $46.99 Red leather midi skirt: Buy from Amazon, $29.99 Snake skin print slingback kitten heels: Buy from Kohl’s, $62.99 Jennifer Aniston as shown above, looks gorgeous in this leather mini dress. But if you prefer a bit more coverage, this look could also easily be recreated with high-rise leather shorts and a matching leather top. This is a great option for the warmer months when going out for dinner and drinks or even a concert. It will keep you cool and show off a tasteful amount of skin. To finish the look off, slip on a pair of embellished black heels. Shop the look: Black high-waisted faux leather shorts: Buy from Amazon, $19.99 High-neck faux leather top: Buy from Micas, $22 Black rhinestone studded heels: Buy from Amazon, $34.99 First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.

,,Jennifer Aniston Gushes Over Her Friendship With Reese Witherspoon,"“She is one of the most highly productive human beings I’ve ever encountered. It’s incredible.” Reese Witherspoon is a powerhouse. The star began her career in Hollywood as a teen in romantic comedy The Man in the Moon and went on to star in classics like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Alabama. More recently, she both produced and starred in award-winning television series like Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere, and Apple TV+’s The Morning Show (which recently announced its third season will premiere in September). She also has a Southern-inspired home and clothing brand, Draper James, runs a popular book club, and is a mom to three. So, how does she do it? Turns out not even she knows. “Gosh, I know. I get really excited about work, so I get tons of nervous energy,” Witherspoon tells Harper’s Bazaar for her August cover story. “I’m kind of a high-strung person.” Her friends, full of admiration for her, entirely agree. “I don’t have it in me to do what she does,” her Morning Show costar Julianna Margulies says. “Reese somehow manages to compartmentalize—and she’s good at being in charge.” Witherspoon has previously described herself as having the energy of “a squirrel who drank coffee,” but Big Little Lies costar Laura Dern has a kinder perspective on her close friend. Dern calls it a “magnificent holy ambition.” Because what propels Witherspoon is a simple mission: centering women’s stories. “I just look at her and I think, You absolutely exhaust me, just looking at your plate,” says Jennifer Aniston, Witherspoon’s Morning Show costar and co–executive producer. “She is one of the most highly productive human beings I’ve ever encountered. It’s incredible.” Witherspoon and Aniston have been friends for a long time, having run in the same Hollywood circles for decades. Before filming The Morning Show, they had worked together once before, when Witherspoon made a hilarious and memorable cameo on Friends as the sister of Aniston’s character, Rachel Green. Witherspoon talked about the meeting to Harper’s Bazaar back in 2019. “We met on the set of Friends; I played her sister. I was 23 years old and had just had a baby. I was nursing Ava on set, and Jen just kept going, ‘You have a baby?’ I was like, ‘I know, it’s weird,’” she said. “She was so sweet to me. I was really nervous, and she was like, ‘Oh, my gosh—don’t worry about it!’ I marveled at her ability to perform in front of a live audience like that with no nerves. They would change all the lines and she was just so effortlessly affable, bubbly, and sunny. We’ve been friends ever since.” Read the full August cover story here. Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture. Previously, she was a news editor at ABC News and, prior to that, a managing editor of celebrity news at American Media.

,,Jennifer Aniston: Why ‘The Morning Show’ felt like 20 years of therapy,                                            ,www.latimes.com,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-08-18/jennifer-aniston-morning-show-emmys-friends,
,,"'The Morning Show' Recap, Season 2, Episode 1: She's Blonde Again!","Linda Holmes Bradley (Reese Witherspoon) has a new look as the second season of The Morning Show kicks off.  It takes the second season of Apple TV+'s The Morning Show seven-and-a-half minutes to get real sweaty. Let's step back: The first season, which aired a decade or so ago in late 2019, was the prestige drama project that Apple wanted to use to launch its streaming service: Big names! Current events! Finger on the pulse! Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston played a newbie and a veteran morning show host, respectively, who are thrown together after Aniston's former on-air partner, played by Steve Carell, is fired following a sexual harassment scandal. But a funny thing happened on the way to acclaim: The show was of decidedly middling quality. (And by ""the show,"" I mean The Morning Show, not the show-within-the-show also called The Morning Show, which we shall call TMS here so we don't all lose our collective bearings.) Some elements, like Billy Crudup's gleefully weaselly executive Cory, worked. Other parts, like the plentiful scenes in which Mitch (Carell) felt sorry for himself, did not. The uneven season ended when Alex (Aniston) and Bradley (Witherspoon) blew the lid off of a culture of cover-ups at UBA, called out their big bosses on air with the help of Cory and show executive producer Chip (Mark Duplass), and ... fade to black. Cory (Billy Crudup) is as gross as ever, and as hard to entirely resist.  And so, Season 2 presents a curious question for The Morning Show: What do you do when your show has all the talent and money in the world, but the first season just didn't work? You can't just move on, because you're a tentpole for the streaming service you're working for, which might as well be called We Print Money TV+, and all they want is to make you a success. What do you do with a second season? Double down? Make changes? Push ahead? Oh, and remember, before you answer: Your first season about television production and the magic of being wealthy in New York City aired right before a pandemic hit and changed everything about television production and the magic of ... well, being wealthy somewhere while maintaining a residence in New York City. This is why I wanted to follow this show through this season — not because it's so good, and not because it's so loved, and not because I intend to drill down into its approximately four million subplots to make sense of every one. These episodes are a story in themselves. They are the story of how a huge, expensive project that came pre-loaded with publicity and talent and money and a current-events hook tries to move forward after nearly two years away. The season-two premiere opens with a couple of scenes showing the immediate aftermath of Alex and Bradley's big rebellion, which the show now seems to place sometime in early 2019. This sequence goes about the way you would expect, in that Alex's team is frantic to protect her and The Suits are furious. (""You're a dead man,"" says disgraced network boss Fred ""Angela Chase's father from My So-Called Life"" Micklen to Cory, to which Cory flatly responds, ""Said the corpse."") A Memo From The Department Of Calendar Pedantry: It appeared during Season 1 that it was taking place in late 2019, given that TMS was covering the 2019 California wildfires. But now, it seems like they've retconned that season's events to happen much earlier in the year, in order to have COVID strike when it's been many months since Alex quit. Then you get the credits (which remain excellent), and then there's a sequence in which ""Return To Me"" plays while a camera flies through the COVID-emptied streets of New York in March 2020. Then we move back ""three months earlier,"" to New Year's Eve, where we begin this season proper. So if you're keeping up, it's already been early 2019, then it was March 2020, and now it's New Year's Eve 2019. We are not at the eight-minute mark yet! BUT WAIT. Help is on the way, because once we are affixed to time and space, we cut to a blonde Bradley — that is to say, a blonde Reese Witherspoon — on The Morning Show singing ""What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?"" with Hasan Minhaj, who it takes a minute to understand is not playing himself. He is playing Eric, Bradley's new co-host, who came in after Alex quit in the spring. The two of them are promoting their New Year's Eve special, obliviously try-harding their way through the song, while the control room takes in news of yet another ugly UBA revelation that's gone public, this time involving allegations against the anchor of the evening news. Eric (Hasan Minhaj) is Bradley's partner on TMS — but not for long.  You can almost see the perspiration dripping from the show: They made Reese blonde again! There is singing and dancing! Don't you like Hasan Minhaj? Staffing TMS is, as it was in the first season, the opening crisis. Bradley and Eric haven't been getting great ratings, and now Eric is set to be plucked from TMS and given that plum evening anchor job that's about to open up. Bradley needs a new partner. A Memo From The Department Of What's More Fun Than Examining The Org Chart?: It's worth noting that there's a new arrangement of bosses: Cory is still the head of news, new cast member Stella (Greta Lee) is under him, Mia is the new Chip (the show executive producer), and Chip is gone, off getting engaged to Chip's Girlfriend — we'll be catching up with him later. Cory suggests they get Alex back, but Stella wants to be allowed to explore possible co-anchors for Bradley who are not white women — in fact, it seems she would like to explore dumping Bradley and starting from scratch. This is a non-starter for Cory, who has always had a warm relationship with Bradley that seems to have further warmed since Alex left. So Cory is letting Stella negotiate with the new co-host she wants while sneaking around to undermine her by begging Alex to come back. And just where is Alex? Well, she had a big rush of ""what a feminist icon!"" publicity after speaking out about UBA, which you can tell from all the magazine covers about herself that she has spread out on a table in her home, which seems super normal, not weird at all, no sir. But she's now retreated to Maine. She's been writing her memoir (of course), and she lives in a picturesque house and splits her own wood, which is perhaps the most Cher-Horowitz-ian ""AS IF!"" moment of the episode. In effect, Alex is starring in her own revival of the Diane Keaton classic Baby Boom, minus the baby and the hot veterinarian. A Memo From The Department Of Author Veracity: It's a shame that nobody ever really shows what it looks like when you're writing a book, but I guess Jennifer Aniston probably wants to be seen with her hair washed and even Apple doesn't have the budget for that many Diet Coke cans. When Cory shows up to beg Alex to return temporarily to TMS as part of a big deal with the network that would ultimately lead to a lot of other ... feminist icon projects? ... she says no. She doesn't want to come back. But then Alex hits up her neighbor's New Year's Eve party and runs into a psychic played by Kathy Najimy, who intuits that she feels sad and guilty — after whiffing on the basics by intuiting that Alex's parents are dead and she has a son. Now, one could ask why Alex would keep listening to a psychic who is unable to distinguish the dead from the living, and one could also suspect Kathy Najimy The Psychic of concluding Alex feels sad and guilty based on all those magazine articles about her. As it turns out, however, Alex is sad and guilty. Also, Maine is cold and she has no friends and she is probably very tired of splitting her own wood (AS IF!). So she calls Cory just as the ball is about to drop in Times Square, and she agrees to come back to UBA. Delighted, Cory kneecaps Stella by telling her that the deal she's been busy negotiating is off, and hey, it's going to be two white women at the anchor desk after all! Cory is in a state of weasel bliss about his successful end run around Stella, until he looks up at a news ticker and sees that Hannah's parents — you remember Hannah (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who may have intentionally taken her own life after the network failed her six or eight times regarding Mitch's sexual harassment — are suing UBA for wrongful death. Kathy Najimy plays a psychic who gets into the head of Alex (Jennifer Aniston) — eventually.  Oh, and as Cory stares miserably at that news? Somebody sneezes. New York City is now two months away from its first confirmed COVID case. Achoo! Here's the question that hangs over this entire first episode: Why are we here? Not here watching this show — people watch things that are much worse than this with many fewer bright spots. What I mean is, who on this planet thought it would be a great idea to spend an entire season of this show reliving the onset of COVID? It's some kind of weird apocalyptic nostalgia thing, like ... hey, remember realizing how bad it was? Remember being sent home from work if you were lucky? Remember new ring lights and hand-washing demos? Get ready to think about that stuff a lot more! Maybe Alex and Bradley can interview Tiger King! At first, it seems weird, but honestly, it's very sad. I suspect that they conceived this season when it was clear that a vaccine was in sight, and they thought that by September 2021 when the season dropped, things would be going well. They thought we'd be doing better than we are. They thought we'd be feeling more ready to process it. Instead, this season is landing at what is, for a lot of people, not the most dangerous moment in this pandemic but certainly the most infuriating. So an invitation to look back on January through March of 2020 is like an invitation to a person who just got hit in the face with a tennis ball to look at an instant replay of being hit with that ball while also trying to avoid another ball. So I want to talk about this show this season, even if you're not watching all of it. I want to talk about how they're using celebrity, how they're trying to capture shreds of the zeitgeist, why Steve Carell is still part of the show (he is!), and whether they have anything left to say about media or the #MeToo movement. But I also want to talk about how they shoot and light these people, how they dress them and do their hair, what music they use, and how they structure stories. Because in all its messiness, The Morning Show is a story about what television looks like at the moment.

,,"‘The Morning Show’: Season 1 Was Great, Season 2 Is Even Better","Jennifer Aniston, Billy Crudup and Reese Witherspoon in 'The Morning Show' on Apple TV+. When The Morning Show first premiered on Apple TV+ in 2019 some of the initial reviews were less than kind. Those negative takes were a bit presumptuous at the time as critics were only given the first three episodes to binge. The 10-episode season would go on to nab eight Emmy award nominations and one win. As superb as the first season was, season two is even better. “The first season was about the Me Too movement and the repercussions of that,” said executive producer and director Mimi Leder in a phone interview. “We used last season to turn over the rocks and see all the worms.” Leder, who is well known for the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic On the Basis of Sex, has directed seven of the show's 20 episodes including both season finales. We briefly talked about the latest and stunning statistic that one in every 500 U.S. residents has died of Covid-19 which brings to mind another of her hits, The Leftovers. That series was about life after 2% of the global population disappeared following a tragic and unexplained event. PROMOTED Life was very different during the filming of season one which left fans with quite the cliffhanger. Jennifer Aniston’s Alex Levy and Reese Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson are co-anchors of the top morning show and they start a revolution when they go live on the air to expose the toxic culture and sexual misconduct on their own show. The result is that many of their colleagues are left jobless and the network is hanging by a thread. It was early 2020 when production began for the 10-episode second season and then the pandemic hit. “We had been shooting for 13 days. It was mid-February through early March,” recalls Leder. “It was very frightening to be filming at the time. We were all just learning about social distancing. No one knew what was happening. We were the first production to shut down. We felt a real responsibility to keep the crew and cast safe.” And, adds Leder, the scripts for the second season had already been written. “We threw them all away and we had to really re-evaluate the stories we wanted to tell.” The pandemic was incorporated into the new scripts and like real life back then, the characters would have to learn how to live in this new normal. Forbes Daily: Get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.    Jennifer Aniston in 'The Morning Show' on Apple TV+. “This season is all about identity and asking the tough questions,” she explains. “There was this tidal wave of Covid coming upon us and no one knew how to handle it at first. This season, our characters are just learning what is happening around them.” But the new episodes are not solely about the pandemic. “This season is also about cancel culture, sexuality and race,” adds Leder. Production resumed at the end of October 2020 and filming went through May 15 of this year. “Our experience figuring things out is mirrored in the show. As the new season begins, Alex and Bradley and the team are just seeing the early headlines.” As in real life, the characters on the show are about to be deeply impacted by Covid-19. “One thing the pandemic did was force us to ask ourselves a lot of tough questions. Who are we? Every one of these characters this season has to ask themselves who they are and if they’re a good person. There’s a lot of self-examination and self-preservation this season with all of our characters and they’re going on this journey together and Covid lingers in the background like a storm cloud.” Leder does see a silver lining. “We also learned that what we do as individuals impacts those around us. The pandemic taught us a lot. It’s been a real time of reflection.” This new season also sees some new characters arrive including Julianna Margulies' Laura Peterson, a famous TV journalist in her own right who comes in and really shakes things up. There has been a lot of speculation around Steve Carell's character, Mitch Kessler, who was Alex’s original co-anchor. It was his inappropriate workplace behavior that set everything in motion. When asked if Mitch is based on Matt Lauer, Leder confirms he is not. “Let’s just say he’s an amalgamation of many people. His character represents a particular kind of man. I should probably stop there.” Reese Witherspoon in 'The Morning Show' on Apple TV+. Leder, like Aniston and Witherspoon, went behind-the-scenes at Good Morning America and The Today Show to study what goes into reporting the day’s news. “It’s really fascinating to see what it takes to get in front of the camera day in and day out to report the news and to have to do so even if your personal life is shattered.” And Alex and Bradley’s lives are certainly in turmoil this season. “Life for our characters is very complicated and in many ways, each is completely broken. Alex, for example, has done some things that cannot be undone. She’s hit rock bottom and she has to find a way to survive.” Season two of ‘The Morning Show’ premieres on Apple TV+ Friday, September 17. I watch a lot of TV series and interview the talent in front of and behind the camera. I also review shows but only the ones I like.

,,Jennifer Aniston returns to the set of ‘The Morning Show’,"   Alex Levy is back in action. On Tuesday, Jennifer Aniston was spotted on the set of “The Morning Show” in Los Angeles, which recently began production on Season 2. Bundled up in a beige coat, Aniston, 51, was photographed checking her makeup in a mirror as crew members wore face masks as they stood nearby. Inspired by Brian Stelter’s “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV,” the “Morning Show” premiered last November on Apple TV+.  Aniston stars as TV anchor Levy, whose on-air colleague Mitch Kessler — played by Steve Carell — is axed in the wake of a sexual misconduct scandal. Reese Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson, a field reporter, is later brought into the “Morning Show” mix with Levy. Both Aniston and Witherspoon, 44, were nominated for Golden Globes for their performances. Aniston won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama.

,,Jennifer Aniston Reveals Her Steamy ‘Morning Show’ Sex Scene With Jon Hamm Didn’t Use An Intimacy Coordinator: “We Can Figure This One Out”,"                                                        The Morning Show turned up the heat in Season 3 with the introduction of Jon Hamm’s character, billionaire Paul Marks, who is meant to be Jennifer Aniston‘s love interest. During a recent interview with Variety, Aniston noted that they didn’t use an intimacy coordinator when they filmed their sex scenes together, even if the scenes appeared “more explicit” this season, as the outlet noted. Aniston said that she felt “protected” while working with director Mimi Leder present. “I never felt uncomfortable. Jon was such a gentleman, always — I mean every move, every cut, ‘You OK?'” she recalled. “It was also very choreographed. That’s the beauty of Mimi and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don’t prepare.” She continued, “They asked us if we wanted an intimacy coordinator. I’m from the olden days, so I was like, ‘What does that mean?’ They said, ‘Where someone asks you if you’re OK,’ and I’m like, ‘Please, this is awkward enough!’ We’re seasoned — we can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there.” She and Hamm have known each other for “a long, long time” since actor Paul Rudd introduced them to each other about 12 years ago. “That was fun. I’ve known the Hammanator for a long, long time,” she said. Aniston also spoke on her character’s poor track record of romantic interests. “It’s hard to be a really successful woman and make that part of your life — it’s sort of the last thing on your to-do list. You’re busy doing so many other things in the world, which is why I think I failed so terribly at marriage —,” she said, before her Morning Show co-star Reese Witherspoon interjected to clarify that Aniston was talking about her marriage “in the show.” Aniston continued, “Everything I’ve gone through in my life, there’s not one thing I would do over, at all. It’s all our journey.” The Morning Show has already been renewed for a fourth season, though a release date has not been announced yet.

,,"Apple’s The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston, looks dour and joyless in its first trailer","FILED UNDER: The Apple TV+ exclusive will pit Aniston against Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in a battle for the anchor chair. It’s been months since Apple discussed what to expect from Apple TV+, its forthcoming entry into the premium streaming service Thunderdome. Now, with an apparent fall launch nearing (although no release date has yet been announced), the company has given us something more to chew on than just a laundry list of celebs — from Big Bird to Steven Spielberg to Oprah Winfrey — it plans to work with on its original programming: a full trailer for The Morning Show, which wrangles a cast of award winners for an adult take on the world of talk show television. Reese Witherspoon both executive produces and co-stars in this drama, which is styled like you’d expect any prestige drama to be. There’s Reese in a lingering close-up; there’s her onscreen foil (and offscreen co-star/co-producer) Jennifer Aniston, staring warily at herself in the mirror. Steve Carell, who stars as Aniston’s disgraced, bitter nemesis of sorts, is introduced in a cold-toned living room, like a jail cell, screaming in anguish. Carell has just lost his job as Aniston’s co-anchor on the titular Morning Show, a nationally beloved talk TV show à la the Today show, Good Morning America, etc. From the moment Aniston breaks the news of a scandal on air, things start spiraling out of control. It’s unclear what said scandal is, but the setup does immediately call to mind Matt Lauer, whose 20-year tenure as Today host ended in 2017 due to sexual harassment allegations. It’s difficult not to assume the show centers on the fallout of a #MeToo moment for Aniston — who, at least in the scenes in the trailer, can’t seem to keep her head above water as her producers come down harder on her while she tries to fend off suspicions that she has told a career-ending lie. Meanwhile, Witherspoon seems to be gunning for Carell’s open anchor chair ... while Carell fights to return to it. It all looks very dour, much unlike the façade that a typical morning show projects onscreen. Do we need another melancholy drama about the media in a landscape post-The Newsroom, Aaron Sorkin’s similarly joyless HBO series? Should we trust Apple to potentially take on a #MeToo fallout storyline in its first show out of the original programming gate? Apple seems to think so, but only time will tell.

,,"The Full Report on 'The Morning Show' Season 3: Release Date, Cast, Spoilers and More News","The Apple TV+ drama is coming back with Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Since its debut in 2019, Apple TV+'s The Morning Show has shocked and wowed viewers with its fictional take on the cutthroat business of daytime TV. Starring A-listers like Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, the first season quickly captivated fans, scoring an impressive eight Emmy nominations and one win in 2020. The second chapter of The Morning Show came out in September 2021 and once again exceeded expectations. The show continued to astonish audiences, earning three more Emmy nods this year. So, what's happening with The Morning Show season 3? We've got the full scoop on what a third season of the breakfast news program drama could look like. Here's everything we know so far about The Morning Show season 3: Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson are staying on the air: The Morning Show was officially renewed for season 3 in January. While no premiere date was announced just yet, it's likely that season 3 will be released on Apple TV+ sometime in the fall of 2022. Season 1 was released in November 2019, while COVID-19 delays pushed back the original season 2 premiere date almost by an entire year. The second season finally hit the streaming platform on September 2021 and it wrapped up in November. At the moment, few details are known about the next chapter of the series. That said, it's a pretty safe bet that the following cast members will return in some capacity, including: As for cast members who may be up in the air, some outlets are predicting that we won't be seeing Steve Carell's character, Mitch, anymore after what happened to him in season 2. But who knows, maybe we'll see the former anchor in flashbacks. Meanwhile, Radio Times guessed that Bel Powley (a.k.a. Claire) might not be around as much either, considering her reduced role in season 2. Again though, we just have to wait for more info to come out before we can be sure. With old characters returning, we will also be ushering in a whole new set of characters. Deadline announced Mad Men star Jon Hamm will join the cast as Paul Marks, "" a corporate titan who sets his sights on UBA."" His character will be directly involved with Cory, Alex and Bradley. What's more, actor Tig Notaro will come aboard as Amanda Robinson, Paul's chief of staff and will probably have to run interference for him in some capacity. In addition, Deadline reported in September that The Dropout star Stephen Fry will play Leonard Cromwell, a UBA board member who is attempting to get the company out of financial stress. Actress Nicole Beharie is also joining as a new lead alongside Jennifer and Reese's characters. She will portray Christina Hunter, a millennial who is an up-and-coming anchor on The Morning Show. She may be grounded, but she has a competitive edge to her which may surprise viewers. So, how is the cast taking to the news of more actors joining The Morning Show? According to Reese, they're thrilled to see them on-screen. ""I might have gotten a lot of phone calls from my friends when they announced Jon Hamm,"" she said during a FYC event in August. ""He is a very complex character. He’s a media mogul and he gives Billy Crudup a run for his money, which I think is the most fun part too, because Billy could eat a scene like I’ve never seen somebody eat a scene, and Hamm gets to come in and give him a great foil."" In November 2021, former showrunner Kerry Ehrin dropped a few hints to Deadline about potential storylines that could be explored in season 3. Among the details shared, the executive producer declared that she thinks there will be a time jump for the next installment. She also believes the season could mark a big turning point for Alex. ""I definitely want to see more of Bradley and Laura,"" Kerry explained to the outlet. ""I feel like Alex has come to a place for the first time since the pilot of accepting who she is and facing her worst fears, and I want to see how the phoenix rises from the ashes for her and learning how to have a full life and be present and loving."" Kerry also said she's ""curious"" about where the fate of UBA is going and teased that she loves focusing on the Cory-Stella relationship. ""I think they are a great story about sort of the transition of the old world and the new world, and I think they’re both just such rich characters, and I’m excited to see how they develop."" Jennifer also spoke out about her hopes for season 3 and she'd love to see her character experience romance. ""I think it’s time to see Alex find some love and some passion,"" she told Variety in June. ""She could put the controls down and go into the vulnerability of opening up her heart, which I don’t think she’s ever really quite done."" As far as other elements, she didn't reveal many details about what fans could expect. But she did shed light on a broader theme the entire cast will be embarking on this time around. ""I can’t say much. It’s a great opportunity to be able to shine a light on areas that are very frustrating and a fear of where we’re going as a society,"" she continued to the outlet. ""We try to shed some sort of light on it, and comment on it a little bit. It’s a deep well at this point."" Lastly, and big spoiler if you haven't seen season 2, Kerry revealed that there might be a chance Paola Lambruschini (Valerina Golino)'s footage of Mitch before his death will resurface down the road. But these storylines are not set in stone. In January of this year, Deadline reported that Kerry stepped down as showrunner, a role she's held for seasons 1 and 2, and Charlotte Stoudt is taking over. Kerry will stay on as a consultant for season 3. According to Reese, yes! The actress shared a first look at production for season 3 in mid-August, all while in costume and standing on set for the first time this year. ""We are backkkkkkkk! 🎬 ✨,"" she wrote at the time. ""@TheMorningShow Season 3!"" She wasn't the only one pumped to get back to filming. The show's official Instagram posted its own photo from the set, asking viewers to come up with their own theories of what will happen in the new season. ""…and so it begins. 🎬,"" the caption read. ""Drop your #TheMorningShow Season 3 predictions below ⬇️."" The Morning Show season 3 will be available to stream exclusively on Apple TV+. The first two seasons are also exclusively available on the platform. For those who don't have an Apple TV+ account, you can try out the streaming service via a free seven-day trial. After that, a subscription to Apple TV+ costs $4.99 a month. Apple TV+ is compatible with select Apple devices, smart TVs, gaming consoles and streaming devices.

,,The Morning Show Exclusive: Watch Jennifer Aniston Face Off Against an Icy Journalist,"  BY LAURA BRADLEY Jennifer Aniston is easily the most delightful part of The Morning Show. The Apple series is Aniston’s first real return to television since Friends, but Aniston’s Morning Show character, Alex Levy, is a far cry from the bubbly, naïve Rachel Green. As viewers have witnessed throughout the season, Alex knew a lot more than she’s let on to the public regarding her coanchor Mitch Kessler’s (Steve Carell) bad behavior. And although she seems to have the public fooled, a few people within her orbit are onto her—most notably, her new coanchor, Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), and the seasoned journalist Maggie, played by a wonderful and icy Marcia Gay Harden. The dynamic between Alex and Maggie is deliciously fraught, as seen in this exclusive clip from this week’s episode. Both women have run in New York media circles for a long time—and in doing so they’ve also been circling each other. And although Alex has her game face on and her script memorized in the hopes of swaying Maggie to believe her as a victim of Mitch’s horrifying behavior, it appears Maggie is buying none of it. “I know what the show needs,” Alex tells Maggie in the clip. “A fast, fresh start. Feminist slant. And it couldn’t happen faster in my opinion.” As the two discuss Maggie’s upcoming profile of Bradley, it’s clear Alex wants a share of the spotlight for herself, even going so far as to insert herself into the story of how their show’s landmark interview came together—despite the reality that she was livid with Bradley’s approach. “It’s never straightforward when women try to take control of a male-dominated empire, you know?” Alex says. “But we made history with that interview.” Maggie’s response? “You’re already a royal we? That’s cute.” And that’s when the tables turn. Although Maggie says she has “tremendous respect” for Alex after their years of acquaintance, she also insists, “I am not going to write some feminist puff piece about a woman who turned a blind eye to the sexual misconduct of her cohost.... Bradley’s profile is gonna be great. I don’t blame you for being worried about getting lost.” Looks like Alex needs to try another angle. — Our cover story: John Legend and Chrissy Teigen on love and resistance in the age of Trump

,,"Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon tease 'The Morning Show' season 2","""The Morning Show"" season 2 premieres Friday, Sept. 17, on Apple TV+. After a nearly two-year wait, ""The Morning Show"" is back for season 2. For those who need a refresher, season 1 followed Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston), the anchor of a fictional morning news and talk show who is sent reeling after her on-air partner of 15 years, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) is fired after being accused of sexual misconduct. While trying to weather the storm and keep her job, Alex brings on an opinionated and impulsive reporter named Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) to be her new co-host. The first season ended -- spoiler alert -- with Alex and Bradley calling out their network and its president on-air for covering up Kessler's actions and fostering a toxic workplace environment and, just as Bradley is encouraging others to come forward and speak out, the feed to ""The Morning Show"" is cut off. ""At the very end of season 1, the entire network is shut down,"" Witherspoon, 45, told ""Good Morning America"" of the aftermath from last season. ""Everything is rearranged and you pick up right there at the beginning of season 2. So you'll see exactly who got hired, who got fired. There is a whole new cast of characters."" Reese Witherspoon talks about season 2 of 'The Morning Show' New additions to the show for season 2 are Julianna Margulies, Greta Lee and Hasan Minhaj, among others. Many familiar faces from season 1 will also return. ""The reception was wonderful and we also went into territories of the issues that were a little, you know, taboo,"" Aniston, 52, told ""GMA"" of the show having tackled #MeToo. If that wasn't enough, this season the show is poised to tackle issues of race, ethnicity, discrimination, mental health, cancel culture and more. Some of these matters have already been touched upon, but the second season will target them more directly. The COVID-19 pandemic will also be incorporated into season 2. ""We have the opportunity to have the conversations that people are having behind closed doors that people would never ever dare say in a public place, 'cause they'd be canceled,"" Aniston said.

Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom. “Lessons in Chemistry” Set in the early 1950s, “Lessons in Chemistry” follows Elizabeth Zott (played by Larson), whose dream of being a scientist is put on hold in a patriarchal society. When Elizabeth finds herself fired from her lab, she accepts a job as a host on a TV cooking show, and sets out to teach a nation of overlooked housewives — and the men who are suddenly listening — a lot more than recipes. “Shrinking” Starring Jason Segel and Harrison Ford in one of this first television roles, “Shrinking” follows grieving therapist Jimmy (played by Segel) who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he finds himself making huge, tumultuous changes to people’s lives … including his own. “Ted Lasso” Jason Sudeikis plays Ted Lasso, a small-time college football coach from Kansas hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience coaching soccer. In addition to starring, Sudeikis serves as executive producer, alongside Bill Lawrence (“Scrubs”) via his Doozer Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television and Universal Television, a division of NBCUniversal Content. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive producer with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Joe Kelly and Brendan Hunt, and is based on the pre-existing format and characters from NBC Sports. “Truth Be Told” From acclaimed writer, showrunner and executive producer Nichelle Tramble Spellman, “Truth Be Told” is an NAACP Image Award-winning drama that offers a unique glimpse into America’s obsession with true crime podcasts and challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage. In season three, Poppy (Octavia Spencer), frustrated by the lack of media attention for several young missing Black girls, teams with an unorthodox principal (Gabrielle Union) to keep the victims' names in the public eye while chasing down leads to a suspected sex trafficking ring that may have ensnared them. “The Crowded Room” Starring and executive produced by Tom Holland, “The Crowded Room” is a gripping, 10-episode limited series that stars Holland as Danny Sullivan, a man who is arrested following his involvement in a shooting in New York City in 1979. A captivating thriller told through a series of interviews with curious interrogator Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried), Danny’s life story unfolds, revealing elements of the mysterious past that shaped him, and the twists and turns that will lead him to a life-altering revelation.

Kerry, Mimi and Michael, and the teams at Media Res, Hello Sunshine and Echo Films, have created an irresistible world that is equally delicious and provocative.” The complete first and second seasons of “Morning Wars” are now streaming globally on Apple TV+. Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two found “The Morning Show” team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley’s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play. Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, the star-studded cast includes Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Bel Powley, Desean Terry, Janina Gavankar, Tom Irwin and Marcia Gay Harden, as well as new additions for season two Greta Lee, Ruairi O’Connor, Hasan Minhaj, Holland Taylor, Tara Karsian as news producer Gayle Burns, Valeria Golino and Julianna Margulies. Developed by Ehrin, who will serve as consultant on season three of “Morning Wars,” the series is executive produced by Michael Ellenberg through Media Res, which also serves as the studio, along with Aniston and Kristin Hahn through Echo Films; Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter through Hello Sunshine. Leder also serves as executive producer. In its first season, Crudup’s performance as Corey Ellison earned an Emmy win in the Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category, in addition to a Critics Choice Award. Aniston's powerful performance as Alex Levy earned a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. The series also received nominations from the Television Critics Association for Outstanding New Program and a TV Choice Award for Best New Drama.
