,,Fake Biden Robo-Call Tells New Hampshire Voters To Stay Home,"Print As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robo-call is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home - using a fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden. ""It’s important that you save your vote for the November election….voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says. The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is investigating what he called an apparent ""unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters."" ""The Election Law Unit’s investigation is ongoing,"" he said. The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden's name on their ballots. Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was ""disinformation"" and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden's write-in campaign will be closely-watched amid weak polls for the 81-year-old president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party's nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden's name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire's historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden ""voice"" is heard using one of his signature phrases, ""What a bunch of malarkey."" The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair. Sullivan called the robo-call an attempt at election interference, and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated. In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday night. ""Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire primary,"" she said. She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number without her permission. The explosion of generative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - in recent months has spurred both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and even possibly overpower humans. The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was ""absolutely not"" involved in the robo-call. The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not involved. The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a reporter on Sunday night. ""Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing,"" the Phillips campaign said.

,,Fake Joe Biden robocall tells New Hampshire Democrats not to vote Tuesday,"        MANCHESTER, N.H. — The New Hampshire attorney general's office says it is investigating what appears to be an ""unlawful attempt"" at voter suppression after NBC News reported on a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden that told recipients not to vote in Tuesday's presidential primary. ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. ""These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely."" The investigation comes after a prominent New Hampshire Democrat, whose personal cellphone number showed up on the caller ID screens of those receiving the call, filed a complaint. “What a bunch of malarkey,” the robocall phone message begins, echoing a favorite term Biden has uttered before. The message says that “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election.” “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” it says. The message concludes with a phone number belonging to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair who now runs a super PAC supporting the campaign to urge New Hampshire Democrats to write in Biden’s name in the primary.  If you received this robocall or have more information on it, contact NBC News here. Biden’s name does not appear on Tuesday’s ballot, a consequence of state elections officials' setting the date of the primary before South Carolina’s on Feb. 3, the first sanctioned contest of the 2024 nominating race under new Democratic National Committee rules. But local supporters launched the late write-in effort to both marshal support for Biden and send a message to the national party about New Hampshire’s coveted, centurylong tradition of holding the nation’s first primary. In an interview, Sullivan said she began receiving calls Sunday evening from those who had received the message. A woman she spoke to told her that Biden had called her, though she said she was not a Biden supporter. “I said, ‘You got a call from Joe Biden, and he gave you my number?’” Sullivan said she responded. A volunteer for the write-in effort also received the call and recorded it, Sullivan said, and shared it with organizers of the Biden write-in campaign. One of the organizers then shared it with NBC News. It’s not clear how many voters received the call or what types of voters were targeted. Lists of voters’ phone numbers can be readily purchased from data brokers. And Sullivan said that while it is not clear who is behind the robocall, “it’s obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden.” “I want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible, because this is an attack on democracy,” said Sullivan, an attorney, who said she believes the call could violate several laws. “I’m not going to let it go. I want to know who’s paying for it. Who knew about it? Who benefits?” She said she also plans to engage with federal law enforcement. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said that ""the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately."" Sullivan was party chair in 2002, when a so-called phone-jamming effort was carried out during a hotly contested U.S. Senate race. Two Republican officials, including the executive director of the state Republican Party and a Republican National Committee operative, were convicted of using computer-generated phone calls to disrupt Democrats’ get-out-the-vote call center operations.   State officials are speaking out against the calls. Secretary of State David Scanlan said the calls “reinforce a national concern about the effect of artificial intelligence on campaigns.” Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said she hopes the attempt to dampen turnout for Biden will backfire. ""I urge Granite Staters to make sure their friends and neighbors know the truth and turn out in even bigger numbers to write in President Biden’s name,"" she said. The campaign of Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is challenging Biden for the nomination, said it was not aware of the calls but called them “wildly concerning.” “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” spokesperson Katie Dolan said. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.” A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign denied any connection to the calls, saying, “Not us. We have nothing to do with it.” Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior politics reporter for NBC News. Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent.

,,,"2020 ELECTIONS The ex-veep has work to do to win over Bernie’s base. Four in five of Bernie Sanders&#39; backers in Michigan said they&#39;d be dissatisfied with Joe Biden as the Democratic standard bearer. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo 03/13/2020 04:30 AM EDT  On Tuesday night, Joe Biden’s campaign was celebrating his latest primary night triumph. There’s no question it’s been a banner two weeks for Biden. But lurking in the background of his sudden ascension to all-but-presumptive nominee is evidence that at least some Bernie Sanders supporters might not migrate to him in November, weakening him in the general election. The significance of the problem became apparent in the same string of primaries that put Biden on the cusp of the nomination. In Michigan — a state critical to Democrats’ efforts to reclaim their general election footing in the Rust Belt — just 2 of 5 Sanders backers said they would vote Democratic in November, regardless of who became the nominee, according to exit polls. Four in five said they’d be dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic standard-bearer. Though it’s unclear how widespread or adamant the #NeverBiden contingent is — will they really stay home when the alternative is another four years of President Donald Trump? — the misgivings at least put the Biden campaign on notice that it has significant work to do to bring along Sanders’ base. There is certainly anecdotal evidence that for many progressives, Biden represents everything they dislike about mainstream Democratic politics. On “The Young Turks,” which draws millions of viewers, Krystal Ball, the former MSNBC host, said she couldn’t vote for Trump.       “But you can leave it blank,” she said, referring to the November ballot. Ball said she is an “undecided voter” because “if they always can say, ‘Look, you’ve got to vote for us no matter what, you’ve got no other choice,’ then they’re always going to treat us like this.” Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster who worked on the presidential campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Howard Dean, said that in their overtures to Sanders’ supporters, Democrats have “time, Trump and hopefully Bernie himself on our side.” However, he said, “It’s a huge challenge.” The November election is almost eight months away, and unlike in 2016, Sanders’ supporters don’t have the hard feelings of superdelegates — the party bigwigs who clinched the nomination for Hillary Clinton — to overcome. This year, Sanders’ momentum was blunted not by those insiders but by black voters in the South and, following his victory in South Carolina, by the broader electorate. Polls show Biden is also viewed more favorably now than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. “At the end of the day, it’s Biden or Trump,” said Boyd Brown, a former South Carolina lawmaker and former Democratic National Committee member. “They’ll turn out.” Still, some Sanders supporters see the consolidation of moderate presidential candidates and other elected officials around Biden as the establishment asserting its power over the grassroots. Trump has happily stoked the divide, declaring that the Democratic primary is “rigged” against Sanders, just as he did four years ago. “The rationale for us is that our votes need to be earned and that we’ve been taken for granted, and the party never moves to us,” said Alyson Metzger, a 54-year-old writer and progressive activist in New York City who supports Sanders. “If they install Joe Biden, I will not vote for Biden. … This is not democratic what’s happening in the Democratic primary.” For Metzger, not voting for Biden is a matter of conscience. For others, it is also strategy. On “Never Biden” Facebook pages and in Twitter threads, some activists argue that if Trump is reelected, Democrats will fare better in the next midterms and that the party will be more likely to nominate a progressive in 2024. If Biden is elected, they see eight years of centrist governance.  “I can’t vote for Joe Biden,” said Bryan Quinby, a left-wing podcaster in Ohio, saying that “it feels like the party doesn’t want us — the people who were pushing for Bernie Sanders and were enthusiastic about it.” Noting that his vote was “never guaranteed for the Democrats,” he said that in November, “I think it just means I don’t vote for president.” Of particular concern for Biden are young voters, including Latinos — the segments of the electorate that Sanders carried by a large margin. Evan Weber, national political director of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young climate change activists, said it is a “real possibility” that young liberals will stay home in November. While stressing that he would vote for any Democratic nominee, Weber argued, “There’s lots of narratives about why Hillary Clinton lost the election, but one undeniable one is that she did not mobilize the young people who turned out for Obama in 2012 and especially 2008. We hear a lot from pundits about Joe Biden being Obama’s vice president and him being able to recreate the Obama coalition, but one of the core and critical components of the coalition was young people.” Exit polls from this year’s primaries have found a stark age divide between Sanders and Biden supporters. In Michigan, almost two-thirds of voters under 45 backed Sanders, while Biden captured a third of them. It was even more lopsided among voters under 30: 4 in 5 voted for Sanders. But Sanders has failed to turn young people out at rates he’d hoped, and among those over 45, Biden won two-thirds and Sanders 1 in 4. Sanders, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, reiterated that Trump “must be defeated” and that he “will do everything in my power to make that happen,” even as he vowed to press ahead in the nominating contest. But while acknowledging Biden’s expanding lead in the primary, he warned, “You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said Biden needs to make building a relationship with young voters “a central focus” of his campaign to beat Trump. Recent Democratic nominees who have lost, such as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, received about 55 percent of the youth vote, he said, whereas former President Barack Obama won 60 percent or more in his two races. “It’s not a coincidence that the youth vote crossed or met that 60 percent threshold in each of those campaigns that were successful,” he said. In the 2016 primary, Sanders dominated the youth vote against Clinton, winning more than 80 percent of voters under 30 in some states. When the general election came, some leading left-wing voices backed the Green Party’s Jill Stein. This cycle, Sanders has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would support the nominee, regardless of who it is. The consequence of even a portion of Sanders’ support evaporating instead of migrating to Biden could be significant in a close election against Trump. And the urgency for Biden to win over a constituency that Sanders has carried reliably has become plain in recent days. Biden on Tuesday night thanked Sanders and his supporters directly “for their tireless passion,” saying, “We share a common goal. And together, we’ll defeat Donald Trump.” The next day, his communications director, Kate Bedingfield, was on Fox News arguing that “there is a lot more that unites us than divides us.” “There is a whole lot about our message,” she said, “that appeals to Sanders voters.”  ",www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438,© 2024 POLITICO LLC
,,Biden tells voters 'you ain't black' if you're still deciding between him and Trump – video,"Joe Biden has been criticised after saying,'If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black'. The former vice-president made the comment in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show 'The Breakfast Club'. After a campaign aide said Biden had to wrap up the conversation, Charlamagne said: 'Listen, you’ve got to come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden. It’s a long way until November. We’ve got more questions.'  'You’ve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.' He said Charlamagne and voters should 'take a look at my record, man!' Fri 22 May 2020 17.23 BST

,,Fact check: A look at Biden’s first year in false claims,"When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been “arrested” in the context of the civil rights movement – even suggesting this had happened more than once – it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty. Biden’s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones. The President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures – sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point. Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year. So Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes. Here is a roundup of Biden’s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below. Biden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods – more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors – that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive. And like some of Trump’s tall tales about his past, Biden’s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain. While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, “I used to drive a tractor-trailer,” though only for “part of a summer.” This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, “I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,” adding, “I got to.” There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it). Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled “17,000 miles” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct. Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.) And Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community. The 7 most important lines from Joe Biden's news conference At a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered “spending time at” and “going to” Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue’s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be “the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.” There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a “liaison” with a major adversary. Biden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation – further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public. In August, the President said, “What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?” Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn’t “gone” – as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan “never made any sense to me” – though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly. In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said “the law doesn’t allow” Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn’t true, given the administration’s authority to grant “parole,” and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn’t permitted. In December, Biden said in another interview that “I’ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.” While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start – as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign. The state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case. Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was “kind of back to what it was before the pandemic”; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure. To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody’s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth – wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs. Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody’s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase “longer-term” from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would “ease longer-term inflationary pressures” – leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today. Many of Biden’s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor’s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear. But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too. At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that “you’re not going to get Covid” if you’re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President’s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that “if you’re vaccinated, you’re not going to be hospitalized, you’re not going to be in the ICU unit and you’re not going to die”; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people. Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration’s work to get Americans vaccinated – misleadingly playing down the Trump administration’s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures. In February, Biden claimed that “suicides are up” amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were “over 800,000” vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000. When Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn’t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies – making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses. During Biden’s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration. And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans’ new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.

,,"Opinion: Biden says if you’re black and don’t vote for him, you’re not black. He’s right","When the popular black radio host Charlamagne tha God told Joe Biden at the end of a spirited but friendly interview that he needed to come back on his show because “We got more questions,” Biden shot back: “You got more questions. If you have a problem figuring out if you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” Good one, Joe. As ridiculous as it was to say that to a black radio and TV personality who, among other things, wrote a book he calls a “self-help guide for the hood,” here’s the thing: Biden was right. He just didn’t have the right to say it. As a political and social liberal — who is also black — I was dismayed that anyone, black or white, voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But I was particularly appalled when I saw anyone black campaign for him. The only person I gave a pass to was Omarosa Manigault Newman — because she, at least, truly had a business reason to vote for the guy who had made her famous on “The Apprentice” and could possibly get something out of his becoming president. And she did — she landed some vague White House job that she eventually quit before writing an unflattering memoir of her brief stint there. I would be the last black person to suggest that black Americans are a monolithic group who all believe the same things. When it comes to electing the president of the United States, all Americans should care about voting rights, social programs, truthfulness and candor from our leaders, the environment, the meting out of justice, diversity in government offices, and the makeup of the Supreme Court. (As resilient as she is, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot live forever.) But when voting rights are subverted, the safety net is attacked, environmental regulations abandoned and income inequality widened, the repercussions hit black people hardest. Charlamagne was right to remind Biden on his show, “The Breakfast Club,” that Democrats take black voters for granted. That’s true. The Democratic Party has a history of assuming: Who else will black people vote for? And the Republican Party often acts as if it lost black folks from the get-go. When Trump declared in 2016 at a political rally that black voters should choose him, asking them what did they have to lose, what had the Democratic Party done for them? I marveled, “Nice try.” But at the same time, it was preposterous. The New York Times documented a history of racial bias decades ago at rental properties owned by Trump and his father. Biden and the Democratic Party are a better choice than Trump and the Republican Party. It’s as simple and sometimes depressing as that. And not voting at all is dangerous. It only ups the possibility that Trump wins. Republicans vote, they don’t stay home. Even in a quarantine. Race and politics are so odd. President Clinton could possibly have gotten away with saying what Biden said because he was jokingly, affectionately, referred to as the first black president. Clinton seemed to genuinely bond with black folks — a result, I think, of his Southern roots and his effortless ability to bond with everyone, black, white, man, woman, child. And President Obama, precisely because he is black, could never have gotten away with saying what Biden said because suddenly he would look like a flaming militant. Biden’s willingness to speak outside the boundaries of political correctness is refreshing. When he yelled at a Detroit auto plant worker (and this was when he was still campaigning for the Michigan primary and needed votes) and refused to placate him on gun rights — “I’m not taking your gun away at all. You need 100 rounds?”— I thought, “Fantastic.” Finally, a candidate stands up to the gun-obsessed. But Biden went too far this time. And, within hours, he had apologized, saying he should not have been so cavalier. Charlamagne didn’t miss a beat when Biden said it. “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact I want something for my community,” he told Biden. Biden should go back on his show and respond to that.

,,"Biden plans to stay home, testing limits of virtual campaign","Bill Barrow, Associated Press Steve Peoples, Associated Press Joe Biden has no foreseeable plans to resume in-person campaigning amid a pandemic that is testing whether a national presidential election can be won by a candidate communicating almost entirely from home. The virtual campaign Biden is waging from Wilmington, Delaware, is a stark contrast with President Donald Trump, who is planning travel despite warnings from public health experts about the coronavirus’s spread. It also intensifies the spotlight on how Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will manage his campaign, with some in his party fretting that his still-developing virtual model isn’t reaching enough voters. For now, Biden and his aides are brushing back hand-wringing from Democrats and mockery from Republicans who argue that the 77-year-old is “hiding in his basement.” “Voters don’t give a s*** about where he’s filming from,” campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon told The Associated Press. “What they care about is what he’s saying and how we connect with them.” Biden was more diplomatic in assessing the situation on Tuesday. “The idea that somehow we are being hurt by my keeping to the rules and following the instructions that (have) been put forward by doctors is absolutely bizarre,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” O’Malley Dillon took the helm of Biden’s campaign in mid-March, just as coronavirus shutdowns commenced. She recently beefed up the campaign’s digital and finance teams and said she’ll unveil battleground state leadership in coming weeks. She also pointed to budding “partnerships” that include the national party’s battleground state program. But those moves haven’t prevented critiques from prominent Democrats, including the architects of President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, who question Biden’s digital savvy and capacity to build the national vote-by-mail effort that might be necessary to win during a pandemic. Obama allies David Plouffe and David Axelrod wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Biden’s home studios resemble “an astronaut beaming back to earth from the International Space Station.” They encouraged Biden to make wider use of platforms from Facebook and Twitter to Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. In a similar piece, Lis Smith, media strategist behind Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign, touted the virtues of local-market media and using celebrities more on other platforms. Yvette Simpson, who leads the progressive group Democracy for America, said she’s “very concerned” she cannot see “how we’re going to engage people.” She said the campaign has squandered time since Biden took command of the primary in early March. News Wrap: Biden blasts Trump’s handling of COVID-19 pandemic House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a close Biden friend whose endorsement helped spur his run of primary victories, said he’s “very worried” about Democrats building a voter turnout operation that balances in-person voting with absentee balloting. Clyburn, however, emphasized that it’s not Biden’s place to worry over the details. “His job is to be the candidate,” Clyburn said. To some degree, the naysaying reflects Democrats’ desperation to beat Trump – who holds a clear early lead in fundraising and organizing – and the reality that Biden emerged from a haphazard primary campaign and must now play catch-up. Tara McGowan, founder and CEO of the Democrat-aligned digital firm ACRONYM, credited the campaign with making progress. “You can’t just snap your fingers and create an entirely different culture in their campaign,” she said. Clyburn argued there’s been a turnaround, especially in fundraising. “Winning is a great tonic,” he said. Biden raised $46.7 million in March, and in April he combined with the Democratic National Committee to raise $60.5 million. Trump and the Republican National Committee have far outraised Democrats this cycle, and they have more than $250 million cash on hand, but Biden’s April total nearly pulled even with Trump’s monthly total of $61.7 million. Erskine Bowles, one of Biden’s fundraisers and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, said the question isn’t whether Biden will catch Trump in total fundraising – he won’t – but whether he will have the resources to build a winning campaign. “People are giving to make sure he does,” Bowles said. From inside the campaign, the outside worries seem as much about timing and perception as about reality: The April and May fundraising windfall is just now being put into hiring. Biden has ramped up his social media presence, including a recent Instagram appearance with soccer star Megan Rapinoe and an economic speech on NowThis, a digital news medium targeting younger voters. O’Malley Dillon said she has “zero concern that we’re not at pace.” Critics, Biden allies say, also gloss over how Biden’s core pitch – touting his experience and empathy, making a moral and competence case against Trump, and promising to “rebuild the middle class” – won over Democratic primary voters even before the coronavirus upended daily life. Now, Biden’s argument against Trump is sharpened but stems from the same roots, with recent polling suggesting it’s reaching voters. “Joe’s got the right message,” Clyburn said. Indeed, days before his co-signed critique was published, Plouffe appeared at a Biden fundraiser that pulled in more than $1 million. On that call, Plouffe agreed with O’Malley Dillon that Trump’s turbulent presidency alongside Biden’s candidacy means “an expanded map” of battleground states. Trump is answering with a daunting reelection behemoth. On a call with reporters Tuesday, the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, called it the “largest field and data program” in GOP campaign history. And while O’Malley Dillon has spent two months building a general election campaign in a new digital environment, Brad Parscale has long been established in his role as Trump’s campaign manager. The Trump campaign hasn’t had to worry about money, with the president pulling in more than $700 million so far this cycle. “The Trump campaign never skipped a beat” when the emphasis shifted to digital, Lara Trump said. And now the president wants to return to a conventional travel schedule. He travels next on Thursday to Pennsylvania, and aides say he wants to travel at least once a week. Biden, meanwhile, is “anxious to go out and campaign” but is staying home “to set an example … with this health and economic crisis.” “This is not politics,” Biden said. “This is life.” Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Julie Pace and Will Weissert contributed from Washington.

,,Did Joe Biden really say that the 2022 election could be ‘illegitimate’?,"At Wednesday’s press conference, President Joe Biden was asked a simple question. It was this: “Speaking of voting rights legislation, if this isn’t passed, do you still believe the upcoming election will be fairly conducted and its results will be legitimate?” The easy answer – and the one Biden’s White House wishes he gave – goes something like this: “Yes, despite all of the Republicans’ attempts to limit who can vote and when, I ultimately have faith in the American political system’s ability to produce a free and fair election.” He didn’t say that. What he did say has ignited a debate about whether Biden believes that the 2022 election could well be illegitimate – so much so that White House press secretary Jen Psaki was forced to clarify via tweet on Thursday morning: “Lets be clear: @potus was not casting doubt on the legitimacy of the 2022 election.” In an attempt to clear all of this up, let’s go through what Biden actually said. First, here’s what Biden said in response to that first question about whether the 2022 results will be legitimate: “Well, it all depends on whether or not we’re able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election. … I think if, in fact – no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and – and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you’re going to see the people who they’re trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.” So, Biden appears to be answering two different questions here – neither of which are the one he was asked. In the first part of his answer, he is suggesting that the legitimacy (or not) of the election is tied to his (and his party’s) ability to make the case to the public about the restrictive voting rights measures passed in the wake of the 2020 election in places like Florida and Georgia. Then Biden pivots to say that, no matter what, minority voters will show up to vote in 2022, which has zero to do with the original question about whether the election might be illegitimate. Because of the questions that first answer raised, another reporter follows up with Biden. Here’s that exchange: Reporter: “A moment ago, you were asked whether or not you believed that we would have free and fair elections in 2022 if some of these state legislatures reformed their voting protocols. You said that it depends. Do you – do you think that they would in any way be illegitimate?” Biden: “Oh, yeah, I think it easily could be – be illegitimate. Imagine – imagine if, in fact, Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.” Reporter: “In regard to 2022, sir – the midterm elections.” Biden: “Oh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit. You have to recount it and we’re not going to count – we’re going to discard the following votes. I mean, sure, but – I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit. It’s – the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these – these reforms passed.” So, Biden is asked to clarify his view on 2022, but appears to misunderstand the question – answering instead about the possibility that the 2020 election could have been illegitimate. Biden’s line –“I think it easily could be – be illegitimate” – that is being quoted everywhere today is clearly a reference to 2020 as he follows it with “if…Trump had succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.” The reporter interjects to make sure Biden knows the question isn’t about the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Biden course corrects – “Oh, 2022” – then gives what is, at best, a confusing answer. He uses an odd phrasing – “I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit” – and then directly links the legitimacy of the 2022 election to getting major voting reform legislation passed at the federal level. Legislation, it’s worth noting, that has no chance of passing before the 2022 election. What, then, can we conclude? A few things: 1) Biden never said the 2022 election would be illegitimate. His quote about an election “easily” being illegitimate is quite clearly him referring to the 2020 race. 2) Biden never really answers the question he was asked in any sort of definitive way. 3) Biden ties passage of federal voting rights legislation to the likely legitimacy of the 2022 election. In short: Biden was vague and unclear at just the wrong moment. As the former president of the United States seeks to undermine faith in American elections, the current occupant of the White House needs to affirm free and fairness of the vote in the most blunt terms possible. Biden didn’t come close to doing that on Wednesday.   ",www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-midterm-election-voter-rights-legitimate/index.html,"© 2024 Cable News Network.

,,Inside a quiet effort to drive Black voters from Biden: From the Politics Desk,"        This is the digital version of From the Politics Desk, a daily newsletter covering the biggest stories in politics. Today's top story is from Ben Kamisar, plus analysis from Steve Kornacki. President Joe Biden could be facing a turnout problem in 2024. And an experimental stealth campaign during South Carolina’s Democratic primary highlights one way players in the Republican Party will be trying to exploit Biden’s weaknesses. A conservative group funded by anonymous donors sent mailers to approximately 75,000 Democratic primary voters in South Carolina, a heavily Black electorate, ahead of the Feb. 3 primary there, criticizing Biden over his administration’s push to ban menthol cigarettes. Black smokers are more likely to use menthol cigarettes, according to research cited by the FDA, and the potential ban has divided civil rights groups. Do you have a news tip for our politics team? Let us know Biden won the South Carolina primary overwhelmingly, with 96% support — but the bigger question is whether the mailer, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News, pushed recipients to stay home instead of turning out. That kind of result, or pushing voters to consider a third-party option, could have a much bigger effect in the fall in a close swing state. A source familiar with the strategy driving the group, Building America’s Future, told NBC News that while it’s still analyzing how the mailers affected recipients’ votes in the South Carolina primary, the nonprofit is planning to reinvest in a similar strategy later this year.  The group is planning to spend more than $1 million on efforts aimed at pushing base Democratic voters away from Biden in the general election, primarily in battleground states. It plans to target predominantly Black voters in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin with a mix of television, digital, radio and direct mail. But the group may also target young voters, too, as it did during golf’s WM Phoenix Open this month by focusing on concerns about potential bans on nicotine pouches like Zyn.  Read the full story here → As the primary calendar turns to Haley’s home state of South Carolina this Saturday, her campaign’s math problem isn’t going to get much easier to solve.  Polling puts her far behind Donald Trump in the state, with no indication that she’s made any new inroads with core Republican voters. This means that Haley’s hopes for an upset victory — which she probably needs to maintain any plausibility as a candidate — will rest on her ability to attract support from non-Republicans and to turn them out at levels never before seen in a South Carolina primary. To put her challenge in perspective, take a look at the breakdown of South Carolina GOP primary electorates this century (and note that the state doesn’t register voters by party, meaning that anyone can participate in the GOP contest and that the figures below reflect how voters identified their own partisan loyalties in past exit polls): As you can see, the share of self-identified Republicans has ranged from just over 60% to as high as 80%. By comparison, self-identified Republicans in the New Hampshire GOP primary last month accounted for barely 50% of the electorate. So, barring an unforeseen surge with these voters, Haley will probably need this number to plummet to an all-time low on Saturday, which would reduce the clout of a voting bloc that appears rather hostile to her.  This would require a corresponding spike in the share of independents and Democrats crossing over to support her. As the chart above shows, their combined share in South Carolina GOP primaries typically falls in the 20-30% range. The one exception came in 2000, when John McCain was running against George W. Bush and relying on a coalition that — like Haley’s — leaned heavily on non-Republican support. But that still wasn’t nearly enough for McCain, who lost the state by 11 points to Bush thanks to Bush’s overpowering support among core Republicans: And since 2000, there’s never been a split anywhere near as vast between Republicans and non-Republicans in terms of candidate support: Note that McCain in his 2008 bid is the only candidate to win South Carolina despite finishing second among self-identified Republicans. But his deficit among those voters was only a single point, allowing McCain to ride his strong independent support to an overall statewide victory. But with the enormous gaps Haley has faced with Republican voters, it’s the 2000 McCain model that her own effort resembles, not his 2008 one. And to do what McCain failed to do back in 2000 and actually capture the state, Haley will somehow need to expand the share of non-Republicans still further while also squeezing even more votes from them.

,,Remarks by President Biden on Protecting the Right to Vote,"  Atlanta University Center Consortium
Atlanta, Georgia 4:14 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  In our lives and the lives of our nation — the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before from everything that followed.  They stop time.  They rip away the trivial from the essential.  And they force us to confront hard truths about ourselves, about our institutions, and about our democracy.

In the words of Scripture, they remind us to “hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate.”

Last week, [Vice] President Harris and I stood in the United States Capitol to observe one of those “before and after” moments in American history: January 6th insurrection on the citadel of our democracy.

Today, we come to Atlanta — the cradle of civil rights — to make clear what must come after that dreadful day when a dagger was literally held at the throat of American democracy.

We stand on the grounds that connect Clark Atlanta — Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and near Spelman College — the home of generations of advocates, activists, educators and preachers; young people, just like the students here, who have done so much to build a better America.  (Applause.)

We visited the sacred Ebenezer Baptist Church and paused to prayed at the crypt of Dr. and Mrs. King, and spent time with their family.  And here in the district — as was pointed out — represented and reflected the life of beloved friend, John Lewis.

In their lifetimes, time stopped when a bomb blew up the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and murdered four little girls.

They [Time] stopped when John and many others seeking justice were beaten and bloodied while crossing the bridge at Selma named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

They stopped — time stopped, and they forced the country to confront the hard truths and to act — to act to keep the promise of America alive: the promise that holds that we’re all created equal but, more importantly, deserve to be treated equally.  And from those moments of darkness and despair came light and hope.

Democrats, Republicans, and independents worked to pass the historic Civil Rights Act and the voting rights legislation.  And each successive generation continued that ongoing work.

But then the violent mob of January 6th, 2021, empowered and encouraged by a defeated former president, sought to win through violence what he had lost at the ballot box, to impose the will of the mob, to overturn a free and fair election, and, for the first time — the first time in American history, they — to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

They failed.  They failed.  (Applause.)  But democracy’s — but democracy’s visi- — victory was not certain, nor is democracy’s future.

That’s why we’re here today to stand against the forces in America that value power over principle, forces that attempted a coup — a coup against the legally expressed will of the American people — by sowing doubt, inventing charges of fraud, and seeking to steal the 2020 election from the people.

They want chaos to reign.  We want the people to rule.  (Applause.)

But let me be clear: This is not about me or Vice President Harris or our party; it’s about all of us.  It’s about the people.  It’s about America.

Hear me plainly: The battle for the soul of America is not over.  We must stand strong and stand together to make sure January 6th marks not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of our democracy.  (Applause.)

You know, for the right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty.  Without it, nothing is possible, but with it, anything is possible.

But while the denial of fair and free elections is un-democratic, it is not unprecedented.

Black Americans were denied full citizenship and voting rights until 1965.  Women were denied the right to vote until just 100 years ago.  The United States Supreme Court, in recent years, has weakened the Voting Rights Act.  And now the defeated former president and his supporters use the Big Lie about the 2020 election to fuel torrent and torment and anti-voting laws — new laws designed to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections.

Here in Georgia, for years, you’ve done the hard work of democracy: registering voters, educating voters, getting voters to the polls.  You’ve built a broad coalition of voters: Black, white, Latino, Asian American, urban, suburban, rural, working class, and middle class. 

And it’s worked: You’ve changed the state by bringing more people, legally, to the polls.  (Applause.)  That’s how you won the historic elections of Senator Raphael Warnock and Senator Jon Ossoff.  (Applause.) 

You did it — you did it the right way, the democratic way.

And what’s been the reaction of Republicans in Georgia?  Choose the wrong way, the undemocratic way.  To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem.  So they’re putting up obstacles.

For example, voting by mail is a safe and convenient way to get more people to vote, so they’re making it harder for you to vote by mail. 

The same way, I might add, in the 2020 Election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House — in Florida. 

Dropping your ballots off to secure drop boxes — it’s safe, it’s convenient, and you get more people to vote.  So they’re limiting the number of drop boxes and the hours you can use them. 

Taking away the options has a predictable effect: longer lines at the polls, lines that can last for hours.  You’ve seen it with your own eyes.  People get tired and they get hungry.

When the Bible teaches us to feed the hungry and give water to the thirsty, the new Georgia law actually makes it illegal — think of this — I mean, it’s 2020, and now ’22, going into that election — it makes it illegal to bring your neighbors, your fellow voters food or water while they wait in line to vote.  What in the hell — heck are we talking about?  (Laughter and applause.)

I mean, think about it.  (Applause.)  That’s not America.  That’s what it looks like when they suppress the right to vote. 

And here’s how they plan to subvert the election: The Georgia Republican Party, the state legislature has now given itself the power to make it easier for partisan actors — their cronies — to remove local election officials.  Think about that.  What happened in the last election?  The former president and allies pursued, threatened, and intimidated state and local election officials.

Election workers — ordinary citizens — were subject to death threats, menacing phone calls, people stalking them in their homes.

Remember what the defeated former president said to the highest-ranking election official — a Republican — in this state?  He said, quote, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.” 

Pray God.  (Laughter.)  He didn’t say that part.  (Laughter.)

He didn’t say, “Count the votes.”  He said, “find votes” that he needed to win.

He failed because of the courageous officials — Democrats, Republicans — who did their duty and upheld the law.  (Applause.)

But with this new law in Georgia, his loyal- — his loyalists will be placed in charge of state elections.  (Laughs.)  What is that going to mean?  Well, the chances for chaos and subversion are even greater as partisans seek the result they want — no matter what the voters have said, no matter what the count.  The votes of nearly 5 million Georgians will be up for grabs if that law holds.

It’s not just here in Georgia.  Last year alone, 19 states not proposed but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights.  There were nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of state legislatures tried to pass.  And now, Republican legislators in several states have already announced plans to escalate the onslaught this year.

Their endgame?  To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion — something states can respect or ignore.

Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion.  It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote.  It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all.

It’s not hyperbole; this is a fact. 

Look, this matters to all of us.  The goal of the former president and his allies is to disenfranchise anyone who votes against them.  Simple as that.  The facts won’t matter; your vote won’t matter.  They’ll just decide what they want and then do it.

That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies.  We must be vigilant.

And the world is watching.  I know the majority of the world leaders — the good and the bad ones, adversaries and allies alike.  They’re watching American democracy and seeing whether we can meet this moment.  And that’s not hyperbole.

When I showed up at the G7 with seven other world leaders — there were a total of nine present — Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work — I said, “America is back.”  And the response was, “For how long?”  “For how long?”  As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.

Over the past year, we’ve directed federal agencies to promote access to voting, led by the Vice President.  We’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff.

And today, we call on Congress to get done what history will judge: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)  Pass it now — (applause) — which would prevent voter suppression so that here in Georgia there’s full access to voting by mail, there are enough drop boxes during enough hours so that you can bring food and water as well to people waiting in line. 

The Freedom to Vote Act takes on election subversion to protect nonpartisan electors [election] officials, who are doing their job, from intimidation and interference.

It would get dark money out of politics, create fairer district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering.  (Applause.)

Look, it’s also time to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  (Applause.) 

I’ve been having these quiet conversations with the members of Congress for the last two months.  I’m tired of being quiet!  (Applause.)

Folks, it’ll restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act of ’65 — the one President Johnson signed after John Lewis was beaten, nearly killed on Bloody Sunday, only to have the Supreme Court weaken it multiple times over the past decade.

Restoring the Voting Rights Act would mean the Justice Department can stop discriminatory laws before they go into effect — before they go into effect.  (Applause.) 
The Vice President and I have supported voting rights bills since day one of this administration.  But each and every time, Senate Republicans have blocked the way.  Republicans oppose even debating the issue.  You hear me?

I’ve been around the Senate a long time.  I was Vice President for eight years.  I’ve never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice that’s ready to speak for justice now.

When I was a senator, including when I headed up the Judiciary Committee, I helped reauthorize the Voting [Rights] Act three times.  We held hearings.  We debated.  We voted.  I was able to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years.

In 2006, the Voting Rights Act passed 390 to 33 in
the House of Representatives and 98 to 0 in the Senate with votes from 16 current sitting Republicans in this United States Senate.  Sixteen of them voted to extend it.

The last year I was chairman, as some of my friends sitting down here will tell you, Strom Thurmond voted to extend the Voting Rights Act.  Strom Thurmond.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wow.

THE PRESIDENT:   You can say that again: “Wow.”  You have no idea how damn ha- — how darn hard I worked on that one.  (Laughter and applause.)

But, folks, then it was signed into law, the last time, by President George W. Bush.

You know, when we got voting rights extended in the 1980s, as I’ve said, even Thurmond supported it.  Think about that.  The man who led the longest filibu- — one of the longest filibusters in history in the United States Senate in 1957 against the Voting Rights Act [Civil Rights Act].  The man who led and sided with the old Southern Bulls in the United States Senate to perpetuate segregation in this nation.  Even Strom Thurmond came to support voting rights.

But Republicans today can’t and won’t.  Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America’s right to vote.  Not one.  Not one.

We have 50-50 in the United States Senate.  That means we have 51 presidents.  (Laughter.)  You all think I’m kidding.  (Laughter.)

I’ve been pretty good at working with senators my whole career.  But, man, when you got 51 presidents, it gets harder.  Any one can change the outcome.

Sadly, the United States Senate — designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body — has been rendered a shell of its former self.  It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honored to serve in the Senate.

But as an institutionalist, I believe that the threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them, vote. 

Let the majority prevail.  (Applause.)  And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.  (Applause.)

You know, last year, if I’m not mistaken, the filibuster was used 154 times.  The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past and promote some bipartisanship.  But it’s also been used to obstruct — including and especially obstruct civil rights and voting rights.

And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desks for however long it took, and sometimes it took hours.  And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended.

But that doesn’t happen today.  Senators no longer even have to speak one word.  The filibuster is not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart.

The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.

While the state legislatures’ assault on voting rights is simple — all you need in your House and Senate is a pure majority — in the United States Senate, it takes a supermajority: 60 votes, even to get a vote — instead of 50 — to protect the right to vote.

State legislatures can pass anti-voting laws with simple majorities.  If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights by a simple majority.  (Applause.)

Today I’m making it clear: To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed — (applause) — to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights.  (Applause.)  

When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate.  

I make this announcement with careful deliberation, recognizing the fundamental right to vote is the right from which all other rights flow.

And I make it with an appeal to my Republican colleagues, to those Republicans who believe in the rule of law: Restore the bipartisan tradition of voting rights. 

The people who restored it, who abided by it in the past were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush.  They all supported the Voting Rights Act.

Don’t let the Republican Party morph into something else.  Restore the institution of the Senate the way it was designed to be.

Senate rules were just changed to raise the debt ceiling so we wouldn’t renege on our debt for the first time in our history and prevent an economic crisis.  That was done by a simple majority.

As Senator Warnock said a few weeks ago in a powerful speech: If we change the rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, we should be able to change the rules to protect the heart and soul of our democracy.  (Applause.)  He was right.

In the days that followed John Lewis’s death, there was an outpouring of praise and support across the political spectrum.

But as we stand here today, it isn’t enough just to praise his memory.  We must translate eulogy into action.  We need to follow John Lewis’s footsteps.  We need to support the bill in his name.

Just a few days ago, we talked about — up in the Congress and in the White House — the event coming up shortly to celebrate Dr. King’s birthday.  And Americans of all stripes will praise him for the content of his character.

But as Dr. King’s family said before, it’s not enough to praise their father.  They even said: On this holiday, don’t celebrate his birthday unless you’re willing to support what he lived for and what he died for.  (Applause.)

The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation’s history.

We will choose — the issue is: Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadows, justice over injustice? 

I know where I stand.  I will not yield.  I will not flinch.  I will defend the right to vote, our democracy against all enemies — foreign and, yes, domestic.  (Applause.)

And the question is: Where will the institution of the United States Senate stand?  Every senator — Democrat, Republican, and independent — will have to declare where they stand, not just for the moment, but for the ages.

Will you stand against voter suppression?  Yes or no?  That’s the question they’ll answer.  Will you stand against election subversion?  Yes or no?  Will you stand for democracy?  Yes or no?

And here’s one thing every senator and every American should remember: History has never been kind to those who have sided with voter suppression over voters’ rights.  And it will be even less kind for those who side with election subversion.

So, I ask every elected official in America: How do you want to be remembered? 

At consequential moments in history, they present a choice: Do you want to be the si- — on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?

This is the moment to decide to defend our elections, to defend our democracy.  (Applause.)

And if you do that, you will not be alone.  That’s because the struggle to protect voting rights has never been borne by one group alone.

We saw Freedom Riders of every race.  Leaders of every faith marching arm in arm.  And, yes, Democrats and Republicans in Congress of the United States and in the presidency.

I did not live the struggle of Douglass, Tubman, King, Lewis, Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, and countless others — known and unknown.

I did not walk in the shoes of generations of students who walked these grounds.  But I walked other grounds.  Because I’m so damn old, I was there as well.  (Laughter.)

You think I’m kidding, man.  (Laughter.)  It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested.  Anyway — (laughter).

But their struggles here — they were the ones that opened my eyes as a high school student in the late — in the late ’50s and early ’60s.  They got me more engaged in the work of my life.

And what we’re talking about today is rooted in the very idea of America — the idea that Annell Ponder, who graduated
from Clark Atlanta, captured in a single word.  She was a teacher and librarian who was also an unyielding champion of voting rights.

In 1963 — when I was just starting college at university — after registering voters in Mississippi, she was pulled off a bus, arrested, and jailed, where she was brutally beaten.

In her cell, next to her, was Fannie Lou Hamer, who described the beating this way, and I quote: “I could hear the sounds of [the] licks and [the] horrible screams…They beat her, I don’t know [for] how long.  And after a while, she began to pray, and asked God to have mercy on those people.”

Annell Ponder’s friends visited her the next day.  Her face was badly swollen.  She could hardly talk.

But she managed to whi- — whisper one word: “Freedom.”  “Freedom” — the only word she whispered.

After nearly 250 years since our founding, that singular idea still echoes.  But it’s up to all of us to make sure it never fades, especially the students here — your generation that just started voting — as there are those who are trying to take away that vi- — vote you just started to be able to exercise. 

But the giants we honor today were your age when they made clear who we must be as a nation.  Not a joke.  Think about it.  In the early ’60s, they were sitting where you’re sitting.  They were you.  And like them, you give me much hope for the future.

Before and after in our lives — and in the life of the nation — democracy is who we are, who we must be — now and forever.  So, let’s stand in this breach together.  Let’s love good, establish justice in the gate. 

And remember, as I said, there is one — this is one of those defining moments in American history: Each of those who vote will be remembered by class after class, in the ’50s and ’60s — the 2050s and ’60s.  Each one of the members of the Senate is going to be judged by history on where they stood before the vote and where they stood after the vote. 

There’s no escape.  So, let’s get back to work. 

As my fath- — my grandfather Finnegan used to say every time I walked out the door in Scranton, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.”  Then he’d say, “No, Joey, spread it.” 

Let’s spread the faith and get this done.  (Applause.) 

May God bless you all.  And may God protect the sacred right to vote.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I mean it.  Let’s go get this done.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

,,Biden must work harder to earn this Black woman’s vote,"President Joe Biden’s current campaign message is basically “I’m the best bad option.” Best Bad is a strategy for those destined to lose, since it forces the voters to negotiate against themselves. I’m someone who never misses an election, including one-off local races. I’m not only a lawyer who believes in democracy, the spirit of the Constitution and that citizens are duty-bound to vote, but I’ve volunteered many times as an attorney for Election Protection, a nonpartisan organization that helps Americans ensure their voting rights and access to the polls.  If Biden wants my vote, he must diligently earn it one policy position and decisively-filled campaign promise at a time. I won’t give it away freely just because the alternative is catastrophic.  As a member of one of the strongest voting blocs — Black women — I’m tired of listening to lip service. The way Biden takes Black people’s votes for granted is never lost on me. He assumes that he doesn’t have to do much to secure our vote since the other candidate is a corrupt white nationalist grifter who preys on women and is a threat to democracy. It’s a slap in the face. (Remember when Biden said “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black”? We remember.) Unfortunately for Biden, my memory is long and unforgiving. The stakes are too high — for me, Black people and the entire country — to get amnesia. Votes must be earned, especially from a president whose track record is both racially offensive to me and misaligned with my ideological views.  I remember when I was an adolescent in Berkeley, California. Between classes, I listened on my portable radio to Anita Hill testify about the sexual harassment she said she endured from Clarence Thomas. I never forgot that then-Senator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. His bungling of the hearings and fears of challenging a problematic Black man manifested in throwing a courageous, credible Black woman under the bus. We pay for Biden’s poor leadership each time Justice Thomas casts his Supreme Court vote. Strike one.  Then there’s the 1994 crime bill, which ushered in mass incarceration. Strike two. Skipping over his senatorial record with too many strikes to count and jumping to his presidency, he hasn’t done enough for Black people, and Black women in particular, for me to see him as a strong ally.  During his presidency, I’ve witnessed performative photo ops using Black people as tokenized props, along with verbal hot air. He sidelined Vice President Kamala Harris until he needed a mouthpiece with people of color, then dragged her out of obscurity to try to get nonwhite votes or rating bumps with communities of color. More strikes.  Biden failed to deliver on his campaign promises on student loans, which could have provided countless Americans much-needed debt relief. He took too long listening to unhelpful and sometimes obstructionist advisors, only to announce a plan that was dead on arrival. This is his failure. If you want to successfully launch a program against fierce opposition, be ready to cancel loans on announcement day and not weeks later after unveiling your gameplan. A broken-promise strike due to delays, ineptitude and poor planning. Looking from the outside, I see a man governing and trying to play an outdated game that no one wants to play with him. They’ve taken their ball and gone home, yet he’s still dribbling alone. He doesn’t adapt with the times. To protect civil rights and the Constitution — and thus the voting rights of people of color, abortion rights of women and freedom from religious tyranny — you need a different Supreme Court. But Biden lacks the going-to-the-mattresses backbone necessary to overhaul the courts. This leaves people of color without affirmative action, which has ballooned into a wholesale assault on diversity, equity and inclusion. Along with other rolled-back rights, the progress of the 20th century is unraveling. Strike 1,000. Many Black people struggle witnessing people of color dying in ways that remind us our collective lives don’t matter. This brings us to Biden’s devastating and calamitous handling of the crisis in Gaza. While we can universally declare that what happened to Israelis on Oct. 7 was horrific, inexcusable and the hostages deserve their freedom, Hamas’s attacks cannot justify a death toll of nearly 30,000 people — most of whom are women and children. More than 10 children lose one or both of their legs each day. Palestinians in Gaza are on the verge of famine. This intolerable humanitarian suffering prompted leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church to call for ending aid to Israel. When did advocating for peace and an end to death and destruction become the subversive global policy position? As a Black woman who values life and a former United Nations World Food Programme professional, it’s hard to vote for a president complicit in what the UN International Court of Justice said is plausibly genocide, who has made me equally complicit as an American. Even though Trump is the worst president in American history and a horrible human being, what Biden presents isn’t motivating enough. He will be hurt by low turnout. Many Black voters will stay home. Positioning himself as “the best bad option” will also tank Biden in swing states like Michigan, where many in the Arab American community call him “Genocide Joe,” demand a ceasefire and won’t vote for him. My questions for you, Mr. President: What do you stand for beyond being the Best Bad candidate? What about your policies deserve my vote? What are you doing for people of color? How will you protect my rights as a Black woman? When will you get on offense instead of defense? What’s your compelling platform to grow the economy for the middle class? When I get satisfactory answers to those questions, then you will have earned my vote. Until then, you’re not reading the room. You will lose because you failed to create a situation where people want to vote for you, rather than against an atrocious alternative. And if Trump wins and takes a wrecking ball to democracy, that failure will be on your hands.

,,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?," Some Pennsylvania voters say President Biden’s warning that Donald Trump threatens U.S. democracy is not reaching beyond Democratic voters. Some Democratic voters say Trump is a threat and hold him responsible for the events of January 6, 2021. (Feb 17) (AP Video: Mike Rubinkam) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there.  “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. Evelyn Fermin speaks during an interview, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” Curt Balch poses for a photo in Hellertown, Penn. on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Christian Miller speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. Anna Kodama speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews Pennsylvania voters again suggest it’s not resonating. Kodak said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem Chapter of the NAACP, talks about the presidential election in Bethlehem, Penn., Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. Guillermo Lopez Jr. speaks during an interview Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,"Remarks by President Biden on Protecting the Sacred, Constitutional Right to Vote","  National Constitution Center
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 2:46 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  (Applause.)  I see an awful lot of good friends out there.  Please have a seat if you have one.  I — let me begin by saying I used to be important.  (Laughter.)  I used to be the chairman of the board of this place.  And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while. But thank you all for being here.  I truly appreciate it.  Governor, it’s above and beyond the call.  Mr. Mayor, I’d compli- — I thought you were a great mayor — still think you are — but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger.  And — but — but all of you.  And a good friend, Bobby Brady.  I see so many friends out.  Al Sharpton — Al, how are you, pal?  It’s great to see you.  (Applause.) And I’m — I’m going to get in trouble here because I’m going to recognize my congresswoman from the state of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester — (applause) — and her sister who used to run my office.  Stand up.  (Applause.) Well, folks, good afternoon.  There’s a serious subject I’d like to talk about today.  I’m here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center — the city and the place where the story of “We the People” — “We the People” began. It’s a story that’s neither simple nor straightforward.  That’s because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human.  And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace. But some things in America should be simple and straightforward. Perhaps the most important of those things — the most fundamental of those things — is the right to vote.  The right to vote freely.  (Applause)  The right to vote freely, the right  — the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted.  The democratic threshold is liberty.  With it, anything is possible.  Without it, nothing — nothing.  And for our democracy and the work — and to deliver our work and [for] our people, it’s up to all of us to protect that right.  This is a test of our time and what I’m here to talk about today. Just think about the past election.  A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton. A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her seventy-se- — 72nd consecutive election.  You know what she said?  She said this election was, quote, “the most important vote that we ever had.” The daughter who voted in the memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn’t have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through.  Patients out there.  And the parents — the parents who voted for school their children will learn in.  Sons and daughters voted for the planet they’re going to live on. Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference. America — America and Americans of every background voted.  They voted for good jobs and higher wages.  They voted for racial equity and justice.  They voted to make healthcare a right, not a privilege. And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote — to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary.  In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable. As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever — ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic.  (Applause.) All told, more than 150 [million] Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote. They voted early.  They voted absentee.  They voted in person.  They voted by mail.  They voted by drop box.  And then they got their families and friends to go out and vote. Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure.  They did so with unyielding courage and faith in our democracy. With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history.  Challenge after challenge brought to local, state, and election officials; state legislatures; state and federal courts — even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice. More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments.  In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges.   Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times.  It’s clear.  For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards. The Big Lie is just that: a big lie.  (Applause.) The 2020 election — it’s not hyperbole to suggest — the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this nation.  This should be celebrated — the example of America at its best.  But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst — something darker and more sinister. In America, if you lose, you accept the results.  You follow the Constitution.  You try again.  You don’t call facts “fake” and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy.  That’s not statesmanship.  (Applause.)  That’s not statesmanship; that’s selfishness.  That’s not democracy; it’s the denial of the right to vote.  It suppresses.  It subjugates.  The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented. From denying enslaved people fu- — full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 100 years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the ‘50s and ‘60s; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just two weeks ago –- a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks — election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat — the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th. I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G7 and to NATO.  They wonder — not a joke — they wonder, Gov — they ask me, “Is it going to be okay?”  The citadel of democracy in the world, “Is it o- — going to be okay?” Time and again, we’ve weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections.  And each time, we found a way to overcome.  And that’s what we must do today. Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work.  And I’ve asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy.  And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R.1, the For the People Act.  (Applause.) That bill — that bill would help end voter suppression in the states, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering.  Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the People Act.  Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote.  We must pass the For the People Act.  It’s a national imperative.  We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand — (applause) — to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression.  All the congresswomen and men here — there’s a bunch of you — you knew John, many of you. Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, “a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities.” The Court’s decision, as harmful as is, does not limit the — Congress’ ability to repair the damage done.  That’s the important point.  It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength. As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it.  (Applause.)  That will be an important moment.  And the world is wondering — the world is wondering — and Dwight knows what I’m talking about, for real.  You know, the world is wondering, “What is America going to do?” But we also have to clear-eyed about the obstruction we face.  Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool.  And it’s not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today.  For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways.  (Applause.) The focus — the focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia’s vicious anti-voting law. The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that — at my request — is doubling its size in enforcement staff.  (Applause) Civil rights groups — civil rights groups and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts. In Texas, for example, Republican-led state legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil impartial poll workers.  They want voters to dive [drive] farther and be able to be in a position where they wonder who’s watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote.  To drive a hell of lot lo- — excuse me — a long way — (laughter) — to get to vote.  They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don’t vote at all.  That’s what this is about. This year alone, 17 states have enacted — not just proposed, but enacted — 28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention — and catch this — nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the state legislatures are trying to pass. The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real.  It’s unrelenting, and we’re going to challenge it vigorously.  While — (applause) — while this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it’s taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms. It’s no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote.  It’s about who gets to count the vote — who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all.  It’s about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties. To me, this is simple: This is election subversion.  It’s the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history.  Never before have they decided who gets to count — count — what votes count. Some — some legi- — state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote.  And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn’t count for any reason they make up. They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses. And they’re trying — not only targeting people of color, they’re targeting voters of all races and backgrounds.  It’s with a simple target: who did not vote for them.  That’s the target. It’s unconscionable.  I mean, really, I — it’s hard to — it’s hard to declare just how critical this is.  It’s simply unconscionable. We’ve got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad — which I spent time with Putin talking about — but from home.  From home. We must ask those who represent us at the federal, state, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people?  Will you ignore their voices? We have to ask: Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy?  That’s what it’s coming down to. Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to for- — forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party — the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives — and raise the urgency of this moment. Because as much as people know they’re screwing around with the election process, I don’t think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts — literally, not figuratively.  You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President.  State legislator comes along — under their proposal — and they say, “No, we don’t like those electors.  We’re going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman.” Because here’s the deal: In 2020, democracy was put to a test — first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy. I’ve been around a long time in public life.  I thought I’ve seen it all or most of it all.  But I never thought I’d see that, for real.  And in spite of what you see on television — and you saw it — you have senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol. Folks — but we met the test.  Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials — many of them Republicans; our court system; and those brave Capitol police officers — because of them, democracy held. Look how close it came.  I mean, for real, how close it came.  We’re going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion.  We have to prepare now. As I’ve said time and again: No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting.  They will decide, and the power must always be with the people. That’s why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022.  We’ll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out. We’ll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level. We will be asking my Republican friends — in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties — to stand up, for God’s sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote.  (Applause.)  Have you no shame?  (Applause.) Whether it’s stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together. Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there’s real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life. The Founders understood this.  The women of Seneca Falls understood this.  The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement understood this.  So must we. This isn’t about Democrats and Republicans; it’s literally about who we are as Americans.  It’s that basic.  It’s about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow.  And quite frankly, the whole world is watching.  Folks — (applause). I’m not being sentimental.  I’m not preaching to you.  I’m just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do — lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth]. So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today — an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are — who we are as Americans.  For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.  It gives me no pleasure to say this.  I never thought in my entire career I’d ever have to say it.  But I swore an oath to you, to God — to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.  And that’s an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.  (Applause.)  The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally.  I’ve said it before: We’re are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.  That’s not hyperbole.  Since the Civil War.  The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th. I’m not saying this to alarm you; I’m saying this because you should be alarmed.   I’m also saying this: There’s good news.  It doesn’t have to be this way.  It doesn’t have to be, for real.  We have the means.  We just need to show the will — the will to save and strengthen our democracy.  We did it in 20- — we did it in the 2020.  The battle for the soul of America — in that battle, the people voted.  Democracy prevailed.  Our Constitution held.  We have to do it again.   My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country.  It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up.  (Applause.)  We will not give in.  We will overcome.  We will do it together.  And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do.  (Applause.)   Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, “Freedom is not a state; it is an act.”  “Freedom is not a state; it is an act.”  And we must act, and we will act.  For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full.  (Applause.)  For “We the People,” for our democracy, for America itself, we must act.  (Applause.) God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy.  (Applause.)  But act.  We’ve got to act.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 3:10 P.M. EDT   The White House

,,Biden’s Young Voter Problem Just Got Even Worse,"Young voters are proving decidedly less interested in a 2024 Biden win than they were four years ago. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Tuesday indicates that most young voters are leaning toward voting for Donald Trump, with the indicted former president pulling 49 percent of the vote from constituents aged 18 to 29, with Biden at just 43 percent. That’s a stark contrast from July, when young voters preferred Biden by as much as 10 percentage points. The difference is likely due to the president’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, in which Biden has been a staunch ally to Israel. That’s resulted in a 72 percent disapproval rating within the same age bracket, according to the poll. However, faced with Trump on the other side of the ballot, those voters say they may be more likely to stay home than turn up to the voting booths. “I don’t want to vote for someone who is not aligned with my own personal values, as Biden has shown he is not when it comes to Gaza,” Colin Lohner, a 27-year-old software engineer in San Francisco, told The New York Times. “Do I vote for Biden or do I not vote at all? That’s really difficult, because if I don’t vote for Biden, I open up the possibility that Trump will win, and I really do not want that.” So far, the conflict has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians and displaced 1.9 million people living in the Gaza Strip—roughly 90 percent of its population—since the war began on October 7. The dwindling poll numbers are an alarming difference for the beleaguered president, who needed the support of young and minority voters to clinch his 2020 bid for the White House. Biden has voiced his own concern, reportedly marking his favorability ratings as a known issue in a closed-door White House meeting with top aides the day before Thanksgiving. At the time, Biden was neck and neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. And yet, the president is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president in a national survey, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote against Trump’s 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to prevent an expert witness from testifying in his upcoming defamation trial against writer E. Jean Carroll. In a fun twist, the expert witness is the same woman who helped set massive damages for Rudy Giuliani. A federal judge ruled in September that Trump is liable for defaming Carroll in 2019 and owes her monetary damages. The exact amount will be set during the trial, which will begin in January. Trump’s lawyers filed a motion on Wednesday asking presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan to bar Ashlee Humphreys, a Northwestern University marketing professor who analyzes social media trends, from testifying against the former president next month. In the court documents, lawyer Michael Madaio argued that the damages estimates Humphreys had previously submitted were too high. “The damages estimations in her initial report are egregiously inflated (to the tune of millions of dollars), utilize methods which ascribe harm in an unreliable and incorrect manner; and do not accurately reflect the actual harm to plaintiff’s reputation,” Madaio wrote. Madaio took particular issue with the fact that Humphreys had initially included estimates for alleged damage caused by three different comments Trump made. Carroll is no longer suing over one of those statements, but Madaio argued Humphreys had not adjusted her estimate accordingly. Carroll’s lawyer hit back Monday, pointing out that Humphreys had indeed accounted for the change in estimated damages in a supplemental report. “Trump is understandably desperate to get rid of Professor Humphreys,” Roberta Kaplan (no relation to the judge) wrote in a filing asking to reject Trump’s request. “That Professor Humphreys recently testified in another case that resulted in a $108 million defamation verdict likely adds to Trump’s sense of urgency.” Kaplan was referring to the defamation case against Giuliani. The former Trump lawyer was found liable in August for defaming Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. On Friday, Giuliani was ordered to pay the women a whopping $148 million in damages. Humphreys testified against Giuliani on December 13, the same day Trump’s lawyers filed the motion to bar her from appearing at the Carroll trial. Her testimony was pivotal in determining the exact amount of damages he owed. Humphreys is no stranger to Carroll’s case against Trump. The Northwestern professor already testified in Carroll’s first defamation lawsuit against the former president. In May, a jury unanimously found Trump liable for sexual abuse and battery against Carroll in the mid-1990s and for defaming her in 2022 while denying the assault. He was ordered to pay her $5 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s estimates. Carroll’s second lawsuit is for comments Trump made in 2019, when he said she made up the rape allegation to promote her memoir. Judge Kaplan ruled that since Trump has already been found liable for sexual abuse, his 2019 comments are by default defamatory. Carroll is now seeking up to $12 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s recommendation. Clearly $148 million in legal penalties isn’t punishment enough for Rudy Giuliani, who took to Newsmax’s airwaves on Monday to vent even more defamatory lies about Georgia poll workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. “Your initial allegations, do you still believe them to be true?” asked host Rob Schmitt. “Yeah. Well, of course they’ll sue me again when I say that, but yeah, I do,” Giuliani said. “But they want me to lie. They, basically, they are suing me in order to lie to them.” “If I showed you the evidence right now, and I think you’ve played it on your air, people would see that what I said was absolutely true,” he said. Unfortunately for the former federal prosecutor, claiming that people made him lie may not be the concrete defense he hopes it to be. .@RudyGiuliani on defamation ruling: ""It's a fascist system run by the Biden regime; they turned the court system into a two-tiered system of justice."" @SchmittNYC pic.twitter.com/4FFY3fooqy Before last week’s judgment, Giuliani repeated election lies that he had previously admitted were untrue mere steps outside the courthouse, resulting in a wrist slap by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who warned that it could result in more defamation charges for the broke fixer. And despite repeated promises to provide evidence on his debunked allegations, when the time came to finally take the stand and make “definitively clear” that what he said about the pair of workers was true, Giuliani opted not to. Freeman and Moss originally sought $24 million each in damages after the former New York City mayor accused them of manipulating ballots—claims that transformed into months of harassment, death threats, and protesters at their doorsteps. Instead, the jury decided they deserve far more. On Friday, a court ruled that the mother-daughter duo would receive $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages from the former Trump attorney. On Monday, the pair hit Giuliani with another lawsuit seeking a gag order and to permanently bar America’s disgraced mayor from continuing to trash-talk them. That new suit is based entirely on baseless claims that Giuliani made over the weekend, including some statements allowed to air on Newsmax, according to the legal complaint. “Are they actually going to put a gag on me while I walk around?” Giuliani joked on air. If there’s one thing you can count on Republicans for, it’s to tepidly push back on Donald Trump’s most vile comments. Trump drilled down harder than ever on fascist language during two weekend speeches. On Saturday, he said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” The next day, he promised to use federal law enforcement funds to combat a “military invasion” at the southern border. But when asked about his comments late Monday, Republican senators had only the mildest of rebukes. “I obviously don’t agree with that. I mean, we’re all children of immigrants,” Senator Shelley Moore Caputo told Politico, somehow managing to “All Lives Matter” immigration. Senator Roger Wicker said he “certainly wouldn’t have said that,” and Senator Thom Tillis called Trump’s words “unhelpful.” Senators John Kennedy and Todd Young declined to comment, although Young joked he was “looking forward to another year of answering these questions.” “Drugs, criminals, gang members, and terrorists are pouring into our country at record levels. We’ve never seen anything like it. They’re taking over our cities,” Trump said over the weekend. He then promised to “shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.” No GOP senators have called for Trump to apologize. Their lukewarm stance should come as no surprise, though. This is a familiar tune for Republican lawmakers. Throughout Trump’s presidency, Republicans regularly evaded questions about his inflammatory rhetoric. Lawmakers would say they hadn’t seen the former president’s posts on social media or during speeches. Sometimes they would say they disagreed with his stance; other times they would quietly adopt his position. In fact, Republicans were perfectly happy to let Trump’s words slide so long as he continued to give them what they wanted in terms of policy and judicial appointments. This has continued since Trump left office, for instance last November, when Trump met with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and antisemite Kanye West. No members of Republican leadership ever explicitly condemned the meeting. Some lawmakers even tried to claim that Trump didn’t know who he was meeting or that he had condemned Fuentes’s previous comments. The Georgia election workers that Rudy Giuliani defamed sued the former Trump attorney again on Monday for continuing to make defamatory statements about them. Giuliani was found liable in August for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, after he accused the pair of manipulating ballots in Georgia during the 2020 election. The two women have been subjected to months of harassment and death threats. A judge ordered Giuliani on Friday to pay Freeman and Moss nearly $150 million in damages last week. Freeman and Moss filed a fresh defamation lawsuit against Giuliani Monday for refusing to take a hint. “Defendant Giuliani continues to spread the very same lies for which he has already been held liable in the Freeman I action,” the lawsuit said, referring to the previous case. In fact, on December 15, “just hours after the jury in Freeman I returned a $148 million verdict against him, Defendant Giuliani appeared from Washington, D.C. for a live interview on Newsmax, in which he repeatedly asserted, either directly or at minimum by implication, that he was in possession of video evidence demonstrating the truth of his allegations against Plaintiffs.” Giuliani has already admitted that he made false statements about Freeman and Moss. In a July court filing, he acknowledged that his “statements carry meaning that is defamatory.” At the time, he insisted he only made that concession to move the lawsuit forward. Except he moved it forward right to a ruling of liability. And on Friday, a jury decided he owed the mother and daughter $148 million: $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages. Monday’s lawsuit is only seeking to bar Giuliani from making or repeating any more false claims about Freeman and Moss. The women have also requested he pay their legal fees for the new suit, but they are not asking for further financial damages. That could be because Giuliani is so hard up for cash that he will likely struggle to make the payments from Friday’s ruling. Giuliani has begun representing himself in court to save some cash. The man once affectionately known as “America’s mayor” is scrambling to find the money for all his legal fees and even listed his Manhattan apartment for sale in July. In August, after he was indicted in Georgia, Giuliani asked his social media followers to donate to his defense fund. He also flew to Mar-a-Lago to beg his boss Donald Trump to pay him for working as Trump’s personal attorney. That didn’t work, but Trump did agree to host a fundraiser dinner for Giuliani. Entry cost: $100,000 a plate. What’s more, people keep suing him for money owed. Several of Giuliani’s former lawyers, including his longtime attorney Robert Costello, have sued Giuliani for failing to pay their legal fees. Meanwhile, Giuliani’s ex-wife says he owes her more than $260,000 for her country club memberships, condominium fees, and health care as part of their divorce settlement. Giuliani narrowly avoided jail time over that lawsuit in December. And one of Giuliani’s former associates sued him in May, accusing him of promising to pay her a $1 million annual salary but instead sexually harassing and abusing her over two years. Joe Biden is finally fed up with his second-rate polling numbers. The night before the president took off to celebrate Thanksgiving, he gathered his closest aides in the White House to talk about a game plan for his tanking numbers, according to several unnamed sources who spoke to The Washington Post. For months, the president and his first lady had expressed frustration at the Democrat’s disappointing numbers, but the night before Thanksgiving proved to be a turning point in which Biden complained to his team that his numbers were unacceptably low. That night, he asked his team what they planned to do about it, according to the outlet. At the time of the meeting, Biden was neck-and-neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. But Biden’s numbers have only continued to plummet since then, likely influenced by the president’s foreign policy: Many Democrats reject his unwavering support of the Israeli invasion of Gaza while others are frustrated by his inability to wrangle Congress to send along more aid to the Ukrainian war front against Russia. At the same time, Biden is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote while Trump curried 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Top Democrats have warned for months that the Biden campaign had failed to scale up its national campaign quickly enough. Just one year out from Election Day 2024, the campaign has only recently announced leadership teams in battleground states like Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and South Carolina, according to campaign officials. “The Republican primary could end quickly, and the general election could begin in weeks, not months,” Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, told the Post. “Given Trump’s noisiness and his ability to bully his way through the daily information wars, I think it’s really important that the Biden campaign move into general election mode as soon as possible. We’re not where we want to be. Some of our coalition is wandering, and we need to go get them back.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams has an interesting opinion on what makes the Big Apple so great: It could be subject to a terrorist attack at any moment. In a Monday interview, Adams was asked to sum up 2023 in one word. “New York,” Adams replied, which is technically two words. “This is a place where everyday you wake up, you could experience everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a person who’s celebrating a new business that’s open. This is a very, very complicated city, and that’s why it’s the greatest city on the globe.” DAN MANNARINO: [Describe the year in one word & tell me why that word.]

MAYOR ADAMS: ""New York. This is a place where everyday you wake up you could experience… a plane crashing into our Trade Center… And that's why it's the greatest city on the globe.""

DM: ""Uh-huh.""

🤷🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/6VNG83j8Bd The utter lack of imagination in Adams’s “one word” answer aside, this is an extremely bad take. A city isn’t great because one of the most traumatic experiences in recent American memory happened there. And you certainly aren’t going to curry favor with your constituents by warning them it could easily happen again. Adams has been in office for about two years, and he recently recorded the lowest-ever approval rating for a New York mayor. A poll released in early December by Quinnipiac University found just 28 percent of respondents said they approved of Adams’s performance. His popularity certainly isn’t helped by his penchant for very strange behavior. In August, Adams chose to mark the anniversary of Indian independence by comparing himself to Gandhi. Adams has also repeatedly said he has carried a photo of a fallen police officer in his wallet for decades. Instead, Adams allegedly instructed his staff in 2022 to print out the photo and then age it with coffee stains. Meanwhile, the mayor is facing a federal investigation into his campaign, as well as an accusation of sexual assault from 30 years ago. Elon Musk may be held accountable for X (formerly Twitter) devolving into a hellscape. The European Commission on Monday opened multiple investigations into the platform under the bloc’s new social media law. The Digital Services Act went into effect in Europe in late August. The sweeping new rulebook aims to create safer online environments: Digital platforms are required to prevent and remove posts that contain illegal goods, services, or content. Targeted ads based on sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs are prohibited, and ads targeting children are heavily restricted. “We now have clear rules, ex-ante obligations, strong oversight, speedy enforcement and deterrent sanctions and we will make full use of our toolbox to protect our citizens and democracies,” EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told Politico. The infringement proceedings into X are the commission’s first ever under the DSA. The four probes will look at whether the platform violated rules on combating illegal content and disinformation, as well as rules on transparency regarding advertising and data sharing. Investigators will also seek to determine if X misled its users when it changed its blue-check system. The check marks used to indicate that a user’s identity had been verified, but they now show that the user is paying a subscription fee in exchange for increased visibility. The investigations do not immediately indicate wrongdoing. But if X is found culpable, the company could face fines of up to 6 percent of its global revenue. The commission has also taken preliminary steps to investigate other major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. Investigators have requested information to see how the platforms combat illegal content and disinformation, and how they protect minors. This isn’t the first time the European Commission has taken aim at X owner Musk. In November, the bloc froze ads on the platform, following a Media Matters report that found X has been placing ads for brands including Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Xfinity next to posts that promote Hitler and Nazi beliefs. Hate speech has flourished on X in the little more than a year since Musk bought the platform. The social media research group National Contagion Research Institute found that in the 12 hours after Musk bought X, use of the n-word increased almost 500 percent. And Musk is often a major source of that hate speech and disinformation. In addition to aggressively antisemitic posts, Musk also regularly lets Nazis back on X, shares transphobic content, and spreads conspiracy theories. The American people will never be rid of George Santos—at least not according to him. In a one-on-one interview with comedian Ziwe on Monday, the indicted former Long Island representative said that he would one day return to Congress after outliving the members who voted to expel him, claiming he’ll have plenty of time since he’s only 35 years old. It’s not the first time that Santos has threatened his return to the House’s lower chamber. “I’m not done with public service. I want to go back to Congress,” Santos told radio host Frank Morano on Wednesday, just two weeks after he stormed out of Congress claiming he was done with politics. “I’m not saying today. I’m not saying tomorrow.” “I have a lot of things I need to take care of first,” he said on the program. “I think we all know, but I do have hopes of trying to regain the trust of the American people and going there, because I will continue to expose and root out the rot in our federal government.” Whether or not Santos returns to Congress, it’s unlikely we’ll get him entirely out of our system. The Republican is reportedly making more than $80,000 per day for bespoke videos on the mid-tier celebrity messaging platform Cameo—significantly more than his $174,000 congressional salary during his nine-month term. According to Santos, the only way we’ll stop seeing him is if comedians, producers, and interviewers “stop inviting [him] to your gigs.” “But you can’t because you want the content,” he quipped. i asked george santos if he knew who james baldwin was. watch the FULL interview on YouTube now. link in bio pic.twitter.com/1GsimbKAL7 In another dystopian twist in the interview, Santos rapped Nicki Minaj’s verse from Kanye West’s “Monster” after failing to identify Marsha P. Johnson, James Baldwin, and Harvey Milk. The confrontational comedian also got down to brass tacks with Santos over the baby debacle, in which the politician emerged holding a mysterious baby mid-meltdown while feuding with a Palestinian activist just weeks before his expulsion. Clarence Thomas was in so much debt two decades ago that he tried to get Supreme Court justice salaries raised across the board. Within months, Republican billionaires began giving him extravagant gifts. Thomas spoke at a conservative conference in January 2000, according to a new ProPublica report. In what we now know to be classic Thomas style, he did not report that trip on his financial disclosure forms. On the way home, he sat next to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns. During the flight, Thomas complained bitterly that his salary—then $173,600—was insufficient. He even hinted that multiple justices could resign in the next year if they weren’t given a pay raise. Thomas’s words sparked a rush of attempts on Capitol Hill to significantly raise the justices’ salaries or at least ensure their pay kept pace with inflation. Specifically, Republicans wanted to make sure that Thomas and his fellow staunch conservative Antonin Scalia did not leave the bench. Thomas also petitioned then–Chief Justice William Rehnquist to lift a ban on justices giving paid speeches. Ultimately, the attempts to give justices more money all failed. But soon after, a group of Republican billionaire megadonors began lavishing Thomas and his family with a steady stream of gifts. It is still unclear what exactly prompted the gift-giving, or if it was directly tied to Thomas’s money complaints. But certainly, many of those gifts have alleviated the justice’s financial concerns. One of those generous souls is billionaire Harlan Crow, who has been friends with Thomas for more than two decades. In that time, Crow—a Nazi memorabilia collector—has repeatedly lavished Thomas with expensive gifts. These include island-hopping yacht vacations, private school tuition for Thomas’s nephew, and buying and renovating a Thomas family property, where Thomas’s mother still lives. Crow has also regularly brought Thomas as his guest to the Bohemian Grove, which ProPublica has previously described as a “secretive all-men’s retreat in Northern California” that attracts major corporate and political players. Looking at Thomas’s finances, though, it would seem that keeping pace with inflation wasn’t the main issue. When he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1991, he still had student loans from law school. But during the early 1990s, he made at least two big purchases: a Corvette and a house in Virginia with five acres of land. Thomas and his wife bought the house for $522,000 in 1992. They were able to pay $8,000 out of pocket and had to borrow the rest, according to property records. The couple borrowed huge sums of money throughout the next decade, including a consumer loan of $50,000 and a $100,000 line of credit on their house. In 1998, Thomas became his grandnephew’s legal guardian and began sending him to pricey private schools. The month before Thomas complained about his salary to Stearns, he had borrowed $267,000 from a friend to buy a luxury R.V. That purchase partially paid off, though: In 2001, Thomas took his R.V. to get serviced outside Tampa. While there, he met Earl Dixon, the owner of a Florida pest control company, who ended up giving Thomas $5,000 for his grandnephew’s tuition. “My wife and I are doing fine. We don’t live extravagantly, but we are fine.” A few weeks later, Crow took the Thomases on a yacht vacation.

,,Biden needs young voters. Can his climate policy rally them?,"Celebrate 25 years of reporting on the ever-evolving world of energy and the environment. Join us 7-DAY UNLIMITED ACCESS  To win a second term, the president must reach what one expert called the “untapped potential” of young Americans who don’t know about his climate policies. President Joe Biden smiles at a group of young supporters last year at the Democratic National Committee winter meeting in Philadelphia. Matt Rourke/AP President Joe Biden has to compete against two foes in November’s election: former President Donald Trump and the living room couch. Young people helped deliver victories for Democrats in the last two election cycles, motivated by issues like climate change, abortion rights and gun control. But Biden risks losing some of those voters — not to Trump, his likely opponent, but to disaffection. Come Nov. 5, many young people might just stay home, pollsters and other experts told E&E News. “I don’t think there’s a risk that any substantial number of them would go over and vote for Donald Trump, but I do think there’s a real risk that they won’t be energized and that they’ll stay home,” said Tom Bonier, a longtime Democratic political strategist and senior adviser to TargetSmart polling firm. Young voters have turned out in record numbers in recent years, becoming key not only to Biden’s 2020 win, but also to Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm elections and 2023 off-year elections. But there are already warning signs that 2024 could be different. A recent poll from Harvard University’s Institute of Politics found that 49 percent of people 29 and younger say they “definitely” plan to vote in the presidential election — down from 57 percent at this point in the 2020 election cycle. One piece of good news for Democrats is that young Republicans and independents account for the largest share of that drop. Still, Biden in particular may need to rally young voters to win a second term. In the 2020 election, young voter turnout was a record 50 percent nationally, a sharp 11-percentage-point increase from 2016, according to Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. That turnout topped 50 percent in many of the key swing states that delivered the election to Biden, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. “When you consider the role that young voters played in Biden’s victory three years ago, it’s going to be really important for him and his coalition to be able to energize young voters and get them out to vote,” Bonier said. People aged 29 and younger who expect to vote in this year’s election rank the economy, gun control and climate change as their top issues, the Tufts survey found. The climate voters are the most motivated. Seventy-two percent of those who ranked climate policy as their top issue said they were likely to vote, according to the survey. That same group was 37 percent more likely to say they would vote Democratic. But there are still many climate-minded voters who would need to be convinced that they should vote for Biden. The Tufts survey found a significant number of young people are worried about climate change and believe political leaders have done nothing to address it, said Sara Suzuki, a senior researcher at Tufts. The vast majority have heard nothing from any campaign. Overall, only about 1 in 5 young people surveyed had heard from any campaign. “There’s really a gap and untapped potential among young people who really have this concern but don’t know what is being done,” she said. Biden has overseen the most aggressive climate policy of any president in modern history. The Inflation Reduction Act — which he signed into law in 2022 — injected billions of dollars into electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines and other clean energy technology. In the last year, EV sales broke records, tens of thousands of U.S. clean energy manufacturing jobs were created and the first offshore wind turbines came online. This year, the administration will roll out major new climate rules and regulations that will limit planet-warming emissions from power plants and vehicles, implement new fees on methane emissions, and impose more stringent requirements on the fossil fuel industry to calculate its greenhouse gas pollution. Under Biden, EPA has also sharply increased its estimate for the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions, which can help federal agencies justify stricter climate rules. And yet, many Americans are unaware of Biden’s efforts, let alone his landmark climate law. A majority of Americans, or 58 percent, have only heard a “little” about the Inflation Reduction Act, a Yale University survey released last month showed. At the same time, the administration’s fossil fuel policies have angered some of the young progressives that Biden will need in November. That’s because Biden has also overseen record levels of oil and gas production. The U.S. is now producing a daily average of about 13.2 million barrels of crude oil, up from a peak of 13 million under Trump and more than the next two top-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Some fossil fuel projects advanced by the administration, especially Alaska’s Willow project and Mountain Valley pipeline in West Virginia, are also targets of viral TikTok videos, alienating at least some segments of young voters. Despite those challenges, the Biden campaign is preparing to use climate policy as one of the sharpest contrasts with Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris will be a key part of that outreach, White House officials say. Biden and Harris will spend the year “laying out the dire stakes of this election so they can secure reelection and continue to advance the essential work of creating clean energy jobs and leading the world toward a more sustainable future,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster. Harris will continue last year’s strategy of talking about climate policy with college audiences and social media influencers, while also attending groundbreakings for clean energy projects around the country. She is also expected to focus her speeches on climate — even during unrelated events. During a visit last week to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, for example, Harris talked about the importance of improving air quality for local front-line communities. “I think you’ll see on the youth engagement part a continued effort for the vice president to go to where young people are, use platforms young people use and speak in a way that is resonant to young folks,” said Ike Irby, special assistant to the president and deputy domestic policy adviser to the vice president. The White House and its allies are now running a nationwide education campaign on Biden’s climate policies and the work that still needs to be done in a second term. That includes an $80 million effort from Climate Power, a communications organization that is partnering with super political action committee Future Forward to rally voters in the key swing states expected to decide the election. Voters of Tomorrow, an organization focused on mobilizing and engaging Gen Z voters, is also joining the effort, conducting outreach on college campuses and reaching out to people who will be voting in their first presidential election. Many young people want Biden to do more on climate, but also recognize that they “have a seat at the table” with him, whereas Trump has ignored their concerns, said Jack Lobel, the group’s spokesperson and a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia University. There is still time to highlight the massive difference between the two candidates, he said, and shrink the pool of young voters who don’t know what Biden has already accomplished on climate policy. “When we see this disconnect between Joe Biden and his policies, that presents opportunities for us,” he said. “It’s not a bad sign, it’s just a sign we have a lot of work to do.” Request a FREE trial to receive unlimited access to  The transformation of the energy sector.

,,Why Biden should be thankful it's not 2024 yet,"And what some other politicians might be feeling grateful for this week. Welcome to 538’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited. tia.yang (Tia Yang, editor/reporter): It’s Thanksgiving week, and the presidential turkeys have already been pardoned. Liberty and Bell, this year’s lucky birds from Minnesota, are surely thankful to be heading back home this holiday season. And with most politicians doing the same, here at 538, we thought we’d chat about what we think some of them might be feeling thankful for. We’ll start at the top with President Joe Biden, who just turned 81 on Monday. Maybe his birthday wish was for some better polling heading into 2024. But what does the president have to be thankful for this Thanksgiving? leah.askarinam (Leah Askarinam, politics reporter): That current horse-race polling isn't predictive. nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): Hahaha. leah.askarinam: Did I steal yours? nrakich: You didn't steal mine, but I was going to say, it's an awkward time to be asking what Biden should be thankful for, given the polling slump he’s in! His average approval rating has fallen below 40 percent in 538's tracker. There's a lot of dissatisfaction among his base about his handling of issues like the economy and the war in Israel-Gaza. And he trails former President Donald Trump in most general-election polls. leah.askarinam: Right. Recent polls have yielded some bad news for Biden — for example, his approval rating declined to his lowest ever in the latest NBC poll, which is widely respected among politicos. But even more interesting to me was how NBC summed up a slew of other record-breaking bad numbers that poll included for Biden. For example, it's the first time the poll found Biden behind Trump in a hypothetical general-election matchup. And one of the pollsters, Republican Bill McInturff, told NBC that the impact the Israel-Hamas war has had was unprecedented, because foreign affairs don't usually hit American presidents quite this hard. Perhaps Biden could be thankful that outlier polls exist and could potentially account for some of the bad numbers, although it seems unlikely given recent trends. nrakich: Yeah. But I think your first point is absolutely right, Leah — Biden can be thankful that this is November 2023, not November 2024. I'm skeptical that the Israel-Hamas war is going to stay in the headlines long enough to be one of the deciding issues of the 2024 general election. It's a long campaign. We're in a bad news cycle for Biden right now. But there is time for several more news cycles to come and go before Election Day. Including some news cycles that will probably be bad for Trump! And that's what I think Biden should be thankful for: the fact that he is very likely going to be running against Trump, who is almost as unpopular as he is, who may very well be convicted of multiple crimes in the next year, and who has a unique ability to energize the Democratic base. If you think the polls are bad for Biden against Trump, take a look at his polls against former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. A Fox News poll that put Biden 4 points behind Trump nationally put him 11 points behind Haley. A Marquette Law School poll that put Biden 2 points behind Trump nationally (among likely voters) put him 12 points behind Haley. Now, I don't think Haley would win by that much (no one has won the popular vote by more than 9 points since 1984). But I think if Republicans nominated anyone but Trump, they would be favorites to win back the White House in 2024. tia.yang: Plus the fact that Biden’s silver lining is that he’s running against someone almost as unpopular as he is only underlines the fact that he's less popular than Trump. Heading into the 2020 election, Trump was nearly as unpopular as he is now, but Biden's favorability was in positive territory. Now Biden is the unpopular incumbent. That could be bad news for him when it comes to turning out his base. leah.askarinam: Right, they're both quite unpopular. But I still think Trump has a harder ceiling than Biden, and the biggest threat to a Biden victory is voters staying at home or voting third-party. But to that point, I'd add to Biden's list of things to be thankful for that the off-year elections indicate that voters are still responding to messaging on protecting abortion rights. A new Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found a record-breaking share of Americans — 55 percent — say women should be able to get an abortion for any reason. tia.yang: Good point, Leah. A September NBC poll found that voters trust Democrats over Republicans on abortion (and health care) more than on any other issue, and we can expect them to continue emphasizing that issue to drive turnout. Let's move on to the other side of the horse race. Nathaniel, what do you think Trump's feeling thankful for? nrakich: Haha, my snarky answer is that Trump should be thankful for the fact that he'll probably run against Biden! The same things I said above for Biden go for Trump too: If Democrats had a younger, less unpopular nominee like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Sen. Raphael Warnock, Trump would be a serious underdog. But instead, Trump will probably run against one of the only politicians in America who’s more unpopular than he is. leah.askarinam: I think there's a slight unknown there though, Nathaniel. We know that Biden versus Trump is basically a dead heat at this point, because Biden's weaknesses are, theoretically, manageable for Democrats. He can still run on abortion rights and preserving democracy, even if voters think that as a human being he is simply too old to be president. He won't win a landslide, but he can certainly win the presidency anyway. To compare this to Biden’s odds against a more popular Republican, the only reason we know Haley fares well on a national stage is because ... she is running for president and is faring decently on a national stage. But we don't know how Whitmer or Warnock would fare on a national stage until we see one of them on it. nrakich: That's fair! tia.yang: That same Fox News poll that had Biden trailing Haley also found Trump leading Democratic alternatives like Whitmer and Vice President Kamala Harris in a theoretical matchup. But as Leah said, these matchups are more hypothetical than, say, Haley versus Biden. Leah, what about you? What else should Trump be thankful for? leah.askarinam: Trump should be thankful that the latest round of polling that declares Nikki Haley is ""surging"" in New Hampshire also means that she finally made it into the double digits. In other words, Trump should be thankful that he's so far ahead in the GOP primary polls! tia.yang: Right. While Haley's polling looks good in a theoretical matchup against Biden, it's not looking so good against Trump. A recent Harvard CAPS-Harris poll of registered Republican voters found her at 19 percent to Trump's 81 percent in a head-to-head primary race. nrakich: Yeah, my alternative answer was going to be that Trump should be thankful that Republican voters are still so loyal to him, even after he lost in 2020. Historically, parties usually want nothing to do with their losing presidential nominees — Democrats moved on quickly from Hillary Clinton after 2016, Republicans from Mitt Romney after 2012. But not Trump after 2020. Of course, maybe that's not too surprising when you consider that 69 percent of Republicans believe Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. tia.yang: Trump does hate losing, so he’s definitely thankful for that! Let’s pivot to the legislative branch. In the wake of a House speakership crisis and amid a looming government shutdown, public approval for Congress has been as low as 13 percent in recent polls — 538’s approval tracker had it at its lowest point all year at the end of October. But after 10 straight weeks in session, Speaker Mike Johnson’s House managed to avoid (or at least delay) a holiday season shutdown by punting the next federal funding deadline to January. What does Johnson have to be thankful for? leah.askarinam: I would say that Johnson should be thankful that he won enough votes to become speaker, which should indicate that it's not impossible to unite the GOP conference around a single issue. nrakich: Johnson should be thankful that everyone in Congress is tired and just wants to go home, haha. In order to keep the government open, Johnson had to compromise with Democrats and pass a continuing resolution. In other words, he had to do exactly what former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did. In both cases, the House Freedom Caucus was outraged — but while McCarthy famously lost his job for his transgressions, Johnson still has his. Someone could have very easily tried to file a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson too. But I think, after all the chaos in the House in October after McCarthy was ousted, the appetite just wasn't there for that. leah.askarinam: So, should Johnson be thankful that the right wing of the Republican Party ousted McCarthy? nrakich: I guess so, Leah? Assuming that being speaker of the House is actually something to be thankful for ... leah.askarinam: That is a leap indeed, Nathaniel. But I do think Johnson ended up being the right person at the right time, and that's something to be thankful for. nrakich: In all seriousness, though, the speakership seems to me like a thankless, nearly impossible job right now, given the slim majority Republicans are working with. Honestly, I think McCarthy should be thankful that he doesn't have to worry about it anymore. tia.yang: Yeah, to address Leah's first point about GOP unity, I'm skeptical anyone could unite the GOP conference around spending issues. It’s going to be an uphill battle for Johnson. Even before he got the funding extension passed, many were noting that the new speaker’s honeymoon period with conservatives seemed to have ended — and that seems even more true after he passed it. leah.askarinam: Right. Maybe Johnson should just be thankful for his friends and family, because work is going to be tough. tia.yang: To that point, I think all members of Congress are probably pretty thankful not only to be home for Thanksgiving, but for the absence of a government funding deadline right before Christmas or New Year’s, thanks to Johnson’s CR that extended current funding through Jan. 19 or Feb. 2. This is the first time in over a decade (since 2012) that Congress doesn’t have at least one government funding deadline in the month of December. Last year it passed an omnibus spending bill on Dec. 23, and in 2021, it set five different funding deadlines in December alone. So while he may have run out his rope with hardline conservatives, the fact that Johnson got this funding extension passed at all could do a lot to cool things down after a particularly testy November in Congress. He’s the speaker who saved Christmas! On brand for him. nrakich: Yeah, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is not a Christmas movie! leah.askarinam: So, if Johnson saves Christmas, who's the grinch? tia.yang: Chip Roy would love to declare himself the grinch. But seriously, the Freedom Caucus and anti-establishment wing that ousted McCarthy over cutting that initial spending deal stands ready to be the grinch in this scenario. As Nathaniel noted, they gave Johnson a pass this time, but they’re not happy that he extended funding at fiscal 2023 levels, which were set by Democrats back in 2022. What about elsewhere in Congress? What other Thanksgiving hot takes do you guys have? leah.askarinam: Well, since you asked: I think the first-term Republican congressmen from New York who are facing tough elections in November 2024 are thankful for the House Ethics Committee report that alleged “substantial evidence” that Rep. George Santos paid for personal expenses with campaign funds. Santos announced he won't seek reelection, but he faces a major threat before that, with a resolution to expel him from Congress expected to come to the floor after Thanksgiving. I think some Suffolk County and New York Republican Party leaders will be thankful, too. Santos's antics in Congress just weren't a good look while other New York Republicans are making the case to voters that, despite the ""R"" next to their name, they're common-sense politicians who can represent Biden voters' interests. Santos, meanwhile, will still allegedly have some things to be thankful for, including, according to the House Ethics report, what should be truly fantastic skin, made possible by spa visits and Botox. nrakich: Haha. Santos should be thankful that he still has his job — at least for now. Ahead of the expected vote on whether to expel him next week, I guess Santos should also be thankful that it requires a two-thirds vote to expel a member and that only five representatives in history have ever been expelled. leah.askarinam: And he already survived another resolution to expel him recently! It's not over! tia.yang: It says a lot about how bad a look Santos has been for New York Republicans that they were the ones leading that initial charge to oust him — right after the GOP speaker battle emphasized how much every Republican vote counts with such a small majority. Nathaniel, what's your parting Thanksgiving hot take? nrakich: I think this is a pretty cold take, but Mitch McConnell should be thankful for the 2024 Senate map. Needing just one or two flips to take control of the Senate (depending on who wins the vice presidency), Republicans have three great pickup opportunities in states that Trump carried by at least 8 points in 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. McConnell should be extra thankful that Joe Manchin, the Democratic incumbent in West Virginia, decided not to run for reelection, which virtually assures that Republicans will pick up that seat. Sorry, that was not nearly as fun as Leah's. leah.askarinam: I think McConnell should be thankful for his position in general — he gets to be the grown-up in the room next door to a chaotic House conference, and he doesn’t have run for reelection himself in 2024, since his term ends in 2026. And, I think there might be a long list of Republicans who would be thankful for a Joe Manchin presidential run! He’s openly considering one, lamenting that Biden has gone “too far left.” tia.yang: Manchin going from Senate kingmaker to presidential election spoiler would be a maximally chaotic power move from him. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948,
,,Biden isn’t on the ballot in New Hampshire’s primary. Here’s why,"Matt Loffman Leave your feedback Twenty-one Democratic candidates will appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, but incumbent President Joe Biden isn’t one of them. He’s the first president running for reelection to skip the Granite State primary in more than 50 years. Why? It’s all about a change to the Democratic National Committee’s rules that made South Carolina — not New Hampshire — the first official primary of the Democratic presidential nominating cycle. Because the New Hampshire primary is “non-compliant” with new DNC rules, the national party deemed the contest “meaningless.” The winner next Tuesday will be in name only, walking away with no delegates to the convention in August. New Hampshire leaders – both Republicans and Democrats – were not pleased, banding together to uphold state law that requires its voters to have the first primary New Hampshire Attorney General Brendan O’Donnell filed his own cease-and-desist letter accusing the DNC of engaging in voter suppression. “This is the election,” said New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, who oversees the state’s election process. “There is no other election taking place in New Hampshire where delegates are going to be awarded to the convention. So whether the Democratic National Committee decides to recognize those delegates or not, that’s on them.” Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.  The DNC instructed candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate” in the New Hampshire primary as currently scheduled. Two high-profile Democratic challengers ignored the DNC: Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, an author making her second run for the nomination. Biden chose to skip the state altogether. “It’s really unfortunate and sad that the president of the United States chose not to be on the New Hampshire ballot,” Scanlan told the NewsHour. “The decision not to do that comes across as petty, but New Hampshire is moving forward with or without him.” Enter the “write-in Biden” effort. It’s a grassroots and mostly volunteer campaign led by the president’s supporters in New Hampshire, and it’s running on a shoestring budget. Organizers hope to recruit thousands of volunteers to stand outside every voting location in the state to tell people how to write-in the president’s name on the ballot. Since the effort launched last fall, a super PAC has also joined the effort, spending about $1.25 million so far on direct mailings and advertising. A sample New Hampshire ballot showing all 21 Democratic candidates. Not listed? President Joe Biden. Image courtesy of New Hampshire Secretary of State While high-profile Democrats in and out of the state are vocally supportive of the write-in effort, it is unaffiliated with Biden’s official reelection campaign. The goal is simply to get Joe Biden a victory, and organizers are lowering expectations for what a victory looks like. One Democrat connected to the super PAC told the NewsHour a win is getting just one more vote than the candidate in second place. Write-in campaigns can be a logistical nightmare that require a lot of voter education. The president’s supporters have to explain to voters to look all the way at the bottom of the ballot — skipping the long list of Democratic candidates — to fill in a bubble and write the president’s name. Organizers say one thing is to their advantage: “Joe Biden” is an easy name to spell. They take comfort in the successful 2010 write-in campaign of Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, which required significant ad spending to teach voters how to spell her name. Plus, New Hampshire’s secretary of state is expected to allow misspellings to count if the voter’s intent is clear. Recent polling suggests that despite the challenges of a write-in campaign, Biden has a comfortable lead over the 21 candidates whose names are actually on the ballot. More than three-quarters of Democratic voters have decided who they will vote for, and 69 percent plan on writing in Biden’s name, according to a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll. That’s far ahead of Phillips and Williamson, who have 7 and 6 percent respectively. (In March 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last incumbent to run as a write-in candidate in New Hampshire, won a narrow 7-point victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy before dropping out of the race later that month.) Phillips entered the campaign in late October and has been trying to grow his name recognition in the months since, recently running his first ads in New Hampshire. While his advisers at one time suggested he could win more than 40 percent of the vote, Phillips recently told Politico that finishing around 20 percent “would be magnificent.” He also suggested that getting anything less than 60 percent of the vote should be troubling to the incumbent. The eventual winner of the Democratic primary will have a lot to do with voter turnout on Tuesday. With an incumbent running without major competition, the secretary of state would usually expect lower turnout in the Democratic race, but the write-in campaign is complicating his turnout projections. Scanlan estimated Friday that voter turnout would be about 410,000 voters, just less than half of registered voters in the state. Expected turnout for Republicans was close to four times that of Democrats, according to his projections. Nearly 40 percent of the state’s voters are unaffiliated with a political party and can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. That includes around 4,000 Democrats who switched their voter registration to undeclared ahead of the October deadline. Many intend to vote in the Republican primary. “The energy and the enthusiasm and the interest is clearly on the Republican side because of the number of candidates who are engaged in that race,” Scanlan said. Thalia Floras, a lifelong New Hampshire resident, changed her party registration for the first time ever ahead of this election, from Democrat to undeclared. She has grown weary about Biden’s age and thinks he should not have run for a second term. But because her vote in the Democratic primary for either Williamson or Phillips (“both great candidates,” she said) would not count toward their delegate totals, she’s planning to vote for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Republican primary instead. “I want to boost the candidate that not only could have a chance to beat Donald Trump but that I can respect as my president,” she said. Floras and her friend Hella Ross went to dozens of town hall meetings to hear from the candidates directly and learn about their positions. Ross, another lifelong Democrat, was also hoping to vote in the Democratic primary and said she would support either Phillips or Williamson as the nominee. “This particular election is calling for desperate measures,” she said. Like her friend, she plans to vote for Haley, who she believes is “best positioned right now to defeat Trump.” The prospect of Democrats staying home or undeclared voters choosing a Republican ballot is just one of the complicated calculations ahead of election day next week. A Democratic primary with potentially a large number of write-in votes will complicate counting, too. Many smaller towns in the state hand count all of their ballots. Larger cities will have machines that separate out the write-in ballots that will then be counted by hand. Local election officials have been recruiting extra volunteers to help with the counting, which will continue on primary night until every vote is counted. That won’t be unusually late, the secretary of state said. Despite the hand count, there is just one race on the ballot, which Scanlan said will simplify the process. He expects most of the results to be reported by 10 p.m. local time, just two hours after the last polls close.

,,The Moral and Strategic Calculus of Voting for Joe Biden to Defeat Trump — or Not,"ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DONALD TRUMP ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system’s regular offerings. And he focused on hate. To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies. Literally everything this man does is a racket. His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump’s predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “smarter” way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama’s policies killed a lot of innocent people. The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump’s military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term. Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates. The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at. Trump’s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly, babble incoherently, or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him. Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation. Demonstrators gather in front of the Colorado State Capitol building to protest coronavirus stay-at-home orders during a “ReOpen Colorado” rally in Denver, Colorado, on April 19, 2020. PERHAPS THE MOST devastating dimension of Trump’s time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP’s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day. The public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump’s running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man. With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they’ve cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers. Trump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he’s going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media. More broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump’s time in office is profound and terrifying. Out in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban — and in some ways has succeeded in banning — Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge? Trump’s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won’t openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in. Donald Trump’s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let’s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history. What would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers’ rights, civil rights, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus, and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly. IT IS IN contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden’s chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that “I’m not Trump” combined with Biden having been Obama’s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake. There is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump’s core belief that corruption isn’t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election’s integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities. Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden’s cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for, and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing. In numerous interactions with voters, Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner; told an immigrant rights activist to “vote for Trump”; called voters childish names; and threatened a union worker in Detroit, telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker “want[s] to go outside with me.” Let’s not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding “Corn Pop” at the pool. Trump’s temperament is frightening, but Biden isn’t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence. Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. “You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,” is not a good line. “Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency” — also not a winning zinger. And don’t think for a moment that Trump won’t hammer away on Biden’s Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election. There is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden’s career, his policy record, his mental stamina, or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination. All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months. The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden’s candidacy. Obama and other senior party leaders, major news organizations, and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality. Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot. Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men, the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden. What we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying. What we get with Biden, in his current form, is less apparent. Biden will have a team of competent (for better and worse) technocrats and, in all likelihood, an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show. Biden’s administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas. It will, without a doubt, also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish, corporatist Democratic apparatchiks. It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street, believes in bloated war budgets, and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire. It’s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can’t even bank on a return to Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way. Biden isn’t great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden’s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric. Biden’s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts. There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden’s record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration. The Obama-Biden administration’s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “deporter in chief,” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “big mistake.” At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama’s torrid pace of deportations. “Absolutely not,” he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden’s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn’t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process. Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can. Biden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “a pariah.” That’s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom’s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected. Former US Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden arrives to speak about COVID-19, known as the Coronavirus, during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware on March 12, 2020. Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don’t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don’t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “the team” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten. So what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office. It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, “I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, “I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.” None of these people’s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump. Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush. If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “bending the knee” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care. Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders’s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama’s troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden’s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden’s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes. In the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party’s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s. Unlike Ralph Nader’s independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party’s own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory. Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party’s primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters. The traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders. The war for the future of the Democratic Party is intensifying. There is a possibility of a fracture or at least more clearly defined factions within the party. There will be serious discussions around forming a new party that isn’t the Green Party, but rather an outgrowth of the “Not Me, Us” framework of the Sanders campaign and the growing popularity of groups like the Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, prison abolitionists, immigrant rights groups, and Democratic Socialists of America. It would be a great thing for this country to have a democratic socialist party grow, one that runs serious political campaigns. We have already seen early stage efforts at this with mixed results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez understands the need to engage in strategic partnerships with establishment Democrats to achieve meaningful policy change and strengthen the areas of common ground. But there will need to be a lot more like-minded politicians elected for the strategy to succeed. This primary has shaken the Democratic establishment to its core, and that is a good thing and should be built on. But none of that is going to happen before November. Some Sanders supporters who are deeply concerned by the candidacy of Biden have said he can have their vote but not their soul. For many people that will be their strategic rationale. For others, it will be a question of individual or collective morality in the face of Trump’s horrors. Leftist voters in swing states shoulder a greater moral burden than the rest of us, and many will decide to vote against Trump by pulling the lever for Biden. There are also very vocal opponents of Biden who are fed up and are flat out going to refuse to vote for him. They recognize that the opposite of Trump is not Biden. They want a society where free health care is a right and wars are ended, where everyone has housing and work that pays livable wages, where you don’t amass a mountain of debt to get an education, and one that treats immigrants and workers with dignity and defends a woman’s absolute right to choose. They want the racist justice system dismantled and ICE to be abolished. They believe we are in a climate emergency and that Biden is a part of the problem. Mainstream Democrats tell them they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don’t believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats’ cheap dates — treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted. If Democrats want to try to win them over, they should use the next six months to show them you take their concerns about 2016 seriously and map out the ways this campaign is different. Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump. For them, “He’s not Trump” is not a gamble worth taking. The onus is on the Biden campaign and its supporters to make their case to every eligible voter in this country and earn their votes. No one should be taken for granted. The End of Roe Natasha Lennard With Roe v. Wade dismantled, far-right courts are coming for all aspects of reproductive health care.

,,,"   The Quinnipiac University poll showed that 49 percent of registered voters support Biden and 45 percent support Trump, but 67 percent said the 81-year-old president is too old to serve another term. By 02/21/2024 03:27 PM EST President Joe Biden narrowly leads former president Donald Trump even though an overwhelming majority of voters are worried about his age, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed. The poll, conducted from Feb. 15 to Feb. 19, found that 49 percent of registered voters support Biden and 45 percent back Trump in a hypothetical general election matchup. However, 67 percent of voters said the 81-year-old president is too old to effectively serve another term — compared with 57 percent who said the same of Trump, who is 77. Only 34 percent said Biden had the mental fitness to serve a second term, while 48 percent believed Trump is mentally fit. Age has become an increasingly prominent issue in both the GOP and Democratic presidential primaries. Trump’s primary opponent, former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, has taken swipes at both men over their age and Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips launched his challenge to Biden largely over his concerns that Biden’s age rendered him unfit to run — and win — against the former president.

Justice Department attorneys say the former source, Alexander Smirnov, has reported extensive contacts with high-level Russian intelligence operatives and could use those alleged connections to flee justice if allowed to remain out of custody. Prosecutors working for David Weiss, the special counsel probing issues related to the president’s son Hunter, obtained an indictment of Smirnov last week on charges of making false statements to the FBI and obstruction of justice. Smirnov was arrested at the Las Vegas airport last week as he returned from a trip abroad, and the Justice Department indicated he had another lengthy foreign trip planned just days from now.

The memo includes a “vacation reading packet” of potential threats if the funding is not approved, including Russia advancing on the Ukrainian battle line and a decline in American defense manufacturing. It also lists support from the Border Patrol Union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for the Senate's bipartisan border deal, which House Republicans rejected. Since the Senate approved a $95 billion national defense supplemental, the White House has been hammering House Republicans to simply take up the bill and approve it. But Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team called the bill “dead on arrival” in their chamber and said they wouldn’t bring it to a vote.

The administration’s latest tranche of loan forgiveness covers borrowers who are enrolled in Biden’s new loan repayment program, initially borrowed $12,000 or less and have been repaying their debt for at least 10 years. Biden will tout the relief and his administration’s broader efforts to cancel student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans during remarks in Los Angeles on Wednesday. The White House said the event will include some of the borrowers who will benefit from the announcement as well as those who’ve previously had their debts canceled by Biden.

Ambassador Nikki Haley is attracting thousands of donations from people who gave to President Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign as she tries to cobble together a coalition of anti-Trump voters. More than 5,200 donors to Biden’s 2020 campaign have backed Haley financially, including roughly 1,600 who gave more than $500,000 in January alone, according to a POLITICO analysis of Haley’s most recent fundraising report, filed Tuesday night with the Federal Election Commission. That report lists donors who give at least $200 total, and Haley’s campaign reported raising money from more than 55,000 such “large-dollar” donors in the month of January, and 123,000 in total over the course of her entire campaign. But crossover donors, who give to politicians of both parties, are generally rare in politics, making the number of donors who previously gave to Biden notable. It’s especially striking because Haley is currently running in the Republican primary to be the nominee to take on Biden in November. Still, Haley’s fundraising base is predominantly Republican. Over 3,000 large-dollar donors who previously gave to Trump in 2020 financially supported her campaign in January, and nearly 10,000 overall this cycle. Taken together, Haley’s ability to draw from both former Biden and Trump donors illustrates the coalition she has sought to piece together, which includes moderate and independent voters who are unhappy with Biden, Trump or both. Read More »       2024 ELECTIONS The former president compared his own legal entanglements to the death of the Russian opposition leader. 02/20/2024 09:14 PM EST Former President Donald Trump likened the $355 million judgment against him in a New York civil trial to the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday evening. “It is a form of Navalny. It is a form of communism or fascism,” he said, before going on to attack the judge in the case, Arthur Engoron, who he called a “nut job.” Trump compared himself to Navalny, the outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in prison on Friday, on several occasions during the event. Earlier in the town hall, Trump praised Navalny as a “very brave guy” because he chose to return to Russia, where he had been jailed since 2021, though Trump said he “probably would have been a lot better off staying away and talking from outside.” “People thought that could happen and it did happen,” Trump said, referring to Navalny’s death. “And it’s a horrible thing.” Read More » Prosecutors said that during an interview before his arrest last week, Alexander Smirnov admitted that “officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story” about Hunter Biden. | Jose Luis Magana/AP LEGAL Prosecutors revealed Tuesday that Alexander Smirnov had contacts with officials affiliated with Russian intelligence. 02/20/2024 08:05 PM EST LAS VEGAS (AP) — A former FBI informant charged with making up a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving President Joe Biden, his son Hunter and a Ukrainian energy company had contacts with officials affiliated with Russian intelligence, prosecutors said in a court paper Tuesday. Prosecutors revealed the alleged contact as they urged a judge to keep Alexander Smirnov behind bars while he awaits trial. He’s charged with falsely reporting to the FBI in June 2020 that executives associated with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma paid Hunter and Joe Biden $5 million each in 2015 or 2016. The claim has been central to the Republican impeachment inquiry in Congress. Smirnov was due in court Tuesday in Las Vegas. He has been in custody at a facility in rural Pahrump, about an hour drive west of Las Vegas, since his arrest last week at the airport while returning from overseas. Defense attorneys David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld said in a statement ahead of the hearing that they were asking for Smirnov’s release while he awaits trial “so he can effectively fight the power of the government.” Read More » Tom Suozzi, 61, called the president “old” on a conservative network the day before the special election for a suburban swing seat in New York. | Mary Altaffer/AP CALIFORNIA “It’s a conversation that we should be thinking about,” Rep. Katie Porter told POLITICO. 02/20/2024 02:46 PM EST Two prominent Democrats are openly acknowledging concerns about President Joe Biden’s age at a crucial time for their own political future. Newly elected Rep. Tom Suozzi, just before winning a tight race in a special election in New York, stated on FOX 5, “the bottom line is, he’s old” and Rep. Katie Porter, ahead of the March 5 primary for the California Senate seat, embraced age limits for all elected officials. This chink in the party armor on what was once a taboo subject could expand in the months leading up to November as Democrats try to distance themselves from an unpopular president or cast themselves as change agents in crowded races. “It’s a conversation that we should be thinking about,” Porter, who is still backing Biden, told POLITICO after broaching age limits during a televised debate.

Without offering any electoral strategy for her path forward, Haley described her candidacy as a battle for something “bigger than myself.” And she cried as she invoked her husband’s military service, describing how he couldn’t be with her because he is deployed, and that America was worth fighting for. Haley’s speech served as something of a raison d'être for a candidate who lost decisively to Trump in Iowa and New Hampshire and is verging on a blowout loss in South Carolina. She pledged to continue on despite calls from high-level GOP leaders for her to end her presidential bid and support him as the party’s likely nominee. Read More » President Joe Biden's Education Department rolled out a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid system, but it's been dogged by significant processing delays that are upending this spring's college admissions cycle. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images EDUCATION The Government Accountability Office has opened two new investigations into the administration’s handling of the situation. 02/20/2024 11:54 AM EST President Joe Biden’s attempt at making it easier for tens of millions of families to access federal aid for college has turned into a government technology blunder reminiscent of the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov. The Biden administration has spent three years working to implement a bipartisan law Congress passed in December 2020 that overhauled the federal financial aid formula and mandated a new, simpler Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. But repeated delays with the project are now coming to a head: The Education Department is unable to process new FAFSAs on time, forcing millions of families to wait weeks, if not months, longer than usual to receive their financial aid packages this spring. The turmoil has already prompted dozens of colleges — including major state university systems — to postpone their typical May 1 deadline for students to commit to their institutions, and many are concerned that more delays are coming. “This is equivalent at some level to the IRS not being able to collect tax returns on April 15,” said David Bergeron, a former senior Education Department official who served across multiple administrations. “For people whose kids are in high school today or starting college in the fall, this is a basic operation of government that they just assumed would move along as expected.” Read More »    02/20/2024 11:46 AM EST  Read More » The Biden campaign got off to a frugal start but has staffed up and spent more on television and digital advertising over the past few months. | Alex Brandon/AP 2024 ELECTIONS The Democratic president and DNC ended January with $130 million cash on hand. 02/20/2024 05:01 AM EST President Joe Biden’s political operation said it raised $42 million in January, continuing to amass cash as he gears up for a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump. The total, which includes funds from Biden’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee and related joint fundraising committees, is a large haul for the incumbent president, although it still trails what Trump and the Republican National Committee had built up at this point in 2020. The Biden campaign released the fundraising total ahead of Tuesday’s midnight deadline with the Federal Election Commission, when presidential campaigns, party committees and certain other groups have to report their latest fundraising figures. Details of how much money was in Biden’s campaign and the DNC were not yet available Tuesday morning. The president’s political operation continues to stockpile cash reserves, saying it had $130 million cash on hand across all entities as of the end of January, up from $117 million at the end of December. The Biden campaign got off to a frugal start but has staffed up and spent more on television and digital advertising over the past few months.

Biden held it up as an example of exactly what he wanted the new law to support. “Nearly one-third of all the chips in the world use polysilicon made in Hemlock,” Biden said in a speech from the White House South Lawn. “Imagine if we had more of these kinds of factories across the country. This law will make that a reality.” Now the administration is getting ready to unleash the law’s flood of tax breaks — estimated to be worth more than $25 billion over a decade. But instead of supporting Hemlock, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service have proposed rules that would cut the company out. Lawmakers say Biden and the administration are not meeting the intent of the law.

Sulzberger said Monday that the White House is “extremely upset” about its coverage on President Joe Biden’s age but the newspaper will “continue to report fully and fairly.” “We are going to continue to report fully and fairly, not just on Donald Trump but also on President Joe Biden,” Sulzberger said in an interview with The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. “He is a historically unpopular incumbent and the oldest man to ever hold this office. We’ve reported on both of those realities extensively, and the White House has been extremely upset about it.” Criticism over coverage of Biden’s low approval ratings and, more especially, Biden’s age has sparked disapproval both from the Biden campaign and some members of the press. News stories of Biden’s age gained even more traction among the press as special counsel Robert Hur wrote in his recent report, entirely without prompting, that Biden was “an elderly man with a poor memory.” Read More »    WHITE HOUSE ""It's just shocking. I've never seen anything like it,"" the president said Monday. 02/19/2024 11:41 AM EST President Joe Biden called the behavior of House Republicans “shocking” on Monday for “walking away from the threat of Russia” for not passing aid for Ukraine. “The way they’re walking away from the threat of Russia, the way they’re walking away from NATO, the way they're walking away from meeting our obligations. It's just shocking. I've never seen anything like it,"" Biden said in remarks to reporters on the White House lawn. Biden’s frustrations with House Republicans have increased after the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died Friday in prison. The president urged House Republicans to pass aid for Ukraine on Friday, saying, “It’s about time they step up, don’t you think,” instead of going on an extended recess, which he called a “two-week vacation.” Read More » National security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrive for a meeting at the State Department in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 8, 2023. | Kevin Lamarque/Reuters via Redux Pictures WASHINGTON & THE WORLD Globalization and free markets had time to prove themselves. Now, a new “Bidenism” is emerging. 02/19/2024 07:00 AM EST On April 27, 2023, the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank that for years has served as a beacon of Democratic establishment thinking, was about to be the site of a major reshaping. One of the party’s leaders, Jake Sullivan, was about to challenge long-held beliefs and lay out a road map for the nation’s ideological future. The times were changing, and America had to change with them. Brookings is a legendary place, among the most famous think tanks in the world. It’s the kind of institution presidents visited to give great speeches and senior officials went to for outside policy counsel, and where the capital’s elite waited out an opposing party’s administration while itching to serve with a like-minded team. Now it would serve as the birthplace of a quiet revolution. For weeks, Jake Sullivan and his team crafted an address that was nominally about the administration’s views on economics. But it would really serve as a critique of orthodoxy in America’s capital, a bludgeon to U.S. foreign policy thinking that was so prominent in the gilded halls of Brookings and among Washington’s well-heeled.

,,South Carolina Democratic primary: Are black voters losing faith in Joe Biden?,"Black voters were a key part of the coalition that helped Joe Biden win the White House, and he will need their overwhelming support to do it again. In South Carolina, however, many are frustrated with the president - and some are backing Donald Trump. A 40-minute drive from the sparkle and polish of Columbia, South Carolina, is the town of Winnsboro, which lacks both. It's a place Nocola Hemphill calls home - a home which, as she describes it, sounds like it's a world away from the state capital. Empty streets, abandoned businesses and vacant homes. Joblessness. Hopelessness. It's been that way for years, she says. ""There's no one reaching down here to lift anyone up. You have to wonder, does anyone really care?"" The 47-year-old is the CEO of the US Black Women's Chamber of Commerce, an organisation supporting small business development for black women across the country, an effort she says hasn't been noticeably aided by the Biden administration. ""I voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but I'm still waiting,"" Hemphill says. ""I'm still waiting on tangible change for my vote - for my people."" Just a few days before the Democratic primary election in her state - the first contest in the process to formally pick the party's presidential candidate - she wasn't sure if he still had her vote. And she's not alone. A recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Other surveys suggest black voters are warming to Donald Trump, the current Republican frontrunner and President Biden's likely November opponent. These are votes the president cannot afford to lose. His 2020 win over Mr Trump was in part driven by black voters. They helped him win in critical swing states, including Georgia, where a historic black voter turnout made Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1992. Todd Shaw, a University of South Carolina political science professor, told the BBC that if Mr Biden fails to get a strong showing from black voters from the state in Saturday's primary, it could spell trouble for his campaign for re-election.""Black voters in South Carolina mirror trends among black voters nationally. So, what happens here could be an indicator of what's to come."" President Biden pushed hard to change his party's rules so that South Carolina is the first state to vote in the nomination process. A Biden campaign adviser told the BBC the move was intended ""to make sure the process reflected the diversity of our party"". Over a quarter of South Carolina's population is black. And it was South Carolina's black voters who saved Biden's lacklustre bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 by handing him his first win. ""You're the reason I'm president,"" Mr Biden told a mostly black crowd in the state one evening in January. ""You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser, and you're the reason we're gonna win and beat him again."" It was one of several stops Mr Biden and his supporters have made in South Carolina this year, smiling for cameras at historically black colleges, shaking hands at barbershops, all the while, reminding voters of the ""record achievements"" his administration has made in their communities. The BBC spoke to lots of voters in the state who do support the president - and he's expected to win the primary comfortably. For many South Carolina black voters, however, the president's words feel disconnected from their realities. Kenard Holmes, a junior at South Carolina State University (SCSU), told the BBC he was not excited by Mr Biden's campaign. ""I know I'm going to vote. I'm just not sure who I'm voting for."" The 20-year-old remains unconvinced of the historic investments the White House says it has made into black colleges like his. In the university building where Holmes meets weekly with his gospel choir, he says conditions are ""embarrassing"". ""If it's cold outside, it's cold in there. If it's hot outside, it's hot in there,"" Holmes says. ""It's been like that for years."" Data shows that other black voters in South Carolina have similar reasons to be disenchanted. In 2022, eight of the state's top 10 counties with the highest poverty rates were majority black - averaging over 27%. And in more bustling areas like Charleston, US census data shows poverty rates were nearly twice as high in one of the city's majority-black neighbourhoods compared to its majority-white county. Although the state is run by Republicans, there is a sense the president could have done more. Matthew Guah, the dean of SCSU's business school, agrees that although money has been invested into black communities, it hasn't been substantive enough to move the needle. ""Record investment just means more than before. Record investment doesn't mean they got everything they need,"" he says. Ronnie Bennett, co-owner of the Broughton Street Cafe in Orangeburg County, told the BBC: ""If Biden has put money into black communities, I don't see it."" Ms Bennett plans to vote for Joe Biden again but mostly out of obligation, feeling Democrats offer her the most hope. ""Our ancestors fought for the right to vote, so we exercise that right whether we like who's running or not,"" she says. Her shop is located in Orangeburg's downtown historic district, less than a mile away from SCSU. Deserted sidewalks, boarded windows and crumbling buildings hug the downtown streets, save for a scant number of new businesses like Bennett's. The cafe's freshly painted exterior and colourful wood-warmed interior injected vibrancy into the neighbourhood when it opened in 2022, but little has come after, Bennett says. Others are eager to support Mr Biden, alarmed by the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Cecil Williams is the owner of the South Carolina Civil Rights Museum, where relics from one of the darkest chapters in American history are showcased. Inside, an original copy of The Clansman - the early 20th Century novel glamourising the Ku Klux Klan - sits just feet away from emptied shotgun shells used by police to kill unarmed black student protestors on SCSU's campus. The museum's artefacts are relics of a racist past that Williams fears Donald Trump is rekindling. The former president has faced accusations of racism - which he denies - including for pushing the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in America and for telling four minority congresswoman to ""go back"" to where they came from. ""We need someone like Joe Biden in the White House now more than ever. Just look at the alternative,"" Williams says. ""If we stay home, we lose this election. We can't let that happen."" But as Mr Trump seeks the presidency for a third time, he'll be looking to take advantage of Democrats' shrinking stronghold on black voters. ""That's just an opportunity that we would be remiss if we didn't exploit,"" a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said, according to the Associated Press. In addition to multiple celebrity endorsements from rappers like Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, Mr Trump has increasingly positioned himself on camera with his now-defeated opponent, Tim Scott. Mr Scott, South Carolina's first black US senator, has been widely discussed as a possible vice-presidential pick for Mr Trump. It's an idea Mr Scott seems to be courting. ""I just love you"", he told the former president from the stage after Mr Trump's latest victory in the Republican race. In Winnsboro, where the population barely nudges above 3,000, and the fried chicken gets served at the gas station, voter frustration is not hard to find. There's a barbershop on the town's main street, one of few businesses not permanently closed. Clarence Pauling, the shop's owner, has a quick response for anyone who asks him what he thinks of President Biden: ""I'll never vote for Biden again."" The proposition itself sparks a stir in the small black-owned business. ""Yes Lord!"" one man shouted, listening in while getting his hair cut. ""Giving all that money to Ukraine. You got people right here that need it. We got homeless people sleeping at the bus stop."" Mr Pauling, 49, historically has been a staunch Democratic supporter and says he even used his barbershop to register voters to support Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 elections. But not this year. He's strongly considering voting for Donald Trump, a desired change of pace from Mr Biden who he says ""talks a good game, but doesn't deliver"". Others in the barbershop agree and express frustration with the cost of gas and groceries. ""Trump tells the truth,"" says Pauling, laughing as he recalled when Mr Trump frankly told Hillary Clinton that he uses the ""rigged system"" to his advantage. ""I can dig that. I'm tired of everybody trying to be politically correct,"" he said. ""Tell it like it is."" Donald Trump is set to soon clinch the Republican nomination. Potential running mates are lining up. The Christian church, known as The Truth, has been recently rocked by a sexual abuse scandal. Audrii Cunningham's body was recovered a week after she went missing from near her family home in Texas. Dr Matthew Knowles says his daughter was inspired by her grandfather's favourite country music as a child. A woman who shot to fame giving parenting advice has been jailed for at least four years for child abuse. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,,Opinion President Biden should not run again in 2024,                ,www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/12/biden-trump-election-step-aside/,
,,Behind Biden’s 2020 Victory,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  Note (July 2023): A new report about the 2022 validated voters used slightly revised 2020 estimates. There was nothing inaccurate about the 2020 results, but we chose to use a slightly different survey weighting approach that increases the precision of our estimates. None of the substantive findings from the 2020 report have been impacted. See the 2022 methodology for more detail.    The 2020 presidential election was historic in many ways. Amid a global pandemic, with unprecedented changes in how Americans voted, voter turnout rose 7 percentage points over 2016, resulting in a total of 66% of U.S. adult citizens casting a ballot in the 2020 election. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote. While Biden’s popular vote differential was an improvement over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 2-point advantage, it was not as resounding as congressional Democrats’ 9-point advantage over Republicans in votes cast in the 2018 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel were matched to public voting records from three national commercial voter files in an attempt to find a record for voting in the 2020 election. Validated voters are citizens who told us in a post-election survey that they voted in the 2020 general election and have a record for voting in a commercial voter file. Nonvoters are citizens who were not found to have a record of voting in any of the voter files or told us they did not vote. A new analysis of validated 2020 voters from Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel examines change and continuity in the electorate, both of which contributed to Biden’s victory. It looks at how new voters and voters who turned out in one or both previous elections voted in the 2020 presidential election and offers a detailed portrait of the demographic composition and vote choices of the 2020 electorate. It also provides a comparison with findings from our previous studies of the 2016 and 2018 electorates. A number of factors determined the composition of the 2020 electorate and explain how it delivered Biden a victory. Among those who voted for Clinton and Trump in 2016, similar shares of each – about nine-in-ten – also turned out in 2020, and the vast majority remained loyal to the same party in the 2020 presidential contest. These voters formed substantial bases of support for both Biden and Trump. Overall, there were shifts in presidential candidate support among some key groups between 2016 and 2020, notably suburban voters and independents. On balance, these shifts helped Biden a little more than Trump. Overall, one-in-four 2020 voters (25%) had not voted in 2016. About a quarter of these (6% of all 2020 voters) showed up two years later – in 2018 – to cast ballots in the highest-turnout midterm election in decades. Those who voted in 2018 but not in 2016 backed Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by about two-to-one (62% to 36%). Both Trump and Biden were able to bring new voters into the political process in 2020. The 19% of 2020 voters who did not vote in 2016 or 2018 split roughly evenly between the two candidates (49% Biden vs. 47% Trump). However, as with voters overall, there was a substantial age divide within this group. Among those under age 30 who voted in 2020 but not in either of the two previous elections, Biden led 59% to 33%, while Trump won among new or irregular voters ages 30 and older by 55% to 42%. Younger voters also made up an outsize share of these voters: Those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular 2020 voters, though they represented just 15% of all 2020 voters. One somewhat unusual aspect of the 2016 election was the relatively high share of voters (nearly 6%) who voted for one of the third-party candidates (mostly the Libertarian and Green Party nominees), a fact many observers attributed to the relative unpopularity of both major party candidates. By comparison, just 2% of voters chose a third-party candidate in 2020. Overall, third-party 2016 voters who turned out in 2020 voted 53%-36% for Biden over Trump, with 10% opting for a third-party candidate. Among the 5% of Republicans who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, a majority (70%) supported Trump in 2020, but 18% backed Biden. Among the 5% of Democrats who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, just 8% supported Trump in 2020 while 85% voted for Biden. Here are some of the other key findings from the analysis: This analysis is based on a survey of 11,818 members of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel conducted Nov. 12-17, 2020, shortly after the general election. It also draws on surveys conducted among 10,640 panelists from Nov. 7-16, 2018, after the midterm election that year and 4,183 panelists from Nov. 29 to Dec. 12, 2016, after the general election. Researchers attempted to match the panelists to three different commercial voter files that contain official records of voter registration and turnout for 2016, 2018 and 2020. (For more details, see Methodology.) This study marries official turnout records with a post-election survey among a large, ongoing survey panel, with the goal of improving the accuracy of the results compared with relying on self-reported turnout alone. The survey panel also makes it possible to examine change in turnout and vote preference over time among many of the same individuals. This analysis joins a growing body of research seeking to achieve a more accurate assessment of the 2020 election, each based on somewhat different sources of data.2 Different methods and data sources have unique strengths and weaknesses, meaning that specific estimates are likely to vary among the studies and no single resource can be considered definitive. The 2020 election featured continuity in the voting patterns of major demographic and political groups in the population, but there were a few important shifts. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 as Democrats made gains among men and Republicans made gains among women. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won men by 11 percentage points (52% to 41%) while Hillary Clinton won women by 15 points (54% to 39%). In the 2018 election, Democrats substantially narrowed the gap with men (50% of men voted for Democratic candidates, 48% for Republican candidates) while maintaining an 18-point lead among women. In the 2020 election, men again divided nearly evenly (50% Trump, 48% Biden), while Biden’s advantage narrowed to 11 points among women (55% to 44%). Similarly, as Biden increased his level of support among White men in the 2020 election relative to Clinton’s in 2016, Trump gained among White women, which had the effect of further narrowing the gender gap among White voters. In 2016, Trump won White men by 30 points (62% to 32%). That gap narrowed to a 17-point margin for Trump in 2020 (57% to 40%). White women, a group sometimes categorized as swing voters and who broke nearly evenly in 2016 (47% for Trump to 45% for Clinton), favored him in 2020 (53% to 46%). Biden received the support of 92% of Black voters, nearly the same as Clinton received in 2016 and Democratic candidates for the U.S. House received in 2018. While Biden took a 59% majority of the Hispanic vote, Trump (with 38%) gained significantly over the level of support Republican candidates for the House received in 2018 (25%). To be sure, Hispanic voters are not a monolith; there is substantial diversity within the Hispanic electorate. One noteworthy feature of the 2020 election was the wide education gap among Hispanic voters. In 2020, Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30%. At the same time, Biden’s advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters who did not have a college degree was far narrower (55% to 41%). One of the most pivotal groups in the 2016 election was White voters without a four-year college degree, who were critical to Trump’s electoral college victory that year (nationally, he won them by a wide 36-point margin in 2016, 64% to 28%). Prior to 2016, differences in candidate preferences by education were typically much smaller than they were that year. In 2020, Trump won 65% of White non-college voters – nearly identical to his 2016 share – even as Biden outperformed Clinton among this group (33% of White non-college voters backed Biden, up from the 28% of this group Clinton won in 2016). At the same time, White voters with a college degree or higher supported Biden by roughly the same margin they had backed Clinton in 2016. Trump’s stronghold among White men without a four-year college degree loosened somewhat in 2020. While he still won this group by a little more than two-to one (66% to Biden’s 31%), that 35 percentage point gap is notably smaller than the 50-point gap in the 2016 election, when 73% of White men without a college degree supported Trump, compared with 23% who supported Clinton. Meanwhile, White men with a four-year college degree have become increasingly supportive of Democratic candidates, breaking close to evenly in 2016 (47% for Clinton, 44% for Trump) but supporting Biden by a 10-point margin in 2020. At the same time, Trump’s vote share among White women without a college degree grew slightly between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. In 2016, White, non-college women supported Trump by a margin of 56% to 33%. By 2020, Trump’s vote share rose to 64% among this group compared with 35% supporting Biden. Among white women with a college degree, support for Biden was on par with support for Clinton in 2016 (59%-40% in 2020). Biden and Trump benefited from similar levels of party loyalty in 2020, with Trump receiving 92% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Biden getting 94% among Democrats and Democratic leaners. Comparable levels of support for each candidate were seen among Democrats (95% for Biden) and Republicans (94% for Trump), not including leaners. Among independents and those who affiliated with other parties, Biden led Trump by 52%-43%. Ideological divisions within the parties were also apparent in the vote, with both Trump and Biden doing better among the ideological core of their parties. Trump received the votes of 97% of conservative Republicans and leaners but a smaller majority (79%) of Republicans who describe themselves as moderate or liberal. Biden took 98% of the vote among liberal Democrats and leaners and 91% among those who are moderate or conservative. A yawning age gap in voter support – a pattern that emerged in the 2004 presidential election for the first time since 1972 – continues to be evident, with voters under 30 favoring Joe Biden by 24 percentage points (Biden 59%, Trump 35%). Perhaps reflecting the enduring impact of this long-term age gap, voters ages 30 to 49 were also solidly in the Democratic candidate’s camp in 2020, favoring Biden by 12 points (55%-43%), similar to Clinton’s share among this age group. By contrast, older age groups divided fairly evenly between Biden and Trump, a result not too different from 2016. These patterns also are apparent when the lens is shifted to birth cohorts, or generations – groups of voters who share birth years and perhaps formative political experiences in common, such as the popularity of the president at the time they were first eligible to vote. Voters in the youngest adult generations today – Generation Z (those ages 18 to 23 in 2020) and the Millennial generation (ages 24 to 39 in 2020) – favored Biden over Trump by a margin of 20 percentage points, though Trump gained 8 points among Millennials compared with his 2016 performance. Generation Xers, those ages 40 to 55 in 2020, divided relatively evenly (51% to 48%), as did Baby Boomers. Only among members of the Silent Generation, ages 75 to 92 in 2020, was Trump clearly favored (by 58%-42%). Notably, Boomers and Silents (and the very small number of voters from the Greatest Generation) made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%), compared with just over half in both 2016 and 2018. The political split between America’s rural areas and its suburban and urban locales remained substantial in 2020. Biden did considerably better among suburban voters in 2020 than Clinton did in 2016 (54% for Biden, 45% for Clinton). By contrast, Trump garnered the support of 65% of rural voters, including 71% of White rural voters; the latter represented an increase over the 62% he received among this group in 2016. Biden received a solid majority of votes among urban residents (66% overall), but Trump gained among urbanites relative to his performance in 2016 (33% in 2020, 24% in 2016). Voters in 2020 sorted along religious lines in ways consistent with recent elections. Protestants constituted nearly half of all voters (46%), as they did in 2016. Within the Protestant tradition, White evangelicals accounted for 19% of all voters, but a much higher share of Trump’s voters (34%). Without such broad support for Trump among White evangelicals, Biden would have beaten him by more than 20 points. White non-evangelical Protestants voted for Trump over Biden by a 14-point margin (57%-43%), while Black Protestants were an overwhelmingly Democratic group (91% voted for Biden). Biden, by contrast, drew strong support from religiously unaffiliated voters – atheists, agnostics, and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular.” Together, these voters made up 25% of voters, which is a slightly larger share of the total electorate than White evangelicals (19%). But support for Biden among the unaffiliated was not quite as lopsided as Trump’s support among White evangelicals (a 45-point margin for Biden among the unaffiliated vs. a 69-point margin for Trump among White evangelicals). Without the religiously unaffiliated, Trump would have had a 9-point popular vote margin over Biden. White non-Hispanic Catholics were more supportive of Biden (at 42%) than they had been of Clinton in 2016 (31%), but Trump still captured a solid majority of their votes (57%). White Catholics made up 14% of all voters. As was the case in the 2016 and 2018 elections, the Democratic voting coalition in 2020 looked quite different from the Republican coalition in several respects. Overall, Biden voters were younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and less likely to live in rural areas than Trump voters. In 2020, 85% of voters who cast a ballot for Trump were White non-Hispanic; this compares with just 61% of Biden voters. These differences are roughly consistent with the share of White voters in each party’s coalition in 2016. Nearly two-in-ten voters who cast a ballot for Biden in the 2020 election (19%) were Black, identical to the share of Clinton voters in 2016 who were Black. That is significantly higher than the share of Trump voters who were Black (2%). The community profiles of Trump and Biden voters are similar in some fundamental ways to the previous two elections – but more voters who cast ballots for Biden in 2020 say they live in a suburban area compared with Clinton’s 2016 voters. Overall, urban voters continue to constitute a larger share of the Democratic coalition compared with the Republican coalition. And rural voters remain a significantly larger portion of the Republican electorate. However, when comparing Clinton’s voters with Biden’s, there are some significant shifts. In 2016, about half of Clinton’s voters described their communities as suburban (48%), while 32% said they were from an urban area and 19% were from a rural area. In 2020, suburban voters made up a majority of Biden’s coalition (55%); 28% of his voters said they lived in urban areas and 17% were from rural areas. In 2020, 31% of Trump voters had at least a four-year college degree – similar to the share of Trump voters who had a college degree in 2016. Far more Trump voters (roughly 70% in each presidential election) did not have a four-year college degree. The Democratic electorate is more evenly divided when it comes to education. In 2020, 46% of Biden voters had at least a college degree; 53% did not have a degree. As was the case in 2016, White voters without a four-year college degree made up a considerably larger share of GOP voters (58%) than Democratic voters (27%). At the same time, White voters with a college degree made up a larger share of Biden voters (34%) than Trump voters (27%). In 2020, the age profiles of Democratic and Republican voters looked largely similar to 2016. Younger adults continue to make up a larger share of Democratic voters compared with Republican voters. For example, in 2020, nearly half of Biden voters (49%) were younger than 50; that compares with 39% of Trump voters in 2020. Protestants made up a majority of those voting Republican in 2020, just as they did in 2016. Overall, 58% of Trump voters were Protestant, compared with just 35% of Biden voters. White evangelical Protestants, in particular, remained a critical part of the Republican voting coalition, making up 34% of Trump’s voters but just 6% of Biden’s. Catholics made up similar shares of Biden and Trump voters (19% and 22%, respectively); in 2016, Catholics made up a slightly higher share of Trump voters compared with Clinton voters (23% vs. 18%). Voters who were unaffiliated with any religious tradition (atheists, agnostics and those who describe themselves as “nothing in particular”) made up 35% of Biden voters but just 14% of Trump voters in 2020. The 2020 election brought a huge change in howAmericans cast their ballots. As some states looked to adapt to challenges in administering elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters were offered expanded access to absentee and vote-by-mail options in the 2020 election. As a result, a record number of voters said they cast their ballots this way (46%). And smaller shares of voters said they either voted in person on Election Day (27%) or in person before Election Day (27%). A majority of absentee voters said they had previously voted this way before the 2020 election (56%). Still, a sizable share (43%) said the November election was the first time they had cast an absentee or mail ballot. Sizable shares of voters across racial and ethnic subgroups cast absentee or mail-in ballots in the 2020 election – though there are some differences in voting methods when comparing across groups. White voters were most likely to say they voted in person on Election Day (30%). Comparably smaller shares of Black (20%) and Hispanic voters (18%) said the same. Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to say they cast their ballot in person before Election Day (42% of Black voters, vs. 27% of Hispanic voters and 25% of White voters). Voters ages 65 and older stand out in their voting behavior: 55% say they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election – 13 percentage points higher than the share of adults under 65 who cast a ballot by mail. Urban and suburban voters were considerably more likely than rural voters to say they cast their ballot by mail (50% of urban and suburban vs. 35% of rural voters). In contrast, rural voters were more likely to report voting in person on Election Day. A majority of Biden voters said they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election (58%). By contrast, about a third of Trump voters (32%) voted by mail. Roughly two-thirds of Trump voters (68%) said they voted in person, either on (38%) or before (30%) Election Day.  Reflecting these differences, Trump performed much better among voters who cast their ballots in person on Election Day (65% for Trump vs. 33% for Biden). These shares were reversed among absentee and mail-in voters: 65% of absentee voters said they voted for Biden, compared with 33% who voted for Trump. Preferences were more evenly divided among those who cast their ballots in person ahead of Election Day: 52% voted for Trump while 47% voted for Biden. The 2020 general election featured the highest rate of voter turnout in more than a century, with 66% of eligible adults casting a ballot for president. All members of the American Trends Panel who took the 2020 post-election survey – whether they voted or not – were asked which candidate they preferred in the race for president. Nonvoters – citizens for whom no record of turnout could be located or who told us they did not vote – preferred Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 15 percentage points, 50% to 35%, compared with Biden’s 4-point overall advantage among voters. Voters were nearly evenly divided on party affiliation, with 50% identifying or leaning Democratic and 48% identifying or leaning Republican, similar to the 51%-48% split in 2016. Nonvoters in 2020 were more closely divided on partisanship than they were in 2016. Among nonvoters in 2020, 46% were Democrats or leaned Democratic, while 41% were Republicans or leaned Republican. A majority of nonvoters in 2016 (55%) were Democrats or Democratic leaners, compared with about four-in-ten (41%) who were Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Despite notable changes in the demographics of the two candidates’ coalitions, the demographic composition of the electorate as a whole in 2020 did not differ much from that of 2016. Although turnout was strong, stark demographic differences between voters and nonvoters similar to those seen in past U.S. elections were present in 2020, a pattern familiar to political observers. Voters as a group were considerably older than nonvoters. Adults younger than 50 made up 45% of all voters but 68% of nonvoters – nearly identical to the pattern seen in 2016. But generational change in the electorate was quite apparent. Very few members of Gen Z (born 1997 and later) were eligible to vote in the 2016 electorate, and they made up just 1% of all voters that year. In 2020, they were 8% of the total, though their lower rate of turnout compared with older age cohorts is reflected in the fact that they were 15% of eligible nonvoters. At the other end of the generational spectrum, members of the Silent and Greatest generations (born 1945 and earlier) fell from 16% of all voters in 2016 to just 8% in 2020, but their turnout rates remained among the highest of all generations.  Turnout differences by race and ethnicity persisted as well. White non-Hispanic adults were 72% of voters in 2020 but just 55% of nonvoting citizens. Black Americans made up 11% of voters, but a slightly larger share (14%) of nonvoting citizens, and Hispanic adults were 10% of voters but 20% of nonvoting citizens. Asian Americans (a relatively small but fast-growing group in the U.S.) made up 4% of voters and an identical share of nonvoting citizens (note: nonvoters in this analysis do not include noncitizens). Some of the largest differences between voters and nonvoters are seen on education and income. College graduates made up 39% of all voters in 2020 (about the same as in 2016) but only 17% of nonvoters. Adults with a high school education or less were 29% of all voters but half of nonvoters.

,,A deepfake ‘Joe Biden’ robocall told voters to stay home for primary election,"An AI vocal clone confused New Hampshire residents ahead of first-in-the-nation primary. BY ANDREW PAUL | PUBLISHED JAN 22, 2024 3:56 PM EST AI vocal cloning technology is reportedly already muddying the waters ahead of the 2024 election. According to a statement issued by the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday, a robocall campaign deployed over the weekend used an imitation of President Joe Biden’s voice to urge recipients not to vote in the state’s January 23 presidential primary. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” an AI-generated Biden told residents over the phone. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” The disinformation campaign’s orchestrators are currently unknown, but it comes from “obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden,” according to former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan, speaking through NBC News’ initial exclusive report. [Related: Deepfake audio already fools people nearly 25 percent of the time.] AI-generated content including deepfaked audio, video, and imagery is a growing concern among misinformation experts. Multiple reports have warned that today’s media, internet, and social landscapes are unprepared for a likely imminent deluge of falsified “fake news” content as the 2024 presidential election intensifies. A recent study conducted by researchers at the UK’s University College London indicates AI generated audio can fool as many as 1-in-4 listeners. Over 1,600 videos uploaded to YouTube have featured deepfaked celebrities like Taylor Swift and Steve Harvey hawking “medical card” schemes and other scams, collectively amassing over 195 million views in the process. But unlike “free money” ploys from AI Oprah, the latest vocal cloning example is explicitly meant to influence the US political landscape. As for this weekend’s misinfo campaign, the fake Biden falsely claimed an ongoing statewide campaign to write-in his name during New Hampshire’s primary would hurt the president’s reelection prospects. The robocall message then concluded with a phone number linked to Kathy Sullivan, resulting in a flurry of calls on Sunday evening that prompted the former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair to report the situation to the state attorney general’s office. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters,” the state attorney general’s office cautioned in Monday’s statement. Voters were urged to disregard the message, with the office explicitly making clear, “Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election.” [Related: Beware the AI celebrity clones peddling bogus ‘free money’ on YouTube.] Representatives of former President Trump’s campaign have denied any connection to the robocall scheme. Meanwhile a spokesperson for Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota challenging Biden for the Democratic Party nomination, described the scam as “wildly concerning.” “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Phillips campaign representative Katie Dolan told NBC News. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.” At least some Phillips supporters, however, are embracing other AI tool tactics, despite warnings to the contrary. Late last week, The Washington Post noted that Dean.Bot—a chatbot created by a pro-Phillips SuperPAC—had been removed from OpenAI’s recently launched online store for “knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning.” Despite the slap on the wrist, Phillips remains a favorite of some Silicon Valley’s top players. The SuperPAC behind Dean.Bot, We Deserve Better, was co-founded by the former chief of staff for Sam Altman, OpenAI co-founder and recently fired-and-rehired CEO. Altman himself has met with Phillips, although he has yet to endorse or formally donate to the congressman’s campaign. The New Hampshire AG’s statement notes a Department of Justice investigation into the AI presidential robocall is ongoing, and encourages residents to contact the Election Law Unit if they received a message beginning with AI Biden opining, “What a bunch of malarkey.” Andrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.

,,"Tlaib, only Pales­tinian American in Congress, urges Michigan Democrats to vote against Biden in primary","       Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, urged Democrats in her state to vote against President Joe Biden in the Feb. 27 primary, citing his support of Israel as they wage war with Hamas in Gaza. She urged her fellow Democrats to instead vote “uncommitted” to protest the president in a video posted over the weekend by Listen to Michigan, a campaign run by her sister opposing “war and genocide in Gaza.” More than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday. The war began when 1,200 were killed and 250 were taken hostage during an Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. “This is the way you can raise our voices. Don't make us even more invisible. Right now we feel completely neglected and just unseen by our government,” Tlaib said outside a civic center in Dearborn, Mich., on Saturday. Over half of the city’s 110,000 people are of Arab descent, according to the U.S. Census. “If you want us to be louder, then come here and vote ‘uncommitted.’” Michigan’s primary is not until the end of the month, but early voting began on Saturday and runs through Feb. 25. On the Democratic ballot, Biden faces only Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, whose campaign has floundered, and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, who has dropped out. The president has cruised through the handful of primary contests so far, with little expected to disrupt his path to the nomination. But the call to vote “uncommitted,” an option in Michigan, comes as Biden faces criticism from some corners of his own party, including Muslim and Arab Americans, that his Israel policy is failing to reign in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his bombardment of Gaza. The Biden administration has pushed back on Israel’s planned ground attack on Rafah, a city in Gaza’s south where around 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have congregated as 80% of their homes have been destroyed, according to U.N. officials Despite a growing public gap between Biden and Netanyahu, the president is pushing for billions in military aid for Israel, as well as funds for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. For Tlaib and others who share her views, including antiwar protestors who have disrupted speeches by the president and other politicians across the country in recent months, continuing to enable and support Israel’s war effort is tantamount to assisting genocide. “As important, as you all know, to not only march against the genocide, not only make sure that we're calling our members of Congress and local electeds and patting passing city resolutions, all throughout our country, it is also important to create a voting bloc, something that is a bullhorn to say, enough is enough,” Tlaib said on Saturday. “We don't want a country that supports wars and bombs and destruction. We want to support life. We want to stand up for every single life killed in Gaza.” Tlaib is not alone among prominent Michigan Democrats who have backed the “uncommitted” campaign. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, former Michigan Rep. Andy Levin and a slew of state and local officials have all signed on to vote “uncommitted.” Our Revolution, the political organization founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, I-Vt., has also endorsed the campaign, along with a Detroit chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Sanders himself has declined to describe the conflict as a genocide and remains a vocal supporter of Biden. The Listen to Michigan website notes Trump won the state by just 10,000 votes in 2016. Biden won by around 154,000 votes in 2020. “Don't stay home, come out and tell the president you're mad at him,” Levin said on MSNBC’s “Ayman” on Sunday. “There's eight months left or something like that until Nov. 5, let's send a message to the president, that if you change course, which you must do for for justice, then I think that people will return to him” Hammoud and other local Arab-American leaders canceled a meeting with Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez in January over his disagreement with the president’s policies. Earlier this month, he instead met with members of the administration. “I firmly believe that it’s always the right time to do the right thing. And in this moment the right thing here is calling for a cease-fire, it’s restricting military aid and support to Benjamin Netanyahu and the most right-wing government in Israel’s history,” Hammoud said on Al Jazeera English’s “UpFront” last week. “I think these are tangible steps that can be taken to demonstrate good faith to a community in which you want to build support for the upcoming election. I think anything else is unacceptable.” “Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy. I recognize this. Many in the community recognize this in the upcoming election,” he continued, asking what will Biden do “to prevent the unraveling of this American democracy and why is the alignment with Benjamin Netanyahu potentially worth sacrificing that democracy. Earlier this month, the mayor announced an increased police presence at places of worship and “major infrastructure” after an influx of “bigoted and Islamaphobic rhetoric online targeting the city.” Hammoud blamed the attacks on a Wall Street Journal op-ed dubbing the city “America’s Jihad Capital.” Other major Michigan Democrats are backing the president, including the popular Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and both of the state’s senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters. But an AP-NORC poll from earlier this month showed two-thirds of U.S. adults and a majority of Democrats disapprove of Biden’s handling of the war, his lowest marks since it began. After running roughly even with former President Donald Trump in Michigan polls in the fall, Biden has consistently found himself down against his 2020 rival in general election polls there over the last couple months. Tlaib, one of the first two Muslim congresswomen in U.S. history, represents Dearborn and other communities in and around Detroit with large populations of Muslim and Arab Americans. Members of those communities in Michigan and in key swing states throughout the country have organized “Abandon Biden” efforts to foil the president’s reelection bid, not out of support for Trump, but to push Democrats to change their positions on Israel and the war in Gaza. Tlaib has not publicly endorsed the campaign. “President Biden has sent thousands of bombs to Israel’s military, while blocking international efforts to stop the violence and watering down attempts to secure sufficient humanitarian aid,” Tlaib wrote in a Feb. 14 email for the progressive group Justice Democrats, calling for signatures to petition demanding Biden “facilitate an immediate ceasefire” and affirm the U.N.’s International Court of Justice order last month that Israel do all it can to prevent death and acts of genocide.  “As the biggest funder of Israel’s military, U.S. government leaders have the power and the obligation to stop this unfolding genocide,” she added in the email. On Monday, the Biden administration countered an Algerian resolution at the U.N. that would call for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire with a proposal of their own, according to the Associated Press: a temporary, six-week cease-fire deal enacted “as soon as practicable” and dependent on Hamas’ release of some 130 of their remaining hostages, many of which are presumed dead. It would also condemn the planned offensive on Gaza and warn against the displacement of civilians into other countries like Egypt. A vote on the Algerian resolution, backed by 22 Arab nations and many other nations, is expected Tuesday morning. Beyond the U.N., negotiations between the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt have not been fruitful in recent weeks, according to negotiators. The “uncommitted” effort in Michigan is not the first time Tlaib has condemned Biden for his policies, writing he “supported the genocide of the Palestinian people” in a video she posted on social media on Nov. 3, 2023. She’s remained a consistent critic and opponent of the president’s agenda since. “Biden, support a ceasefire now,” a caption on the video read. “Or don’t count on us in 2024.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

,,"""Who's paying for it?"": Fake Biden robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home","Help keep Salon independent A fake robocall purporting to be from President Joe Biden targeted New Hampshire voters, telling them to stay away from the polls in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday, per NBC News.  The New Hampshire attorney general was prompted to look into the matter after Kathy Sullivan, a top New Hampshire Democrat who runs a super PAC that urges Democrats in her state to write in Biden's name in the primary, filed a complaint. NBC reported that Sullivan's personal cell phone number appeared in the caller ID of those receiving the robocall.  “What a bunch of malarkey,” the phony message begins, citing an oft-used phrase by Biden. The message adds that “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election.” “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” the message says. ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement.

,,Biden wants to win over young voters. They want him to do more about climate change,"Mara Liasson President Biden is grappling with how to convince young voters to support him. Climate and the pushback around him skipping COP28 is one example.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to the international climate summit known as COP28 in Dubai this weekend. The White House says President Joe Biden asked Harris to go to emphasize the importance of the conference and to showcase U.S. leadership on climate at home and abroad. But young people in particular have been pushing Biden to do more when it comes to climate. They have been calling for Biden himself to attend the global meeting. Here to talk about the politics around all of this is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Juana. SUMMERS: So Mara, why is the question of who will attend this summit so significant? LIASSON: Well, first of all, the purpose of the summit is to see if these big fossil fuel-consuming countries can meet their promises to keep the Earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Politically, who goes for the United States is important because this is an example of the difficulty Biden has had with young voters. Young people care very deeply about climate, about the state of the Earth that they're going to inherit, and the White House was feeling the pressure. A source familiar with the plans to send the vice president told our colleague Deepa Shivaram that that pressure made them decide to send Vice President Harris. So climate was a big part of Biden's campaign for president in 2020. He's taken some big actions related to climate change since then. He's in Colorado today actually talking about wind power. The Inflation Reduction Act that he signed put huge investments into climate policy - $370 billion. He doesn't get a whole lot of credit for that. But young voters want him to do more. They want him to solve problems and not just on climate. They want the high cost of housing addressed. They want the Israeli-Hamas war to be ended. They want student loan forgiveness. And they're frustrated that Biden can't do more. SUMMERS: I want to stick with the war here for a second because that is an area that has been another really big disconnect between the administration and young voters, right? LIASSON: Absolutely. The war in the Middle East is a motivating issue for young voters, young people right now. This is one place where Biden and young people pushing for an end to Israel's military actions are actually at odds. On climate, they agree. They just think Biden should be doing more. The Middle East is where there is a real policy difference between young voters, between voters of color - very important parts of the Democratic base - and the Biden administration. Whether this issue will hurt Biden next year depends on how long the Hamas-Israeli war lasts. But right now, it's showing some deep rifts inside the Democratic Party which could be a real problem for Biden. Now, climate is not going away. It's going to be an issue now. It's going to be an issue next year. We'll have to see how big of an impact it has on motivating young people to either vote for Biden, stay home or find a third party alternative. SUMMERS: OK, back to the summit. Vice President Harris is going to go. What has her role been in engaging with these young voters that the administration needs? LIASSON: The White House has used her as an ambassador to young voters, to the Democratic base, on a whole lot of issues. She's gone on the road. She's talked on college campuses about climate change, about abortion, about gun laws. It hasn't all been smooth for her. At one of her last stops, protesters were shouting about the administration's approach to Gaza. But it's just not clear if Harris is going to be the person to galvanize the youth vote. SUMMERS: I mean, young people were a huge part of the Biden coalition in 2020, as you know well. What does it mean in 2024 if they do not show up and vote? LIASSON: It means there's a huge problem for Joe Biden. This is really important. He is not at risk of losing young voters to Trump. He's at risk of young voters not being enthusiastic. This is going to be a close election, a turnout election. Biden needs every single base Democratic voter to show up at the polls. We know from polling that Republicans are already more enthusiastic about voting in 2024 than Democrats are, so Biden can't afford any apathy among his supporters. And, you know, having a voter who stays home or votes for a third party is really the same thing as losing a vote to Trump because the person who gets a plurality of votes in states is the one who wins all the electors. That's our system. It's not a popular vote system. That's why turnout and enthusiasm really matters. SUMMERS: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you as always.

,,,"Joe Biden and Donald Trump. (AFP/Getty Images via CNN Newsource) (CNN) — President Joe Biden’s political operation has expanded its financial advantage over former President Donald Trump’s campaign as the two men hurtle toward an expected general election confrontation, new filings show. Biden’s campaign entered February with nearly $56 million cash reserves in his main campaign committee compared to a little more than $30 million in the coffers of Trump’s equivalent account. That’s an increase from the $46 million the president had stockpiled at the end of last year, while Trump’s cash position shrank from the $33 million his campaign had reported at the close of 2023. Biden’s early money lead could prove consequential in what’s expected to be a close and bruising campaign with both candidates unpopular with the broader electorate. Biden, who is on a fundraising swing in California, continues to rake in high-dollar contributions as Trump grapples with ever-growing legal problems that are siphoning away donors’ money. The former president is also contending with the refusal of his remaining rival, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, to end her long-shot bid for the GOP nomination. Haley, who is vowing to remain in the race to Super Tuesday, started February with just shy of $13 million in cash reserves after spending more than she raised in January, new filings show. Here are key takeaways from Tuesday’s campaign filings: Early Advantage for Biden Incumbent presidents typically hold a fundraising advantage, and Biden’s political operation ended January in a strong financial position. It announced this week that it started February with $130 million cash on hand across all its aligned committees. (Tuesday’s filings cover only a portion of each presidential candidate’s political operation. The campaigns and national parties report fundraising totals on a monthly basis, but filings from joint fundraising committees – detailing their fundraising cash reserves – are not due until later this year.) The total Biden touts raising across his fundraising committees still trails what Trump and the Republican National Committee had built up by this point in 2020 – when he and his aligned committees reported more than $200 million in cash reserves. But Biden, as the sitting president in 2024, has the ability to raise money jointly with the national party and to stockpile cash for the expensive general election fight ahead. His West Coast fundraising tour was expected to bring in as much as $10 million. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez, in a statement this week, called the president’s haul “an indisputable show of strength to start the election year.” Asked for comment, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung on Wednesday pointed to polling to argue that the former president would prevail, saying that “voters are sick and tired of four years of misery and destruction.” Party Power The Democratic National Committee outraised its GOP counterpart in January, bringing in $17.4 million and ended the month with $24 million in available cash. That far surpasses the $8.7 million in available cash for the RNC, which marked a slight uptick from the $8 million it reported having in reserves at the end of last year, but still represents its lowest total in about a decade. The RNC brought in a total of about $11.6 million in January. The RNC’s low cash reserves have been a major source of concern for the party and contributed to the exit of outgoing chair Ronna McDaniel, who is planning on stepping down from her role later this month – part of sweeping changes coming to the RNC with Trump poised to reshape the party infrastructure. At $8.7 million, the RNC’s cash reserves remain the lowest it has reported since early 2015, and down significantly from a peak of more than $90 million as recently as 2021. Although Trump is the GOP front-runner, he still has yet to formally clinch the nomination and fuse his campaign apparatus with that of the RNC – a move that is expected to boost the party’s fundraising and will put Trump’s close allies in control of the committee’s operations and finances. Pro-Haley Super PAC Cash Dwindles SFA Fund, the lead super PAC supporting Haley’s presidential campaign, spent heavily in January and ended the month with just $1.9 million in cash on hand, a dwindling war chest as the former South Carolina governor vows to fight on. SFA Fund raised about $12.1 million in January – with several six-figure contributions coming from executives and financiers such as California-based venture capitalist Tim Draper, Arkansas investment banker Warren Stephens and New Balance honcho Jim Davis – and it spent nearly $13.7 million as the first presidential primary contests got underway. That left the group with just about $1.9 million in available cash entering February. SFA Fund has now reported spending nearly $80 million in total supporting Haley’s White House bid, a massive expenditure that still hasn’t managed to dent Trump’s commanding lead in the presidential primary. Despite the money spent, Haley hasn’t won any of the early-state contests. So far in February, the group has continued to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars each on dozens of pro-Haley independent expenditures, according to FEC filings, suggesting it has continued to receive donations. A spokesperson for the super PAC did not have any comment Tuesday evening. Haley has pledged to continue her campaign beyond Saturday’s primary in her home state, where polls show her trailing Trump by a wide margin. “I’m campaigning every day, until the last person votes,” she said Tuesday. In a new memo, two of Trump’s top advisers maintained that Haley has no path to the nomination and predicted the former president would secure the delegates needed to wrap up the GOP nomination contest next month. Trump’s Legal Payments Even as Trump racks up electoral victories in the early-voting states, the former president’s legal troubles grow. He now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties stemming from two recent civil fraud judgments in New York, on top of 91 criminal indictments across four jurisdictions. Trump’s first criminal trial, a hush money case in New York, is slated to begin March 25. Tuesday’s filings show that Trump’s leadership PAC paid out more than $2.9 million to law firms last month as his legal troubles mounted, and it ended January with an additional $1.9 million in unpaid legal bills. Last year alone, Save America spent more than $55 million on legal bills, accounting for nearly 85% of its spending. Trump’s political operation directs 10% of the money it raises online from his political supporters to Save America. As Trump’s legal bills have mounted, Save America also has reclaimed millions of dollars from a super PAC that was established to boost Trump’s White House bid. The super PAC, MAGA Inc., refunded $5 million to Save America last month, on top of $42.25 million it returned to Save America last year, records show. Trump has baselessly cast the legal troubles as part of a vast political witch hunt intended to disrupt his White House campaign. RFK Jr. Burns Through Cash Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is mounting an independent bid for the presidency, brought in nearly $2.7 million last month and burned through cash, spending more than $3.2 million, new filings show. He ended January with roughly $4.9 million remaining in the bank. The continued candidacy of this scion of one of the most storied families in Democratic politics has raised fears that his bid could siphon votes from Biden. American Values, a super PAC that is supporting Kennedy’s bid, has said it plans to spend up to $15 million to get him on the ballot in key states. And Tuesday’s filings show that one of the super PAC’s biggest backers remains Republican megadonor Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune. The Wyoming-based Mellon donated $5 million to the pro-Kennedy super PAC last month – more than half what the group raised in January. American Values ended the month with more than $23 million in available cash, a sizable war chest. Mellon also donated $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC last month.

,,Kasich can’t help Biden win over Republicans but Trump can,"COMMENTARY August 17, 2020 Campaigns & Elections Governance Studies Center for Effective Public Management On the night the 2020 Democratic National Convention kicked off, Democrats welcomed Republican speakers to the stage in an effort to lure GOP voters to cross the aisle in November. While crossover speakers at party conventions are quite common, Monday night’s Republican lineup—John Kasich, Susan Molinari, Meg Whitman and Christine Todd Whitman—was designed to show off the Democrats’ big-tent strategy. In addition to the Republicans were Senator Bernie Sanders, Michelle Obama, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. On Monday night the Biden campaign was trying to signal that all are welcome into the Democratic fold, and that opposition to Donald Trump does not mean their decision should be to stay home. Will it work? In any presidential election, there are voters who cross party lines. As the parties have become polarized and party affiliation and ideology have become largely synonymous, crossover voting in presidential elections has become much less frequent. For comparison, CNN’s 2016 exit polls show that only 8% of Democrats voted for Donald Trump and 8% of Republicans voted for Hillary Clinton. Despite Mr. Trump’s insistence that his support within the Republican Party is 96%, that claim is simply not true. Past polling has shown that there are a small percentage of people who continue to identify as Republicans who disapprove of President Trump, but that the number may be higher this year. Between June and August, surveys from The Economist/YouGov in the first week of each month showed Republicans’ approval hovering around 85%, with Republicans’ disapproval between 14-15%. There is some ground for Mr. Biden to take a larger percentage of Republicans in 2020 than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Yet, it is hard to imagine that Monday night’s speakers will do the trick and move voters who are on the fence. One of those speakers is a former Ohio governor and another is a former New York congresswoman who hasn’t served in the House since the mid-1990s. Republicans likely have a firm idea of whether they support or oppose President Trump, and a Republican endorsement of Biden likely will not affect that decision. At the same time, President Trump has easy ammunition to criticize Monday night’s speakers, claiming that John Kasich—who Mr. Trump beat in the 2016 presidential primary—and Meg Whitman—who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016—are not real Republicans. Another group of voters getting attention from media—beyond Republicans looking to vote across party lines—are former Republicans who now identify as independents or as Democrats. Those former Republicans surely exist, including media personalities like MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough (who has renounced his GOP affiliation) and the Republicans who started the TV-savvy, anti-Trump political action committee The Lincoln Project. Yet, Gallup polling shows that the percentage of the public that self-identifies as a Republican has held stable since Donald Trump was elected president. That number was 28% both in December 2016 and July 2020, and thus, former Republicans are few in number. For both groups—former Republicans and Republicans who oppose the president—their choice is not between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Their choice is between Joe Biden and staying home. These voters know who Donald Trump is, and they don’t care for what they see. These voters want to hear better policies, ideas, and vision. They also want to see in Mr. Biden a type of leadership they believe America should have, but they do not think America currently has. They know they will not agree with the former vice president on everything, but it is Mr. Biden who must convince him he is the safer bet. And in fact, to convey that “safety,” another group of elected officials may actually play an even stronger role in demonstrating to Republicans and former Republicans why Joe Biden is a safe bet: moderate Democrats. Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) [who spoke Monday night] and Reps. Collin Peterson (Minn.) and Joe Cunningham (S.C.) can present themselves as moderate legislators who will not give Joe Biden a blank check to implement ultra-liberal policies. Even though John Kasich noted that many Republicans may not have imagined voting for Joe Biden and went on to say, “I don’t believe Joe will turn sharp left,” that message would be better received from other sources than a man who came up short in a primary against the president. Appealing to moderate voters (a group that can include Republicans and former Republicans) is essential for Mr. Biden’s success, but it is part of a difficult balancing act that the Democratic ticket must undertake. Progressives do not want to hear from an anti-abortion, union-busting conservative governor from Ohio. Republicans don’t want to hear from a self-proclaimed socialist who supports Medicare-For-All and the Green New Deal. It is incumbent on the nominee to give both of those groups a reason to see in him the better path forward, but there may be limits to what even Mr. Biden can accomplish on this front. In an already abbreviated party convention, Democrats have precious time to fix some of the divisions that exist within their party, generate enthusiasm in the base, and communicate to independents that they are more than just “Not Donald Trump,” but a party of ideas that they can support. And for Trump-skeptical Republicans and former Republicans, they see a three-way race among a tax-and-spend liberal, a print-and-spend conservative, and the decision to stay home. John Kasich speaking on the DNC stage Monday night may not switch many voters. Instead, Donald Trump is the Republican with the greatest capacity to push Biden-curious Republicans to go to the polls and vote Democratic. RELATED CONTENT Elaine Kamarck, William A.

,,Joe Biden,"   Joe Biden (born November 20, 1942, Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S.) 46th president of the United States (2021– ) and 47th vice president of the United States (2009–17) in the Democratic administration of Pres. Barack Obama. He previously represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate (1973–2009). In April 2023 Joe Biden formally announced his bid for reelection as president in 2024. Biden, who was raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and New Castle county, Delaware, received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Delaware in 1965 and a law degree from Syracuse University in New York in 1968. During this time he married (1966) Neilia Hunter, and the couple later had three children. After graduating from law school, Biden returned to Delaware to work as an attorney before quickly turning to politics, serving on the New Castle county council from 1970 to 1972. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 at the age of 29, becoming the fifth youngest senator in history. About a month later his wife and infant daughter were killed in a car accident, and his two sons were seriously injured. Although he contemplated suspending his political career, Biden was persuaded to join the Senate in 1973, and he went on to win reelection six times, becoming Delaware’s longest-serving senator. In 1977 he married Jill Jacobs, an educator, and they later had a daughter. In addition to his role as U.S. senator, Biden also was an adjunct professor (1991–2008) at the Wilmington, Delaware, branch of the Widener University School of Law. As a senator, Biden focused on foreign relations, criminal justice, and drug policy. He served on the Senate’s Foreign Relations Committee, twice as its chair (2001–03; 2007–09), and on the Committee on the Judiciary, serving as its chair from 1987 to 1995. He was particularly outspoken on issues related to the Kosovo conflict of the late ’90s, urging U.S. action against Serbian forces to protect Kosovars against an offensive by Serbian Pres. Slobodan Milošević. On the Iraq War (2003–11), Biden proposed a partition plan as a way to maintain a united, peaceful Iraq. Biden also was a member of the International Narcotics Control Caucus and was the lead senator in writing the law that established the office of “drug czar,” a position that oversees the national drug-control policy. Biden pursued the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew after it was revealed that parts of his campaign stump speech had been plagiarized from British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock without appropriate attribution. His 2008 presidential campaign never gained momentum, and he withdrew from the race after placing fifth in the Iowa Democratic caucus in January of that year. (For coverage of the 2008 election, see United States Presidential Election of 2008.) After Barack Obama amassed enough delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, Biden emerged as a front-runner to be Obama’s vice presidential running mate. On August 23 Obama officially announced his selection of Biden as the Democratic Party’s vice presidential nominee, and on August 27 Obama and Biden secured the Democratic Party’s nomination. On November 4 the Obama-Biden ticket defeated John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, and Biden also easily won reelection to his U.S. Senate seat. He resigned from the Senate post shortly before taking the oath of office as vice president on January 20, 2009. In November 2012 Obama and Biden were reelected for a second term, defeating the Republican ticket of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. As vice president, Biden played an active role in the administration, serving as an influential adviser to Obama and a vocal supporter of his initiatives. In addition, he was tasked with notable assignments. He helped avert several budget crises and played a key role in shaping U.S. policy in Iraq. In 2015 his eldest son, Beau, died from brain cancer; Biden recounted the experience in Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose (2017). Several months later, Biden—who enjoyed high favourability ratings, partly due to a candour and affable manner that resonated with the public—announced that he would not enter the 2016 presidential election, noting that the family was still grieving. Instead, he campaigned for Hillary Clinton, who ultimately lost the election to Donald Trump. Biden’s close relationship with Obama was evident when the latter surprised him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with distinction, on January 12, 2017, just days before they left office. When Obama presented the rarely given honour, he referred to Biden as “my brother.” Later that year Biden and his wife established the Biden Foundation, a charitable group involved in various causes. Biden remained involved in politics and was a vocal critic of Pres. Donald Trump. Biden himself faced censure when, in 2019, various women accused him of inappropriate physical contact, notably hugging and kissing. Although his response was widely derided—“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more.…I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman”—his popularity remained high. Amid growing speculation that he would run for president in 2020, Biden announced his candidacy in April 2019, joining a crowded Democratic field. Biden immediately became a front-runner, and he pursued a platform that was considered moderate, especially as compared with such candidates as Bernie Sanders. A poor performance in the party’s first debate in June 2019, however, raised questions about Biden, and his support dipped. After the first three nomination contests in early 2020, Sanders seemed poised to become the party’s nominee. However, worries about Sanders’s electability in the general election galvanized moderate voters, and in South Carolina in late February Biden won a resounding victory. Numerous candidates subsequently dropped out, and by early March it had become a two-man race between Biden and Sanders. As Biden registered more wins, he soon took a commanding lead in delegates. After the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States stalled the campaigns, Sanders dropped out in April, and Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee. In the ensuing months Biden outlined a platform that included a number of policies that appealed to progressives. He notably supported government aid to low-income communities, ambitious climate change legislation, affordable child care, and the expansion of federal health insurance plans, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which had been enacted during Obama’s presidency. During this time Biden gained a somewhat sizable lead over Trump in nationwide polls, in part due to criticism of the president’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused an economic downturn that rivaled the Great Depression. In August 2020 Biden chose Kamala Harris as his running mate—she became the first African American woman to appear on a major party’s national ticket—and later that month, he officially was named the Democratic presidential nominee. Although preelection polling had shown Biden with a significant lead in key battleground states, the actual contest proved to be much closer. Nevertheless, Biden and Harris succeeded in rebuilding the so-called “Blue Wall” through the Midwestern Rust Belt states, and on November 7, four days after the election, Biden secured the 270 electoral votes necessary to capture the presidency. Biden’s eventual electoral vote total was 306 to Trump’s 232; Biden won the popular vote by more than seven million votes. Trump and several other Republican leaders subsequently challenged the election results, claiming voter fraud. Although a number of lawsuits were filed, no evidence was provided to support the allegations, and the vast majority of the cases were dismissed. During this time, Biden and Harris began the transition to a new administration, announcing an agenda and selecting staff. By early December all states had certified the election results, and the process then moved to Congress for final certification. Amid Trump’s repeated calls for Republicans to overturn the election, a group of Republican congressional members, notably including Senators Josh Hawley (Missouri) and Ted Cruz (Texas), announced that they would challenge the electors of various states. As the proceedings began on January 6, 2021, a large crowd of Trump supporters marched to the U.S. Capitol from a rally near the White House, where Trump had delivered an incendiary speech repeating false allegations of voter fraud by Democrats and urging his supporters to “fight like hell.” Overwhelming Capitol police, the rioters stormed the complex and vandalized and looted the interior, resulting in the deaths of five people, including one Capitol police officer (see United States Capitol attack of 2021). After several hours the building was finally secured, and Biden and Harris were certified as the winners. Two weeks later, amid a massive security presence, Biden was sworn in as president. The 2020 election was marked by a historically large voter turnout, made possible in part by modifications in voting procedures initiated in many states to ensure that voters could cast their ballots safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly more Democrats voted in the 2020 election than in previous presidential contests, and the Democratic Party not only won the presidential election but also maintained its control of the U.S. House of Representatives and took control of the U.S. Senate from Republicans, though only by the slimmest of margins (the resulting Senate membership was evenly divided between the two parties at 50 senators each, but tie votes could be broken by Vice President Harris, acting in her constitutional role as president of the Senate). In the view of many Democrats, particularly progressives, the party’s simultaneous control of the presidency and both houses of Congress afforded it a rare opportunity to pass transformative legislation that promised to make American society more democratic, equitable, and just. During the first weeks of his presidency, Biden signed a raft of executive orders, actions, and memoranda, many of which rescinded policies of the Trump administration, particularly in the areas of immigration, health care, and the environment. Notably, on his first day in office, Biden issued executive orders that reentered the United States into the Paris Agreement on climate change and canceled the country’s withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March 2021 the Biden administration used budget reconciliation (a process that prevents certain budget-related bills in the Senate from being filibustered) to secure passage by Congress, without Republican support, of a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill, the American Rescue Plan. The law included, among other measures, one-time payments for lower- and middle-income Americans; extended unemployment benefits; an expanded child tax credit; financial aid to state and local governments, schools, and childcare providers; housing assistance; and additional funding for coronavirus testing, contact tracing, and vaccine distribution. Biden supported three significant pieces of voting rights and electoral-reform legislation: the For the People Act, passed by the House in March 2021; the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, passed by the House in August; and the Freedom to Vote Act, introduced in the Senate in September. (The first two bills were later versions of legislation passed by the House in 2019.) All three bills were blocked in the Senate by Republican filibusters, which could be overcome only with the support of at least 60 senators. The bills were designed to prevent states from adopting egregious voter suppression laws, to eliminate partisan and racial gerrymandering, and to make elections more transparent by requiring “dark money” organizations to disclose their donors (see campaign finance; campaign finance laws). The failure of the electoral-reform measures, which Democrats viewed as essential to preserving American democracy, prompted progressive and even some moderate Democrats to urge the elimination of the filibuster, which is not established in the U.S. Constitution and can be ended by the Senate in a simple majority vote. In August the Senate passed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a drastically scaled-back ($550 billion) version of a wide-ranging infrastructure plan announced by Biden in March, its smaller scale made necessary by objections from Republicans and conservative Democrats to spending levels, tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, and several social spending provisions. The bill then languished in the House for months as progressive, moderate, and conservative Democrats debated its provisions, progressives refusing to support it except in combination with a larger social spending bill and conservatives insisting that it be voted on separately. In early November, following important off-year elections in which Democrats suffered several unexpected defeats—signaling a likely loss of the House and Senate to Republicans in the 2022 election—Biden and Democratic House leaders intensified their efforts to reconcile the factions, arguing that some tangible legislative achievement was necessary to retain the support of swing voters. After progressives finally conceded, the infrastructure bill was passed and sent to Biden for his signature. On December 13, 2022, Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act. The act formally repealed the federal Defense of Marriage Act (1996), which had defined marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman and had permitted states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Biden had also appointed as U.S. secretary of transportation (2021– ) Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay cabinet member in American history who had unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Among Biden’s goals in foreign policy were to repair frayed relations with several U.S. allies, to cooperate in global efforts to ameliorate climate change, and, in general, to return the United States to a position of global economic and political leadership. Biden had also promised during his campaign that he would withdraw all remaining U.S. troops from Afghanistan, finally ending nearly 20 years of U.S. military involvement in the country during all phases of the Afghanistan War, the longest military conflict ever fought by the United States. In April 2021 Biden announced a withdrawal of all U.S. troops by September 11—an extension of the May 1 withdrawal deadline negotiated with the Taliban by the Trump administration in 2020. By early August, after Biden had advanced the withdrawal deadline to August 31, the Taliban had begun to take military control of several Afghan provinces, and soon thereafter the Afghan capital, Kabul, was captured and the national government collapsed. Chaos ensued as the airport in Kabul was flooded with desperate Afghan refugees seeking to flee the country on American evacuation flights. During and after the withdrawal, the Biden administration was criticized by Republican and some Democratic leaders for having misjudged the strength and resolve of both the Taliban and the Afghan government and security forces.      Kamala Harris (born October 20, 1964, Oakland, California, U.S.) 49th vice president of the United States (2021– ) in the Democratic administration of Pres. Joe Biden. She was the first woman and the first African American to hold the post. She had previously served in the U.S. Senate (2017–21) and as attorney general of California (2011–17). Her father, who was Jamaican, taught at Stanford University, and her mother, the daughter of an Indian diplomat, was a cancer researcher. Her younger sister, Maya, later became a public policy advocate. After studying political science and economics (B.A., 1986) at Howard University, Kamala earned a law degree (1989) from Hastings College. She subsequently worked as a deputy district attorney (1990–98) in Oakland, earning a reputation for toughness as she prosecuted cases of gang violence, drug trafficking, and sexual abuse. Harris rose through the ranks, becoming district attorney in 2004. In 2010 she was narrowly elected attorney general of California—winning by a margin of less than 1 percent—thus becoming the first female and the first African American to hold the post. After taking office the following year, she demonstrated political independence, rejecting, for example, pressure from the administration of Pres. Barack Obama for her to settle a nationwide lawsuit against mortgage lenders for unfair practices. Instead, she pressed California’s case and in 2012 won a judgment five times higher than that originally offered. Her refusal to defend Proposition 8 (2008), which banned same-sex marriage in the state, helped lead to it being overturned in 2013. Harris’s book, Smart on Crime (2009; cowritten with Joan O’C. Hamilton), was considered a model for dealing with the problem of criminal recidivism. In 2012 Harris delivered a memorable address at the Democratic National Convention, raising her national profile. Two years later she married attorney Douglas Emhoff. Widely considered a rising star within the party, she was recruited to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Barbara Boxer, who was retiring. In early 2015 Harris declared her candidacy, and on the campaign trail she called for immigration and criminal-justice reforms, increases to the minimum wage, and protection of women’s reproductive rights. She easily won the 2016 election. When she took office in January 2017, Harris became the first Indian American in the Senate and just the second Black woman. She began serving on both the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Judiciary Committee, among other assignments. She became known for her prosecutorial style of questioning witnesses during hearings, which drew criticism—and occasional interruptions—from Republican senators. In June she drew particular attention for her questions to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was testifying before the intelligence committee on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election; she had earlier called on him to resign. Harris’s memoir, The Truths We Hold: An American Journey, was published in January 2019. Shortly thereafter Harris announced that she was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. From the outset she was seen as one of the leading contenders, and she drew particular attention when, during a primary debate, she had a contentious exchange with fellow candidate Joe Biden over his opposition to school busing in the 1970s and ’80s, among other race-related topics. Although Harris’s support initially increased, by September 2019 her campaign was in serious trouble, and in December she dropped out of the race. She continued to maintain a high profile, notably becoming a leading advocate for social-justice reform following the May 2020 death of George Floyd, an African American who had been in police custody. Her efforts silenced some who had criticized her tenure as attorney general, alleging that she had failed to investigate charges of police misconduct, including questionable shootings. Others, however, felt that her embrace of reform was a political maneuver to capitalize on the increasing public popularity of social change. As racial injustice became a major issue in the United States, many Democrats called on Biden, the party’s presumptive nominee, to select an African American woman—a demographic that was seen as pivotal to his election chances—as his vice presidential running mate. In August Biden chose Harris, and she thus was the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s national ticket. In November she became the first Black woman to be elected vice president of the United States. In the ensuing weeks Trump and various other Republicans challenged the election results, claiming voter fraud. Although a number of lawsuits were filed, no evidence was provided to support the allegations, and the vast majority of the cases were dismissed. During this time Harris and Biden began the transition to a new administration, announcing an agenda and selecting staff. By early December all states had certified the election results, and the process then moved to Congress for final certification. Amid Trump’s repeated calls for Republicans to overturn the election, a group of congressional members, which notably included Senators Josh Hawley (Missouri) and Ted Cruz (Texas), announced that they would challenge the electors of various states. Shortly after the proceedings began on January 6, 2021, a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol. It took several hours to secure the building, but Biden and Harris were eventually certified as the winners. She later denounced the siege—which many believed was incited by Trump—as “an assault on America’s democracy.” On January 18 she officially resigned from the Senate. Two days later, amid an incredible security presence, Harris was sworn in as vice president.          ",www.britannica.com,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden,
,,Three Comforting Lies Democrats Need to Stop Telling Themselves About November,"President Joe Biden is in trouble in this November’s election. This does not mean he is guaranteed to lose, but defeat by a vengeful, unhinged Donald Trump and his radicalized Republican Party is a much more realistic possibility than many Democrats seem willing to accept. And if they are to rise out of the torpor of this dreadful situation, Democrats have to first stop telling each other comforting lies about what’s actually happening out there. I understand why it is so hard to believe—Trump is an absurd, repellent human being who not only is promising to install a soft dictatorship in the United States as his first order of business but continues to accept zero accountability for the attempted putsch his team of Keystone Coupsters ran after the 2020 presidential election. He is threatening a military invasion of blue states and cities, egging on Texas neo-confederates on the verge of a shooting war with federal troops over the border, promising to lay off virtually the entire federal workforce and replace them with Turning Point USA interns, and facing 91 felony counts in four separate cases. He was recently found liable by a jury for sexual assault and then ordered to pay his victim more than $83 million. When speaking, he usually makes about as much sense as a refrigerator-magnet set assembled into sentences by a 2-year-old. But the fact that so many find the possibility of a Trump restoration to be utterly inexplicable, or even farcical, does not mean that it could not happen. And right now, there are too many high-profile voices in Democratic circles spinning yarns about how happy days will be here again soon and that Biden is in a fantastic position, actually. They are well-meaning (to use a phrase that got bandied about a lot last week by newly minted memory and aging specialist Robert Hur), but a lot of Democrats are telling each other these three comforting lies that aren’t ultimately going to help anyone. Late last month, New York Times columnist and podcaster Ezra Klein hosted veteran Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg to make the case for why Democrats should not be flipping out about the polls. Rosenberg’s very vocal and public position that 2022 wasn’t going to be a red-wave election has earned him near-mythical status in certain Democratic circles of the kind that was once enjoyed by former FiveThirtyEight data guru Nate Silver. “Democrats keep overperforming in elections,” Rosenberg said. He noted that Democrats did much better than expected in the midterms, as well as in the small number of significant races in 2023. He added that “when we actually go vote, we just keep winning, and they keep losing. And so I go into 2024 feeling really good about where we are.” And he was right about a few things. Particularly in some high-profile 2022 Senate and gubernatorial races, a handful of partisan-aligned pollsters were bending the averages on sites like RealClearPolitics and adding to an atmosphere of unnecessary panic among Democrats. Take, for example, the race for governor in Arizona, where RCP had Republican election denier Kari Lake with a 3.5-point lead that was produced almost entirely by election-week polls from Republican firms Remington Research and Trafalgar. Lake lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs by under 1 point. That’s not actually a particularly huge miss, but it wasn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Rosenberg also insisted that Democrats had a real chance to hold the House of Representatives, which at the time was considered close to laughable in national circles. Democrats did end up losing the House, but they got the enduring narrative win. And on election night, as his prophecies came true one after another, he got upgraded from “I don’t know this guy but I hope against hope that he’s right” to Nostradamus. The problem for using the red wave that wasn’t as a template for 2024 is that Democrats outperformed narratives and expectations more than polls in 2022. There was very little in the available polling on election night 2022 that suggested Republicans were on the verge of a 2010-style midterm romp. In fact, the final generic ballot polling average on the much-maligned RealClearPolitics was that Republicans would win the national House vote by 2.5 points. They ended up winning it by 2.8. Polling as an industry and an art has taken a bludgeoning since 2016. And it is true that some individual state polling was improbably off in 2016 and 2020, largely but not exclusively in the Midwest. But everyone seems to have forgotten that the national polls in 2016 were close to as good as they’ve ever been, with Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 2.1 percent against a final RealClearPolitics average lead of 3.2 percent. Nationally, Trump beat expectations produced by forecaster certainty as much as he outperformed his actual polls. And in 2020, Trump ran ahead of his national polling average by a mere 3 points and once again came agonizingly close to victory in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Arizona. What is true is that the Dobbs backlash seems to have set the Republican electoral ceiling somewhat lower for the time being. In both 2022 and 2023 they lost races that should have been winnable for the opposition party with an unpopular president and an improving but still uneven economy. Republicans have also been getting dusted in special elections everywhere since Dobbs, including on Tuesday in the race to fill the expelled Republican George Santos’ House seat. But this underperformance appears to be already baked into head-to-head presidential polling, and the Republican electorate’s insistence on once again forwarding Donald Trump as their nominee is exacerbating the effect. That’s clear from the fairly substantial body of survey research that currently shows Trump edging out the president narrowly but Nikki Haley beating Biden decisively. But it is also the case that it might be Democrats who are now underperforming their expectations, if you believe the polling (which you should). With an incumbent president, very low unemployment and strong GDP growth, Biden ought to be on a glide path to reelection, especially with the incandescent fury about Dobbs powering Democrats elsewhere. But he’s not. And that brings us to the polls themselves, which the optimists are also telling you to ignore. The idea that polls are basically meaningless 10 months from a presidential election in which both candidates have close to 100 percent name recognition is one of those pieces of conventional wisdom that is as untraceable as a gun that has had its serial number scrubbed off. It was something that even Klein repeated in his interview with Rosenberg. On Wednesday, MSNBC columnist Michael A. Cohen called polling nine months from a presidential election “largely useless.” I genuinely have no idea why people keep saying this. In 2020, Biden led Trump by 5.6 points on Feb. 16, and bested him in November by 4.5. In 2016, Hillary Clinton led Donald Trump by 3.4 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average, in a race she ultimately won nationally by 2.1 percent. On this day in 2012, Barack Obama led Republican Mitt Romney by 5.7 points and put him away in November by 3.9 percent. The most comforting comparison for Democrats might be 2004, when John Kerry was ahead of incumbent Republican President George W. Bush by 1.9 points in an average of the last 10 polls through Feb. 16, and Bush came back to win by 2.4 percent. But that’s still only about a 4-point swing overall. The best you can say about this data, from a Biden Booster perspective, is that it always bounces around by a few points. But Biden, at the moment, likely needs more than a few points of recovery to win an Electoral College that still appears tilted against Democrats. And while there are plausible theories about why Biden’s polling might get better soon, and while it wouldn’t be especially surprising if it happened, there’s no particular reason to expect it to happen. On the contrary, all of the data that we have available to us suggests that the outcome of this November’s election will be within a few agonizing points of today’s averages: a 3-point Trump advantage in the Economist’s model, and a 1.1-point Trump lead in the RealClearPolitics average. The odds of this matchup being anything other than Biden–Trump, for better or worse, are pretty long at this point. These men are completely known quantities engaged in the first presidential rematch since 1956. Even someone who has been in a coma since late 2019 would have pretty firm opinions about them. But the Democratic optimists would have you believe that an electorally significant chunk of voters will soon change their minds. Why might Trump’s lead be a chimera? According to one prominent theory, it’s because the inevitability of Trump’s nomination hasn’t broken through to voters who are unhappy with Joe Biden but who will ultimately come home. As the Editorial Board’s John Stoehr noted in a widely shared thread Tuesday on X, “Most people still don’t quite believe Trump is going to be the Republican Party’s nominee.” Once they do, he says, “a switch will turn on.” This theory supposes that the polling disadvantage will vanish like George Santos from the House floor or the critical race theory panic from the local school board meeting. I’ll admit to thinking some version of this might be at work; voters simply aren’t taking another Trump term seriously enough, and once they do, surely they will come to their senses and start telling pollsters that they will back Biden. The trouble with this theory is that it should already be working its magic, and there is no evidence that it is. We’re halfway through February, not mired in some slow-news-cycle August afternoon the year before the election. The more time passes with Trump leading in polling averages, the less likely it is that there is anything particularly mysterious at work here at all. Trump is utterly dominating the Republican nominating contests thus far and is leading his only remaining challenger, Nikki Haley, by more than 30 points in her home state of South Carolina. His campaign, his voluminous legal troubles, and his own personal, ceaseless antics have been fixtures in the news for months. Even if you argue that there are warning signs in the outcomes for him, there can’t be much remaining doubt that he will claim the GOP nomination. And that means that all the special election overperformances, 2022 exuberance, multiple consecutive cycles of poor performance from the MAGA-fied GOP, and righteous post-Dobbs anger have to, at some point, add up to a polling lead for Joe Biden. Unless and until that happens, arguing that Biden is a lock to win in spite of the evidence in front of you is to substitute disbelief for empirical reality. As Rosenberg put it incredulously, “The theory is that all this—the fact that Democrats just keep winning everywhere in red states and blue states, and ballot initiatives, and off-year elections, and special elections—isn’t going to translate over into 2024.” But that is exactly what the data is telling us! This denial is the same incredulity that led many to dismiss the possibility of Trump becoming the Republican nominee in 2016 despite his consistent polling leads throughout the cycle. The party decides, they said. No one so despised by their party establishment had ever captured a major party nomination—until one did. It is the same incredulity that led many voters to stay home or vote for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson in 2016. It has now been almost nine years since the guy descended the escalator at Trump Tower, yapping incoherently about Mexican rapists and how we “should’ve taken” Iraq’s oil and free-associating about the hotels ISIS was building in Syria.* Nothing about him has changed since that day, or will ever change. And if Democrats are to hand him one last defeat and avoid the almost unfathomable catastrophe of a second Trump term, they are going to have to start acting like they understand just how close they are to disaster.

,,,"    The president’s full-throated support of Israel’s war in Gaza continues to hurt him with young voters and voters of color—and the threat that Trump would be worse isn’t resonating. The 2024 presidential election is less than a year away, and polls continue to show President Joe Biden tied with or losing to future federal felon Donald Trump. While I don’t put much stock in polls taken a year before the election (at this point in 2011, Barack Obama would have lost the 2012 race to a plumber), Biden’s falling approval numbers with young voters and voters of color is frightening. In particular, Biden’s full-throated support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the low value he and his administration seem to place on the lives of Palestinians, appear to be hurting him with Arab American voters and young voters of all backgrounds. Plenty of Americans think Biden is doing the right thing in the Middle East. If you are one of those people, you should vote for Biden next November. Even the conservative Fox News commentator Brit Hume praised Biden’s leadership during this international crisis, so hopefully Biden can count on his vote. Best of luck with that. But there are other Americans—people no less important to Biden’s coalition, and more reliable as Democratic voters than Fox pundits—who view his foreign policy as aiding and abetting war crimes against the Palestinian people. Some Arab Americans have declared they simply will not vote for Biden (a recent poll found that just 17 percent of Arab Americans plan to vote for the president next year, sharply down from the 59 percent who supported him in 2020), and social media is awash with young people saying they will not vote for him either. The response to these voters from other, more establishment Democrats—particularly to the Arab American voters, both on social media and in most cable news coverage—has been vicious. Biden supporters on social media seem to relish pointing out that Trump would “have you deported,” adding that they’ll deserve what they get if Trump wins. Older voters call the young ones petulant and ill-informed if they try to hold Biden accountable for the role America plays in the civilian deaths in Gaza. And always, there is the suggestion that these voters are antisemitic, as if opposing the slaughter of Jews and opposing the slaughter of Palestinians are mutually exclusive positions.

,,The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,"A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing. The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence.    Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged cities across the U.S. to celebrate the democratic process that resulted in Trump’s ouster. A second odd thing happened amid Trump’s attempts to reverse the result: corporate America turned on him. Hundreds of major business leaders, many of whom had backed Trump’s candidacy and supported his policies, called on him to concede. To the President, something felt amiss. “It was all very, very strange,” Trump said on Dec. 2. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even while many key states were still being counted.” In a way, Trump was right. There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes, one that both curtailed the protests and coordinated the resistance from CEOs. Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans. The pact was formalized in a terse, little-noticed joint statement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day. Both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain–inspired by the summer’s massive, sometimes destructive racial-justice protests–in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump’s assault on democracy. The handshake between business and labor was just one component of a vast, cross-partisan campaign to protect the election–an extraordinary shadow effort dedicated not to winning the vote but to ensuring it would be free and fair, credible and uncorrupted. For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America’s institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from a remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined President. Though much of this activity took place on the left, it was separate from the Biden campaign and crossed ideological lines, with crucial contributions by nonpartisan and conservative actors. The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory. It was an election so calamitous that no result could be discerned at all, a failure of the central act of democratic self-governance that has been a hallmark of America since its founding. Their work touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program. For Trump and his allies were running their own campaign to spoil the election. The President spent months insisting that mail ballots were a Democratic plot and the election would be “rigged.” His henchmen at the state level sought to block their use, while his lawyers brought dozens of spurious suits to make it more difficult to vote–an intensification of the GOP’s legacy of suppressive tactics. Before the election, Trump plotted to block a legitimate vote count. And he spent the months following Nov. 3 trying to steal the election he’d lost–with lawsuits and conspiracy theories, pressure on state and local officials, and finally summoning his army of supporters to the Jan. 6 rally that ended in deadly violence at the Capitol. The democracy campaigners watched with alarm. “Every week, we felt like we were in a struggle to try to pull off this election without the country going through a real dangerous moment of unraveling,” says former GOP Representative Zach Wamp, a Trump supporter who helped coordinate a bipartisan election-protection council. “We can look back and say this thing went pretty well, but it was not at all clear in September and October that that was going to be the case.” This is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election, based on access to the group’s inner workings, never-before-seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved from across the political spectrum. It is the story of an unprecedented, creative and determined campaign whose success also reveals how close the nation came to disaster. “Every attempt to interfere with the proper outcome of the election was defeated,” says Ian Bassin, co-founder of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan rule-of-law advocacy group. “But it’s massively important for the country to understand that it didn’t happen accidentally. The system didn’t work magically. Democracy is not self-executing.” That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures. Sometime in the fall of 2019, Mike Podhorzer became convinced the election was headed for disaster–and determined to protect it. This was not his usual purview. For nearly a quarter-century, Podhorzer, senior adviser to the president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest union federation, has marshaled the latest tactics and data to help its favored candidates win elections. Unassuming and professorial, he isn’t the sort of hair-gelled “political strategist” who shows up on cable news. Among Democratic insiders, he’s known as the wizard behind some of the biggest advances in political technology in recent decades. A group of liberal strategists he brought together in the early 2000s led to the creation of the Analyst Institute, a secretive firm that applies scientific methods to political campaigns. He was also involved in the founding of Catalist, the flagship progressive data company. The endless chatter in Washington about “political strategy,” Podhorzer believes, has little to do with how change really gets made. “My basic take on politics is that it’s all pretty obvious if you don’t overthink it or swallow the prevailing frameworks whole,” he once wrote. “After that, just relentlessly identify your assumptions and challenge them.” Podhorzer applies that approach to everything: when he coached his now adult son’s Little League team in the D.C. suburbs, he trained the boys not to swing at most pitches–a tactic that infuriated both their and their opponents’ parents, but won the team a series of championships. Trump’s election in 2016–credited in part to his unusual strength among the sort of blue collar white voters who once dominated the AFL-CIO–prompted Podhorzer to question his assumptions about voter behavior. He began circulating weekly number-crunching memos to a small circle of allies and hosting strategy sessions in D.C. But when he began to worry about the election itself, he didn’t want to seem paranoid. It was only after months of research that he introduced his concerns in his newsletter in October 2019. The usual tools of data, analytics and polling would not be sufficient in a situation where the President himself was trying to disrupt the election, he wrote. “Most of our planning takes us through Election Day,” he noted. “But, we are not prepared for the two most likely outcomes”–Trump losing and refusing to concede, and Trump winning the Electoral College (despite losing the popular vote) by corrupting the voting process in key states. “We desperately need to systematically ‘red-team’ this election so that we can anticipate and plan for the worst we know will be coming our way.” It turned out Podhorzer wasn’t the only one thinking in these terms. He began to hear from others eager to join forces. The Fight Back Table, a coalition of “resistance” organizations, had begun scenario-planning around the potential for a contested election, gathering liberal activists at the local and national level into what they called the Democracy Defense Coalition. Voting-rights and civil rights organizations were raising alarms. A group of former elected officials was researching emergency powers they feared Trump might exploit. Protect Democracy was assembling a bipartisan election-crisis task force. “It turned out that once you said it out loud, people agreed,” Podhorzer says, “and it started building momentum.” He spent months pondering scenarios and talking to experts. It wasn’t hard to find liberals who saw Trump as a dangerous dictator, but Podhorzer was careful to steer clear of hysteria. What he wanted to know was not how American democracy was dying but how it might be kept alive. The chief difference between the U.S. and countries that lost their grip on democracy, he concluded, was that America’s decentralized election system couldn’t be rigged in one fell swoop. That presented an opportunity to shore it up. On March 3, Podhorzer drafted a three-page confidential memo titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” “Trump has made it clear that this will not be a fair election, and that he will reject anything but his own re-election as ‘fake’ and rigged,” he wrote. “On Nov. 3, should the media report otherwise, he will use the right-wing information system to establish his narrative and incite his supporters to protest.” The memo laid out four categories of challenges: attacks on voters, attacks on election administration, attacks on Trump’s political opponents and “efforts to reverse the results of the election.” Then COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary-election season. Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff polling places. But political disagreements, intensified by Trump’s crusade against mail voting, prevented some states from making it easier to vote absentee and for jurisdictions to count those votes in a timely manner. Chaos ensued. Ohio shut down in-person voting for its primary, leading to minuscule turnout. A poll-worker shortage in Milwaukee–where Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic Black population is concentrated–left just five open polling places, down from 182. In New York, vote counting took more than a month. Suddenly, the potential for a November meltdown was obvious. In his apartment in the D.C. suburbs, Podhorzer began working from his laptop at his kitchen table, holding back-to-back Zoom meetings for hours a day with his network of contacts across the progressive universe: the labor movement; the institutional left, like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace; resistance groups like Indivisible and MoveOn; progressive data geeks and strategists, representatives of donors and foundations, state-level grassroots organizers, racial-justice activists and others. In April, Podhorzer began hosting a weekly 2½-hour Zoom. It was structured around a series of rapid-fire five-minute presentations on everything from which ads were working to messaging to legal strategy. The invitation-only gatherings soon attracted hundreds, creating a rare shared base of knowledge for the fractious progressive movement. “At the risk of talking trash about the left, there’s not a lot of good information sharing,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a close Podhorzer friend whose poll-tested messaging guidance shaped the group’s approach. “There’s a lot of not-invented-here syndrome, where people won’t consider a good idea if they didn’t come up with it.” The meetings became the galactic center for a constellation of operatives across the left who shared overlapping goals but didn’t usually work in concert. The group had no name, no leaders and no hierarchy, but it kept the disparate actors in sync. “Pod played a critical behind-the-scenes role in keeping different pieces of the movement infrastructure in communication and aligned,” says Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “You have the litigation space, the organizing space, the political people just focused on the W, and their strategies aren’t always aligned. He allowed this ecosystem to work together.” Protecting the election would require an effort of unprecedented scale. As 2020 progressed, it stretched to Congress, Silicon Valley and the nation’s statehouses. It drew energy from the summer’s racial-justice protests, many of whose leaders were a key part of the liberal alliance. And eventually it reached across the aisle, into the world of Trump-skeptical Republicans appalled by his attacks on democracy. The first task was overhauling America’s balky election infrastructure–in the middle of a pandemic. For the thousands of local, mostly nonpartisan officials who administer elections, the most urgent need was money. They needed protective equipment like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. They needed to pay for postcards letting people know they could vote absentee–or, in some states, to mail ballots to every voter. They needed additional staff and scanners to process ballots. In March, activists appealed to Congress to steer COVID relief money to election administration. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 150 organizations signed a letter to every member of Congress seeking $2 billion in election funding. It was somewhat successful: the CARES Act, passed later that month, contained $400 million in grants to state election administrators. But the next tranche of relief funding didn’t add to that number. It wasn’t going to be enough. Private philanthropy stepped into the breach. An assortment of foundations contributed tens of millions in election-administration funding. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative chipped in $300 million. “It was a failure at the federal level that 2,500 local election officials were forced to apply for philanthropic grants to fill their needs,” says Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election official who heads the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute. McReynolds’ two-year-old organization became a clearinghouse for a nation struggling to adapt. The institute gave secretaries of state from both parties technical advice on everything from which vendors to use to how to locate drop boxes. Local officials are the most trusted sources of election information, but few can afford a press secretary, so the institute distributed communications tool kits. In a presentation to Podhorzer’s group, McReynolds detailed the importance of absentee ballots for shortening lines at polling places and preventing an election crisis. The institute’s work helped 37 states and D.C. bolster mail voting. But it wouldn’t be worth much if people didn’t take advantage. Part of the challenge was logistical: each state has different rules for when and how ballots should be requested and returned. The Voter Participation Center, which in a normal year would have supported local groups deploying canvassers door-to-door to get out the vote, instead conducted focus groups in April and May to find out what would get people to vote by mail. In August and September, it sent ballot applications to 15 million people in key states, 4.6 million of whom returned them. In mailings and digital ads, the group urged people not to wait for Election Day. “All the work we have done for 17 years was built for this moment of bringing democracy to people’s doorsteps,” says Tom Lopach, the center’s CEO. The effort had to overcome heightened skepticism in some communities. Many Black voters preferred to exercise their franchise in person or didn’t trust the mail. National civil rights groups worked with local organizations to get the word out that this was the best way to ensure one’s vote was counted. In Philadelphia, for example, advocates distributed “voting safety kits” containing masks, hand sanitizer and informational brochures. “We had to get the message out that this is safe, reliable, and you can trust it,” says Hannah Fried of All Voting Is Local. At the same time, Democratic lawyers battled a historic tide of pre-election litigation. The pandemic intensified the parties’ usual tangling in the courts. But the lawyers noticed something else as well. “The litigation brought by the Trump campaign, of a piece with the broader campaign to sow doubt about mail voting, was making novel claims and using theories no court has ever accepted,” says Wendy Weiser, a voting-rights expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. “They read more like lawsuits designed to send a message rather than achieve a legal outcome.” In the end, nearly half the electorate cast ballots by mail in 2020, practically a revolution in how people vote. About a quarter voted early in person. Only a quarter of voters cast their ballots the traditional way: in person on Election Day. Bad actors spreading false information is nothing new. For decades, campaigns have grappled with everything from anonymous calls claiming the election has been rescheduled to fliers spreading nasty smears about candidates’ families. But Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, the viral force of social media and the involvement of foreign meddlers made disinformation a broader, deeper threat to the 2020 vote. Laura Quinn, a veteran progressive operative who co-founded Catalist, began studying this problem a few years ago. She piloted a nameless, secret project, which she has never before publicly discussed, that tracked disinformation online and tried to figure out how to combat it. One component was tracking dangerous lies that might otherwise spread unnoticed. Researchers then provided information to campaigners or the media to track down the sources and expose them. The most important takeaway from Quinn’s research, however, was that engaging with toxic content only made it worse. “When you get attacked, the instinct is to push back, call it out, say, ‘This isn’t true,'” Quinn says. “But the more engagement something gets, the more the platforms boost it. The algorithm reads that as, ‘Oh, this is popular; people want more of it.'” The solution, she concluded, was to pressure platforms to enforce their rules, both by removing content or accounts that spread disinformation and by more aggressively policing it in the first place. “The platforms have policies against certain types of malign behavior, but they haven’t been enforcing them,” she says. Quinn’s research gave ammunition to advocates pushing social media platforms to take a harder line. In November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election-related falsehoods that were already spreading unchecked. “It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming, all of that to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who attended the dinner and also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. (Gupta has been nominated for Associate Attorney General by President Biden.) “It was a struggle, but we got to the point where they understood the problem. Was it enough? Probably not. Was it later than we wanted? Yes. But it was really important, given the level of official disinformation, that they had those rules in place and were tagging things and taking them down.” Beyond battling bad information, there was a need to explain a rapidly changing election process. It was crucial for voters to understand that despite what Trump was saying, mail-in votes weren’t susceptible to fraud and that it would be normal if some states weren’t finished counting votes on election night. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic former House leader turned high-powered lobbyist, spearheaded one coalition. “We wanted to get a really bipartisan group of former elected officials, Cabinet secretaries, military leaders and so on, aimed mainly at messaging to the public but also speaking to local officials–the secretaries of state, attorneys general, governors who would be in the eye of the storm–to let them know we wanted to help,” says Gephardt, who worked his contacts in the private sector to put $20 million behind the effort. Wamp, the former GOP Congressman, worked through the nonpartisan reform group Issue One to rally Republicans to the effort. “We thought we should bring some bipartisan element of unity around what constitutes a free and fair election,” Wamp says. The 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans on the National Council on Election Integrity met on Zoom at least once a week. They ran ads in six states, made statements, wrote articles and alerted local officials to potential problems. “We had rabid Trump supporters who agreed to serve on the council based on the idea that this is honest,” Wamp says. This is going to be just as important, he told them, to convince the liberals when Trump wins. “Whichever way it cuts, we’re going to stick together.” The Voting Rights Lab and IntoAction created state-specific memes and graphics, spread by email, text, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, urging that every vote be counted. Together, they were viewed more than 1 billion times. Protect Democracy’s election task force issued reports and held media briefings with high-profile experts across the political spectrum, resulting in widespread coverage of potential election issues and fact-checking of Trump’s false claims. The organization’s tracking polls found the message was being heard: the percentage of the public that didn’t expect to know the winner on election night gradually rose until by late October, it was over 70%. A majority also believed that a prolonged count wasn’t a sign of problems. “We knew exactly what Trump was going to do: he was going to try to use the fact that Democrats voted by mail and Republicans voted in person to make it look like he was ahead, claim victory, say the mail-in votes were fraudulent and try to get them thrown out,” says Protect Democracy’s Bassin. Setting public expectations ahead of time helped undercut those lies. The alliance took a common set of themes from the research Shenker-Osorio presented at Podhorzer’s Zooms. Studies have shown that when people don’t think their vote will count or fear casting it will be a hassle, they’re far less likely to participate. Throughout election season, members of Podhorzer’s group minimized incidents of voter intimidation and tamped down rising liberal hysteria about Trump’s expected refusal to concede. They didn’t want to amplify false claims by engaging them, or put people off voting by suggesting a rigged game. “When you say, ‘These claims of fraud are spurious,’ what people hear is ‘fraud,'” Shenker-Osorio says. “What we saw in our pre-election research was that anything that reaffirmed Trump’s power or cast him as an authoritarian diminished people’s desire to vote.” Podhorzer, meanwhile, was warning everyone he knew that polls were underestimating Trump’s support. The data he shared with media organizations who would be calling the election was “tremendously useful” to understand what was happening as the votes rolled in, according to a member of a major network’s political unit who spoke with Podhorzer before Election Day. Most analysts had recognized there would be a “blue shift” in key battlegrounds– the surge of votes breaking toward Democrats, driven by tallies of mail-in ballots– but they hadn’t comprehended how much better Trump was likely to do on Election Day. “Being able to document how big the absentee wave would be and the variance by state was essential,” the analyst says. The racial-justice uprising sparked by George Floyd’s killing in May was not primarily a political movement. The organizers who helped lead it wanted to harness its momentum for the election without allowing it to be co-opted by politicians. Many of those organizers were part of Podhorzer’s network, from the activists in battleground states who partnered with the Democracy Defense Coalition to organizations with leading roles in the Movement for Black Lives. The best way to ensure people’s voices were heard, they decided, was to protect their ability to vote. “We started thinking about a program that would complement the traditional election-protection area but also didn’t rely on calling the police,” says Nelini Stamp, the Working Families Party’s national organizing director. They created a force of “election defenders” who, unlike traditional poll watchers, were trained in de-escalation techniques. During early voting and on Election Day, they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a “joy to the polls” effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open in their communities. The summer uprising had shown that people power could have a massive impact. Activists began preparing to reprise the demonstrations if Trump tried to steal the election. “Americans plan widespread protests if Trump interferes with election,” Reuters reported in October, one of many such stories. More than 150 liberal groups, from the Women’s March to the Sierra Club to Color of Change, from Democrats.com to the Democratic Socialists of America, joined the “Protect the Results” coalition. The group’s now defunct website had a map listing 400 planned postelection demonstrations, to be activated via text message as soon as Nov. 4. To stop the coup they feared, the left was ready to flood the streets. About a week before Election Day, Podhorzer received an unexpected message: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber have a long history of antagonism. Though neither organization is explicitly partisan, the influential business lobby has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Republican campaigns, just as the nation’s unions funnel hundreds of millions to Democrats. On one side is labor, on the other management, locked in an eternal struggle for power and resources. But behind the scenes, the business community was engaged in its own anxious discussions about how the election and its aftermath might unfold. The summer’s racial-justice protests had sent a signal to business owners too: the potential for economy-disrupting civil disorder. “With tensions running high, there was a lot of concern about unrest around the election, or a breakdown in our normal way we handle contentious elections,” says Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer. These worries had led the Chamber to release a pre-election statement with the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based CEOs’ group, as well as associations of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, calling for patience and confidence as votes were counted. But Bradley wanted to send a broader, more bipartisan message. He reached out to Podhorzer, through an intermediary both men declined to name. Agreeing that their unlikely alliance would be powerful, they began to discuss a joint statement pledging their organizations’ shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election. They chose their words carefully and scheduled the statement’s release for maximum impact. As it was being finalized, Christian leaders signaled their interest in joining, further broadening its reach. The statement was released on Election Day, under the names of Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, and the heads of the National Association of Evangelicals and the National African American Clergy Network. “It is imperative that election officials be given the space and time to count every vote in accordance with applicable laws,” it stated. “We call on the media, the candidates and the American people to exercise patience with the process and trust in our system, even if it requires more time than usual.” The groups added, “Although we may not always agree on desired outcomes up and down the ballot, we are united in our call for the American democratic process to proceed without violence, intimidation or any other tactic that makes us weaker as a nation.” Election night began with many Democrats despairing. Trump was running ahead of pre-election polling, winning Florida, Ohio and Texas easily and keeping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania too close to call. But Podhorzer was unperturbed when I spoke to him that night: the returns were exactly in line with his modeling. He had been warning for weeks that Trump voters’ turnout was surging. As the numbers dribbled out, he could tell that as long as all the votes were counted, Trump would lose. The liberal alliance gathered for an 11 p.m. Zoom call. Hundreds joined; many were freaking out. “It was really important for me and the team in that moment to help ground people in what we had already known was true,” says Angela Peoples, director for the Democracy Defense Coalition. Podhorzer presented data to show the group that victory was in hand. While he was talking, Fox News surprised everyone by calling Arizona for Biden. The public-awareness campaign had worked: TV anchors were bending over backward to counsel caution and frame the vote count accurately. The question then became what to do next. The conversation that followed was a difficult one, led by the activists charged with the protest strategy. “We wanted to be mindful of when was the right time to call for moving masses of people into the street,” Peoples says. As much as they were eager to mount a show of strength, mobilizing immediately could backfire and put people at risk. Protests that devolved into violent clashes would give Trump a pretext to send in federal agents or troops as he had over the summer. And rather than elevate Trump’s complaints by continuing to fight him, the alliance wanted to send the message that the people had spoken. So the word went out: stand down. Protect the Results announced that it would “not be activating the entire national mobilization network today, but remains ready to activate if necessary.” On Twitter, outraged progressives wondered what was going on. Why wasn’t anyone trying to stop Trump’s coup? Where were all the protests? Podhorzer credits the activists for their restraint. “They had spent so much time getting ready to hit the streets on Wednesday. But they did it,” he says. “Wednesday through Friday, there was not a single Antifa vs. Proud Boys incident like everyone was expecting. And when that didn’t materialize, I don’t think the Trump campaign had a backup plan.” Activists reoriented the Protect the Results protests toward a weekend of celebration. “Counter their disinfo with our confidence & get ready to celebrate,” read the messaging guidance Shenker-Osorio presented to the liberal alliance on Friday, Nov. 6. “Declare and fortify our win. Vibe: confident, forward-looking, unified–NOT passive, anxious.” The voters, not the candidates, would be the protagonists of the story. The planned day of celebration happened to coincide with the election being called on Nov. 7. Activists dancing in the streets of Philadelphia blasted Beyoncé over an attempted Trump campaign press conference; the Trumpers’ next confab was scheduled for Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside the city center, which activists believe was not a coincidence. “The people of Philadelphia owned the streets of Philadelphia,” crows the Working Families Party’s Mitchell. “We made them look ridiculous by contrasting our joyous celebration of democracy with their clown show.” The votes had been counted. Trump had lost. But the battle wasn’t over. In Podhorzer’s presentations, winning the vote was only the first step to winning the election. After that came winning the count, winning the certification, winning the Electoral College and winning the transition–steps that are normally formalities but that he knew Trump would see as opportunities for disruption. Nowhere would that be more evident than in Michigan, where Trump’s pressure on local Republicans came perilously close to working–and where liberal and conservative pro-democracy forces joined to counter it. It was around 10 p.m. on election night in Detroit when a flurry of texts lit up the phone of Art Reyes III. A busload of Republican election observers had arrived at the TCF Center, where votes were being tallied. They were crowding the vote-counting tables, refusing to wear masks, heckling the mostly Black workers. Reyes, a Flint native who leads We the People Michigan, was expecting this. For months, conservative groups had been sowing suspicion about urban vote fraud. “The language was, ‘They’re going to steal the election; there will be fraud in Detroit,’ long before any vote was cast,” Reyes says. He made his way to the arena and sent word to his network. Within 45 minutes, dozens of reinforcements had arrived. As they entered the arena to provide a counterweight to the GOP observers inside, Reyes took down their cell-phone numbers and added them to a massive text chain. Racial-justice activists from Detroit Will Breathe worked alongside suburban women from Fems for Dems and local elected officials. Reyes left at 3 a.m., handing the text chain over to a disability activist. As they mapped out the steps in the election-certification process, activists settled on a strategy of foregrounding the people’s right to decide, demanding their voices be heard and calling attention to the racial implications of disenfranchising Black Detroiters. They flooded the Wayne County canvassing board’s Nov. 17 certification meeting with on-message testimony; despite a Trump tweet, the Republican board members certified Detroit’s votes. Election boards were one pressure point; another was GOP-controlled legislatures, who Trump believed could declare the election void and appoint their own electors. And so the President invited the GOP leaders of the Michigan legislature, House Speaker Lee Chatfield and Senate majority leader Mike Shirkey, to Washington on Nov. 20. It was a perilous moment. If Chatfield and Shirkey agreed to do Trump’s bidding, Republicans in other states might be similarly bullied. “I was concerned things were going to get weird,” says Jeff Timmer, a former Michigan GOP executive director turned anti-Trump activist. Norm Eisen describes it as “the scariest moment” of the entire election. The democracy defenders launched a full-court press. Protect Democracy’s local contacts researched the lawmakers’ personal and political motives. Issue One ran television ads in Lansing. The Chamber’s Bradley kept close tabs on the process. Wamp, the former Republican Congressman, called his former colleague Mike Rogers, who wrote an op-ed for the Detroit newspapers urging officials to honor the will of the voters. Three former Michigan governors–Republicans John Engler and Rick Snyder and Democrat Jennifer Granholm–jointly called for Michigan’s electoral votes to be cast free of pressure from the White House. Engler, a former head of the Business Roundtable, made phone calls to influential donors and fellow GOP elder statesmen who could press the lawmakers privately. The pro-democracy forces were up against a Trumpified Michigan GOP controlled by allies of Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, and Betsy DeVos, the former Education Secretary and a member of a billionaire family of GOP donors. On a call with his team on Nov. 18, Bassin vented that his side’s pressure was no match for what Trump could offer. “Of course he’s going to try to offer them something,” Bassin recalls thinking. “Head of the Space Force! Ambassador to wherever! We can’t compete with that by offering carrots. We need a stick.” If Trump were to offer something in exchange for a personal favor, that would likely constitute bribery, Bassin reasoned. He phoned Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan, to see if Primus agreed and would make the argument publicly. Primus said he thought the meeting itself was inappropriate, and got to work on an op-ed for Politico warning that the state attorney general–a Democrat–would have no choice but to investigate. When the piece posted on Nov. 19, the attorney general’s communications director tweeted it. Protect Democracy soon got word that the lawmakers planned to bring lawyers to the meeting with Trump the next day. Reyes’ activists scanned flight schedules and flocked to the airports on both ends of Shirkey’s journey to D.C., to underscore that the lawmakers were being scrutinized. After the meeting, the pair announced they’d pressed the President to deliver COVID relief for their constituents and informed him they saw no role in the election process. Then they went for a drink at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A street artist projected their images onto the outside of the building along with the words THE WORLD IS WATCHING. That left one last step: the state canvassing board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans. One Republican, a Trumper employed by the DeVos family’s political nonprofit, was not expected to vote for certification. The other Republican on the board was a little-known lawyer named Aaron Van Langevelde. He sent no signals about what he planned to do, leaving everyone on edge. When the meeting began, Reyes’s activists flooded the livestream and filled Twitter with their hashtag, #alleyesonmi. A board accustomed to attendance in the single digits suddenly faced an audience of thousands. In hours of testimony, the activists emphasized their message of respecting voters’ wishes and affirming democracy rather than scolding the officials. Van Langevelde quickly signaled he would follow precedent. The vote was 3-0 to certify; the other Republican abstained. After that, the dominoes fell. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the rest of the states certified their electors. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia stood up to Trump’s bullying. And the Electoral College voted on schedule on Dec. 14. There was one last milestone on Podhorzer’s mind: Jan. 6. On the day Congress would meet to tally the electoral count, Trump summoned his supporters to D.C. for a rally. Much to their surprise, the thousands who answered his call were met by virtually no counterdemonstrators. To preserve safety and ensure they couldn’t be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was “strenuously discouraging counter activity,” Podhorzer texted me the morning of Jan. 6, with a crossed-fingers emoji. Trump addressed the crowd that afternoon, peddling the lie that lawmakers or Vice President Mike Pence could reject states’ electoral votes. He told them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building. As lawmakers fled for their lives and his own supporters were shot and trampled, Trump praised the rioters as “very special.” It was his final attack on democracy, and once again, it failed. By standing down, the democracy campaigners outfoxed their foes. “We won by the skin of our teeth, honestly, and that’s an important point for folks to sit with,” says the Democracy Defense Coalition’s Peoples. “There’s an impulse for some to say voters decided and democracy won. But it’s a mistake to think that this election cycle was a show of strength for democracy. It shows how vulnerable democracy is.” The members of the alliance to protect the election have gone their separate ways. The Democracy Defense Coalition has been disbanded, though the Fight Back Table lives on. Protect Democracy and the good-government advocates have turned their attention to pressing reforms in Congress. Left-wing activists are pressuring the newly empowered Democrats to remember the voters who put them there, while civil rights groups are on guard against further attacks on voting. Business leaders denounced the Jan. 6 attack, and some say they will no longer donate to lawmakers who refused to certify Biden’s victory. Podhorzer and his allies are still holding their Zoom strategy sessions, gauging voters’ views and developing new messages. And Trump is in Florida, facing his second impeachment, deprived of the Twitter and Facebook accounts he used to push the nation to its breaking point. As I was reporting this article in November and December, I heard different claims about who should get the credit for thwarting Trump’s plot. Liberals argued the role of bottom-up people power shouldn’t be overlooked, particularly the contributions of people of color and local grassroots activists. Others stressed the heroism of GOP officials like Van Langevelde and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who stood up to Trump at considerable cost. The truth is that neither likely could have succeeded without the other. “It’s astounding how close we came, how fragile all this really is,” says Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director. “It’s like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff–if you don’t look down, you don’t fall. Our democracy only survives if we all believe and don’t look down.” Democracy won in the end. The will of the people prevailed. But it’s crazy, in retrospect, that this is what it took to put on an election in the United States of America. –With reporting by LESLIE DICKSTEIN, MARIAH ESPADA and SIMMONE SHAH Correction appended, Feb. 5: The original version of this story misstated the name of Norm Eisen’s organization.

,,Unlawful ‘malarkey’ robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home on primary day,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        E-Edition TRENDING: A robocall disturbing New Hampshire voters’ weekend calm is the AI election meddling everyone’s been predicting. The message spoofing the voice of President Biden and instructing people not to vote in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary is now under investigation, Gov. Chris Sununu told the Herald in Windham, N.H. Many Granite State voters’ phones rang early Sunday to a voice sounding suspiciously like the 46th president and employing his trademark “no malarkey” phrase. The fake commander-in-chief then went on to tell voters they should save their electoral energy for November’s general election. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the apparently AI-generated Biden voice told callers. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” Sununu, who was making the rounds Monday with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in an attempt to get out the vote before the primary, said that he’s aware of the call and that those responsible will be held accountable. “Our attorney general will completely look into it and into who is behind it. We have rules and laws in place,” he said. Sununu said the call violated state law and is “election interference.” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella’s Office seemed to agree. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely. Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election,” they wrote. Biden’s name will not appear on Tuesday’s ballot, after his campaign and the Democratic National Committee attempted to delay the New Hampshire primary in favor of starting the election cycle in South Carolina. The party was adamant about the issue, warning New Hampshire delegates may be disqualified if they went against party wishes. However, Granite State law says their election must occur before any other. The compromise was Biden sitting out the first primary, with efforts made to add his name as a write-in, and the state’s delegates potentially forfeit at the party’s convention. The DNC even went so far as to tell the state party’s chairman he should inform voters the primary was “meaningless,” only to have Formella’s office respond with a cease and desist order.

,,Biden losing Arab-American voters in swing state,"President Joe Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has sparked anger in a state that helped deliver him victory in 2020. Will there be a political cost? Nadia Ayoub is desperately scrolling through social media, looking for 18-year-old Mohamed Raed Abu Hussain among images coming out of Gaza. ""I zoom into these horrible graphic pictures - I look to see is he in the background, is he somewhere? Are they searching for him? I'm just trying to find any clue that leads to him,"" she says. Mohamed is instantly recognisable - he wears large black glasses and is missing a leg. In 2018, he spent five months with Nadia and her husband Mike, in Dearborn, Michigan, to receive medical treatment. A local facility gave him a prosthetic leg. ""He's the cutest sweetest little kid,"" Mike says. ""I will always love him like a son."" They kept in touch after he returned home to Gaza, and last week the Ayoubs - who are Lebanese Muslims - received a WhatsApp message in which he said he was heading to Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the territory. ""Don't worry about me,"" he wrote. And since then, nothing. On a crisp autumn day, the couple joined dozens of people at an outdoor food truck market to fundraise for civilians in Gaza. They are angry with President Joe Biden over his strong support for Israel's actions in Gaza in the aftermath of the attacks by Hamas on 7 October. This has been made worse for them by the US vetoing a UN call for a ceasefire. Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people and took 241 hostages in the attack. Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which 10,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ""President Biden has blood on his hands,"" says Mike. ""He had my vote - he's lost it forever,"" Nadia adds. It's a sentiment that's widespread across the city, where more than half the population is of Arab heritage. The local Arab American News newspaper is blunt, accompanying a picture of the president with the headline: ""He lost our votes."" In a swing state like Michigan, the numbers will really matter in 2024. Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by 10,000 votes. President Biden took it back from him by about 154,000 votes in 2020. Given there are about 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan, to many it's clear that he needs their votes. But people in Dearborn feel betrayed, says local official Sam Baydoun. ""How can they vote for the president when they see these atrocities on live TV, and he is the one who is enabling this by sending more weapons?"" the county commissioner asks. President Biden's staunch support of Israel is not new, but Mr Baydoun says he is surprised the president visited Tel Aviv during a war and met the Israeli cabinet. A summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was cancelled after a strike on a hospital in Gaza. ""We need an immediate ceasefire. If the election was held today he would not get the Arab vote,"" Mr Baydoun says. The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, says that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%. That would be the first time in nearly 30 years that the Democrats were not the party of choice for Arab American voters. Mr Baydoun is a Democrat, and says the war has made his job tougher: ""How can I tell someone today to vote for President Biden?"" he asks. The dilemma for many in Dearborn is that the alternative is Donald Trump - an unpopular choice given he signed an executive order when in office that briefly barred travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. ""I'm not going to tell people to vote for Trump. Obviously, I will not vote for Trump,"" the commissioner says. Political analyst Larry Sabato says Mr Trump was in some ways a more pro-Israel president, infuriating Arab states by moving the capital to Jerusalem. But that could mean Arab Americans stay at home, even if that benefits Mr Trump, Mr Sabato says. New polling by Siena College for the New York Times suggests Mr Biden loses out to Mr Trump in swing states like Michigan on the question of who is more trusted to handle the Israel-Hamas conflict. Nada Al-Hanooti's job is to turn out the Muslim American vote in Michigan, and he can sense a change in mood. ""I'm hearing friends, and colleagues from other institutions that they're either voting third party or they're staying home."" Ms Al-Hanooti is executive director of Emgage, a civic engagement group that says it was instrumental in helping Mr Biden win Michigan in 2020. ""We made a lot of calls, sent a lot of text messages, did a lot of voter registration, as well as signing people up for absentee ballots. Biden needs the Muslim vote in order to win Michigan."" Now she says she doesn't know what Emgage's strategy will be for 2024. ""The president's job is to be the moral compass of the nation. And right now he's lost trust and credibility with a lot of the American public."" The election is about a year away - a lifetime in politics - will this feeling fade? ""We will not forget,"" Ms Al-Hanooti say. ""This is deep heartbreak."" Israel has described the attack by Hamas as ""our 9/11"". Many in Dearborn who remember the World Trade Center attacks say the aftermath for Arabs reminds them of that time. The fatal stabbing of a six-year old Palestinian boy in Illinois, days after the attack in Israel, has deepened that sense of unease. The boy's landlord is accused of attacking him and his mother because of their religion. In recent days, President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have launched the country's first national strategy to counter Islamophobia. Some in Dearborn have welcomed that but most want Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza - only then will he win back their support. For others, though, the damage is done no matter what he does. In a local coffee shop, Lexi Zeidan - who is Palestinian Christian - says she's even stopped calling Mr Biden the president. He had my vote in 2020 but no longer, she says. ""Why would I ever claim him to be a president - one that doesn't stand up for what's right, that doesn't stand up for a group of people that are defenceless."" The White House has said a ceasefire would enable Hamas to regroup and instead they want a pause in Israeli bombardment to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. This US stance is echoed by the UK, Canada and the European Union. Larry Sabato says it's easy to dismiss the anger clearly evident in Dearborn as heat of the moment, but the Middle East goes to the heart of Arab Americans' priorities as it does for many Jewish Americans. And while Mr Biden can't afford to lose Michigan, Mr Sabato points out that neither can he afford to lose the growing Jewish vote in other swing states like Arizona or Georgia. Nearly 1.1 million Muslim voters cast ballots in the 2020 election, and according to Pew Research, there are about 5.8 million Jews in the US. While data shows the Jewish vote is more diverse, with an increase in those voting for Republicans in 2020, polls suggest most back Democrats and are a base constituency for the party. There isn't any definitive poll so far that tells us how Jewish American voters feel about Biden's handling of the Middle East war but Mr Sabato thinks it will matter. ""A Democrat really has to do well with Jewish Americans and Arab Americans in order to win,"" he says. ""Honestly, the only way around it for Biden is for this war not to be on the front burner a year from now."" Donald Trump is set to soon clinch the Republican nomination. Potential running mates are lining up. The Christian church, known as The Truth, has been recently rocked by a sexual abuse scandal. Audrii Cunningham's body was recovered a week after she went missing from near her family home in Texas. Dr Matthew Knowles says his daughter was inspired by her grandfather's favourite country music as a child. A woman who shot to fame giving parenting advice has been jailed for at least four years for child abuse. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,,A fake Biden robocall is telling New Hampshire primary voters to stay home," MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (Reuters) — As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state’s first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robocall is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home—using a fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden. “It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. . . . voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the call says. The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is investigating what he called an apparent “unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters.” “The Election Law Unit’s investigation is ongoing,” he said. The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name on their ballots. Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was “disinformation” and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden’s write-in campaign will be closely watched amid weak polls for the 81-year-old president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party’s nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden’s name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire’s historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden “voice” is heard using one of his signature phrases, “What a bunch of malarkey.” The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair. Sullivan called the robocall an attempt at election interference, and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated. In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday night. “Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire primary,” she said. She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number without her permission. The explosion of generative AI—which can create text, photos, and videos in response to open-ended prompts—in recent months has spurred both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections, and even possibly overpower humans. The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was “absolutely not” involved in the robocall. The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not involved. The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a reporter on Sunday night. “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing,” the Phillips campaign said. —By Steve Holland, Reuters Now accepting applications for Innovation by Design.

,,Here’s What 13 Biden and Trump Voters Agreed On About 2023,"Something strange happened during our recent Times Opinion focus group, the 18th and final one of 2023. When we asked the participants (13 Democrats, Republicans and independents) how they felt about the economy, we didn’t hear the same chorus of complaints that our other groups pretty consistently intoned all year. Our participants were by no means cheery, but several were upbeat, and even the Trump voters in the group weren’t aggrieved about the economy — so much so that our focus group moderator, Frank Luntz, looked a little surprised and said, “OK, this is not that bad. In fact, this is reasonably good.” Our intent with this focus group was to bring together people who voted for Joe Biden or Donald Trump in 2020 and explore areas where they agreed or disagreed about the year we just went through. The usual partisan divisions fell away in a few places: In addition to seeing some upsides on the economy, several of the Biden and Trump voters expressed concern about ongoing aid to Ukraine, worry about the U.S. border with Mexico and a desire for Mr. Biden not to run for re-election. The group was more divided over Israel and Gaza and over the prosecutions of Mr. Trump. We asked what the participants would say to Mr. Biden if he had been listening to the group. Angela, a 56-year-old Black woman from Califonia who supported him in 2020, said, “Thank you for your many years of service in politics. Go home. Enjoy your wife. Enjoy your life.” Sean, a 39-year-old white man from Georgia who voted for Mr. Biden last time, said, “You got to let somebody else step in. He’s not going to have a good run at this point.” When we asked what they would say to Mr. Trump, Betsy, a 42-year-old white woman from Colorado who backed him in 2020, said, “Please bow out. You’re the best get-out-the-vote machine for the Democratic Party.” At the same time, there were more Trump and Biden voters who said at this point that they thought Mr. Trump would win in November than participants who said they thought Mr. Biden would win. And asked what they thought the country would look like and be like in 2030, there was a mix of optimism and pessimism, but the reactions did not break down strictly along partisan lines. The biggest worry of all was not about the country’s politics but about the health of our culture and the values of younger Americans. Give me a word or phrase that you would use to describe 2023. Tumultuous. Chaotic. Perilous Expensive. Stressful. A roller coaster. Heartbreaking. Let’s do a show of hands. Overall, for the country, was 2023 a good year? [Two people raise a hand.] Having two wars going on at the same time is very depressing. I don’t even recognize my nation anymore. We’ve been kidnapped by extremes on the right and the left, and both political parties exploit this for fundraising and to win elections. Like Paul just pointed out, we’re pawns, and we’re being shown we’re pawns. At least during Covid there was an understanding that people were struggling financially. Now the narrative has shifted to the fact that we’re having a good economy and unemployment is down, when, in all reality, those are numbers that don’t really have anything to do with how most of us are living. Illegal immigration has gotten out of control. Matt, you raised your hand that America was OK in 2023. Tell me why. Well, on balance, I think the country’s been a whole lot worse off in the past. The economy here is pretty good. We have fairly disastrous political divisions, but it’s better now than it was in 2020, for example, or 2021. The country’s kind of calm, compared to what it was. I’m a bit of an optimist. Ask me next year. I’ll probably be frightened as hell. What word would you use to describe the American economy as 2023 ends? Recovering. Bouncing back. Unsustainable. Optimistic. Upward. Deceptive. Uncertain. Hit or miss. Regressive. Recovering. Security. Haves and have-nots. OK, this is not that bad. In fact, this is reasonably good. Why do you think the economy is getting better as we enter into 2024? Inflation is getting better. Well, I’m here in California, and it’s been great to see the gas prices have gone down. Unemployment rates are down. I see more people working. Yes, there are still people that are trying to bounce back from the pandemic. And I was one of those as well, but I feel like I’m in a better place. I see it around my neighborhood. I see it with family members. Infrastructure, jobs. Is there anyone who wants to put forward a contrary point of view? I spend my professional life working with college-bound young people. Too many of my students do not have a sense of hope about the future. I’m 62 years old. I’m at the top of my scale as a schoolteacher. My wife has a superb job. If you’re 21 years old in Jackson County, Ore., and trying to start out and make a living for yourself, you have a very, very tall hill to climb. Every day, I go out downtown, I see more and more homeless folks, more folks asking for help. We have no affordable housing. Here in Phoenix, we had a record number of homeless and unsheltered deaths this summer because people had nowhere to go in the 115-degree heat. I described the economy as unsustainable because we’re approaching a near $34 trillion debt. If you’re well set in your career, have a good savings or work for a company that’s been able to adjust for inflation, then you’re riding it out OK. But for somebody like myself, for example, who just got married, owning a home is something that’s going to take many years for me to do. It’s just me and my wife right now, so we can deal with the $200 to $300 bill to buy food for one week. But once you add one or two children, which will come very soon, that becomes a much more expensive bill that may not be sustainable for so long. OK. Who’s got kids here? If your kids came to you and asked you, “What is America today?” what would you tell them if they asked you to describe the country? I’d probably start out by saying, America, it’s still a big melting pot. It’s very diverse, but there is more of a division between classes So I have three young kids. My oldest is 10. I tell them it’s still a country that is probably one of the freest countries in terms of if you want to achieve something and you put your head down and you just go after it, you can achieve it. I think, unfortunately, the government has gotten way too involved in tilting the scales in favor of companies or different groups. I have three Caucasian boys. And I feel for them because I think there’s a scale being tilted against, unfortunately, Caucasian boys. I would definitely tell them, this is still the greatest country of them all. I’m 56 years old, and I’ve been voting since I was able to vote. I remind them of the importance of voting. I have one son who said, in 2020, “Why vote? Nothing’s going to change.” I said, “You can’t have that attitude. You have to vote. Your voice does matter. Speak and scream it as loud as you possibly can.” And we always had a hope for change. We’re preconditioned to instant gratification. We have so much excess and access that we’re caught between too much information, boredom and too much unbridled emotion. And nobody in that climate gets what they want. And the loudest voices are getting the spotlight on both sides. And that’s making us all think everyone’s crazy. So everyone isn’t crazy? I don’t think so, but I think that crazy sells across the headlines. And I think both sides realize that. Does anyone have a specific positive moment for the country in 2023, where they thought, “This is a great year for America”? Yes, when Ohio and Wisconsin went ahead and said that their states have freedom of choice for women. Inflation, politics, whatever don’t matter if women don’t have a choice — what’s the point? We’re living in tyranny. We’ve just gone too damn far with impeding upon people’s rights. For a lady, that is her right. Guys get to walk away. I am proud of my nation’s support of Ukraine. I see that as a cause that is absolutely essential to the national security of the United States — making the right decision so we don’t make stupid decisions like the United States did in the 1930s and found itself in a global war, with little or no preparation. I think that the U.S. should focus on what’s going on here at home. We need the funds to take care of our homelessness and many other issues. We need to keep putting pressure on European countries to pay more from their end. We can’t guarantee to the taxpayer that our aid is being spent on the right stuff. OK. Let’s now look at the worst moment of 2023 for the country. Does anyone have a worst moment? Just seeing how our border has become a joke. I think the fallout from Oct. 7, to see the rot of the education system in this country and the ugliness that’s come out of it — the pro-Hamas rallies. I’m not necessarily pro-Israel, but the ignorance I’m seeing is kind of horrifying. I’m going to go with a major presidential candidate quoting three war-criminal Communist dictators in a campaign speech and not immediately being shut down by the entire country. That’s pretty bad. And who was that candidate? Donald John Trump. Were you more upset over what he said or over how people reacted or didn't react? Let’s say Jimmy Carter had said that or Ronald Reagan. Their support would have gone to zero, bupkis. And people were cheering him. I was just flabbergasted, absolutely flabbergasted. The worst moment for me was Biden doubling down on his support for Israel. The U.S. taxpayer is funding genocide in Palestine, and Biden is a war criminal for continuing to support Israel. If Israel was trying to commit a genocide, they would have done it already because they have the capacity to. But on the question of what was the worst moment of 2023, I think it was the indictments against President Trump. They’re trying to criminalize the First Amendment. The worst moment for me was attempting to explain to my students why they should continue to trust in the United States when the leader for the Republican nomination for president seems to go lower and lower and lower and lower. I’m old enough to remember the greatest president of my lifetime, Ronald Reagan, who I walked precincts for and cast my first vote for. He said character counts. Character counts. And if the Republican Party can’t understand that, then they are going to reap what they have sown — if not in 2024, in the very near future. OK, let’s move to the 2024 campaign. In an election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who here would support Biden but doesn’t think he’s going to win? I think he’s a better candidate than Trump. But I think Nikki Haley will become the eventual Republican nominee, and I think Biden is very beatable by anybody other than Trump. I would vote for Biden because he’s not Donald Trump. But Biden is facing the headwinds of people’s perception that the economy is bad. There is the whole issue of him being too old. And inflation is going to take him down. This feels more like the 1970s than 2023. I think age does play a part. I think the stress with economics and things going on with his son are definitely weighing on him. He’s been in politics a very long time, but I think he’s ready to retire. As a daughter of somebody who has Alzheimer’s, I watched my dad, who’s similar in age to Biden. And they have very similar mannerisms and characteristics. I cannot trust somebody who has even a minuscule amount of cognitive impairment to run the free country. And I’m not a Donald Trump — I’m not voting for him. I’m not completely happy with Joe Biden as a leader. I think he made a lot of promises, the things that just didn’t come to fruition. And I think there’s some cognitive degeneration there. Donald Trump, I got to say that I had a lot of hope for him. He wasn’t my candidate, but I thought, “You know what? This guy has a chance to really do some good things.” And now I don’t know. I mean, the guy’s just off the deep end. And to this day, it just astonishes me that people can’t see through the smoke screen. Is he that charismatic that he just gets people in a trance and they’ll follow him right off the cliff, or what is it? I just don’t get it. Well, for starters, he has said he would sign the bill banning sex-change operations on kids. That’s a solid answer. We had a wall constructed. He says he will engage in the strongest deportation program since Eisenhower. That’s something. Those are specific things. How many sex-change operations are going to affect you or me or the economy? It’s one of those things where somebody takes ahold of a really minuscule topic and they blow it out of proportion because they have these people who are just scared. Let’s get away from the nonsense of small things. They don’t impact me. They don’t impact you. We talk about walls. The hell with the wall, for crying out loud. Do you know how long we’ve been constructing walls? It ain’t working. I have to disagree on that. There is a caveat to the immigration issue because there is a financial cost to it. That being said, my issues with the two candidates are cognitive impairment with Biden and a megalomaniac with Trump. I don’t disagree with that. I’m not happy with the American system of government, period. Has this system really benefited me? I’m a productive citizen, educated, a big wage earner. I’m not so selfish that I’m only going to look out for myself. I want everyone to do well. This is the richest nation in the world, but guess what? We have homeless people everywhere. Then we get to these situations where we give billions to other nations to fight their wars. I can give you 5,900 reasons why you should worry about Russia, 5,900 reasons why you should worry about Russia. It’s called their nuclear inventory. I can tell you why Vladimir Putin says he’s not at war with Ukraine. He’s at war with the United States and the West. I voted for Biden in the last election, and I will not be voting for him again, regardless of if he’s the Democratic nominee, because of immigration, Israel and Palestine. There’s this sanctimonious voice from the Democrats and the left. They always say, “Here’s the solution. Here’s the solution. Do this good stuff.” But they never see the backlash. It’s always a very one-sided street. And voting for Biden again, that’s like, “Please, sir, can I have another?” No. The last three years have been hell. Democracy is at stake, period. It’s so frightening. I want to maintain a democracy, even though women’s rights are out the door. Does anyone else think that democracy is in genuine peril over the next 12 months? It started off with the Jan. 6 attack. They were whipped up into action by this crazy man. We’ve opened Pandora’s box that it’s OK not to productively debate and disagree but to take arms. We are one election away from losing this country’s democratic and free institutions. I’m afraid that Donald Trump will win and punish anybody in terms of political dissent. He would set up a far more authoritarian approach to American government than we’ve ever seen in this nation before. Donald Trump is not my first choice for president, but the idea that Trump is the threat to democracy is laughable. When we went through the pandemic, who was it that was shutting down your businesses, forcing you to take vaccines in order to stay employed, preventing you from being able to travel unless you had your vaccine passports? That was Democrats. Donald Trump didn’t do enough to rein in people like Dr. Fauci. He could have used emergency powers the way a ton of other Democrats did, like Gavin Newsom did, like Governor Whitmer did. Donald Trump has said out loud exactly what he wants to do to all of our governmental institutions. He wants to change the entire way that civil servants are hired and fired. They’re going to take loyalty tests. That’s exactly what Mussolini did. These are steps that have destroyed democratic governments. People talk about fascism. F.D.R., a Democrat, put people in concentration camps just because they were Japanese. And the history looks lovely upon F.D.R. If Trump were to put people of a certain descent into concentration camps, y’all be causing the riots. OK, I want to say one thing. You all were pretty respectful when we were talking about issues. But the moment we started talking about candidates, you’ve gotten more personal. You’ve gotten more accusatory. Why? We’re conditioned to do that. All of our hopes and dreams are bundled into one person now, no matter which side you’re on. That’s exactly where they want us. That’s exactly where they got us. I think a lot of us agree on what the problems are in this country. We completely disagree on how to solve the problems, and we’re not willing to have conversations with each other on how to actually solve the problems that we actually agree upon. And the larger the government, the smaller the citizen. We feel incredibly small and ignored. First of all, we’ve forgotten how to have political discourse in this country. It never was perfect, but civics, which I teach, is becoming more and more difficult to teach because of the demands that are made on teachers to go in a variety of different directions. I’m a professional. I try to do my best, and I try to treat kids with compassion and kindness, but ultimately, I want them to know how their nation works. Secondly, it is, with me, somewhat personal with Donald Trump, but like I say, I was trained as a historian. I’ve read this book before. And I know how it ends if certain things don’t happen. I really feel, in some ways, we’re in the 1930s again. And we’re looking at free institutions — not only in this nation but around the world — being challenged by people that just simply sell a bill of goods with the loudest voice so they can have power. When I hear a candidate basically tell me what he’s going to do, which means it’s going to ruin our democracy, that’s what scares me. A question for the Biden voters in the group or people who have supported Biden in the past. Looking at 2023, is there something Joe Biden could have done this year that would have made you more likely to vote for him in 2024? Or anything he did that really alienated you? Biden pushed me away when he started working on the wall again, when he had said, “I will not work on the wall.” Yeah, I would say that’s absolutely part of it. He didn’t cancel student loan debt. He continues to support Israel. On the student loan thing, my student loan was forgiven. I just wanted to make that comment. But he really hasn’t touted what he has done. It’s been a lot of focus on what he hasn’t done. OK, a similar question for people who are Republican or leaning Republican in the presidential election. As you look back over 2023, is there anything that another Republican candidate — not Donald Trump — could have done to win you over? Given a choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, I’d vote for Nikki Haley. I don’t think she’s run a perfect campaign. I think that the G.O.P. has deeply swilled on the MAGA Kool-Aid. DeSantis looked kind of appealing, but it’s — I don’t know. I consider myself a moderate with some conservative values. I think he’s actually a little bit too far conservative. I don’t like the extremes either way because that’s why we keep getting here. I would go for somebody more moderate. I would have liked DeSantis if he didn’t seem so stilted. He’s too rehearsed for my tastes. A show-of-hands question for everyone: Trump’s been indicted this past year in four major cases, facing dozens of felony charges. I will not be voting for him this cycle. But it just seems like what’s supposed to be blind justice is not blind anymore. It seems like everybody’s just jumping on the bandwagon to add a charge to it, which I think is backfiring because I think, unfortunately, for me, as a voter, it’s bolstering his support, which I really dislike. OK. Let’s say Donald Trump is listening to this focus group right now. If you had the chance to deliver a message to him, what exactly would you tell him right now, as we leave 2023 and start the election year, 2024? Matt, I’m going to start with you. Oh, thanks for that. Honestly, if I could speak directly to him, I would say, “Have you no shame?” I would say, “Remember, you are supposed to be the president for all” and “turn down the chaos.” “Drop out and endorse Ron DeSantis.” “Stop the divisiveness, and let’s get things better for everyone in this country.” “Please bow out. You’re the best get-out-the-vote machine for the Democratic Party.” “Just have some dignity. Walk away.” I would tell him, “Don’t leave any of these questions unanswered, whether it’s Sean Hannity or anyone else asking about limitations of power and surrendering in the term. Answer those directly. Also, don’t make this second term, if you get it, a revenge tour. Make it a real ‘Make America great for the first time,’ because we have to have two sides that want peace. “People like you have a very hard fall ahead of them.” “Keep up the good work. Don’t let the detractors get at you.” I would say, “Thank you for getting the progressive side of things riled up enough to get out in the streets and demand what we deserve for Black people and Muslim people, Palestinian people.” Americans are very tamped down about protesting, and because of his BS, people got back out in the streets. “Please don’t run again.” “Please go away and let someone else have a chance at this office.” “Mr. President, you’re going to have to let go of 2020. You have a competitor ahead of you that doesn’t know what he’s doing. If you want to actually make America great again, you’re going to have to put your ego aside. The choice is yours.” OK. Now we’re flipping it. Joe Biden is standing behind this computer. The year is almost over. And the election year is about to begin. What advice or what would you say to Joe Biden? John, you’re going to start. “Let somebody else run, but if you do run, I will support you.” If he really wants what’s best for his party, “You gotta let somebody else step in.” He’s not going to have a good run at this point. “Mr. President, you and I are oil and water politically, but I thank you for helping American democracy survive another four years.” “Please retire. You deserve it.” I would say, “We need a permanent cease-fire between Israel and Palestine, and we need to divest American money from the Israeli military.” I’d say, “Thanks, Joe, for forgiving my student loan.” And I would say, “You’ve been great, and I appreciate all your service, and I wish they would leave Hunter alone, too, because it’s really pointless. It’s like Hillary and her tapes. But bow out and let someone else stand up. Bow out.” I’d say, “Let’s concentrate more on improving the lives of Americans. Let’s focus less on spending money outside of the country.” I would encourage him to participate in every single debate and campaign rally that he can possibly do because the more he has to defend his record and speak in public, the less Americans will want to support him. I would say, “Thank you for your many years of service in politics. Go home. Enjoy your wife. Enjoy your life.” It’s interesting because there are Trump voters and Biden voters who think America is going to be worse off. In this case, it doesn’t break down by partisan lines. It breaks down by other attitudes and other priorities. What do you envision America being like in 2030? Politics is downstream from culture. And I don’t see culture, as a whole, making positive changes. So I think we’re going to become more divisive. If you’ve watched the movie “Idiocracy,” I think we’re kind of heading in that direction. So until our culture decides we want to heal as a people, politicians just react to what culture does. I think there will be a greater embrace of more liberal and secular values. By 2030, we’ll be in a much weaker position in the world, greater economic crises and, more importantly than anything else, like Betsy said, cultural decay and rot. I will choose to be optimistic because I’m in the optimism business. We will have a nation that is still the last best hope of Earth, as Mr. Lincoln said, if nothing else because people like me, as educators, are going to light fires under the asses of young people, so they have some idea about why they should continue to believe in this nation, work for this nation and love this nation, whether they are from the right or from the left. I think that we are going to see a revolution and that my optimism lies within the young people as well, knowing that they’re not going to stand for what we’ve stood for for so long. And I believe that we’re going to see a move away from white supremacy, colonialism, individualism and make more space for things like mutual aid and abolition. I’m just curious. Will the revolution be peaceful or violent? I think that we’re being forced into having a violent revolution because of how cops respond to protesters. Chris, your expectations for the US in 2030? I think the divisiveness is going to improve. I’m relying upon some of the young folks who haven’t been tainted. I think that their ability to think out of the box, to organize, is going to be pivotal. And I think they’re going to see through some of these smoke screens and actually elect people who they think are going to do the right thing, so I’m optimistic. America in Focus seeks to hear and understand the views of cross-sections of Americans whose voices are often not heard in opinion journalism. This discussion was moderated by a focus group veteran, Frank Luntz, and the New York Times deputy Opinion editor, Patrick Healy. Mr. Luntz has done similar work over the years for Republican candidates and partisan groups. He chose the participants. (Times Opinion paid him for the work.)

,,2020 United States presidential election," Donald Trump
Republican Joe Biden
Democratic The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence.[9] The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[10] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[11] In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics, Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[d] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in presidential primary history, to runner-up Bill Weld's one delegate in the Republican primaries.[12] Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others; the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[13][14][15] Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail.[16] Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[17][18] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[19] Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since 1992, in Arizona since 1996, and in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2008.[20][21] Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[22][23][24][25][26] attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results,[27] falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states,[28][29][30][31] in what was described by many as an attempted coup d'état. Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[32][33] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[34][35][36] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[37] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing numerous lawsuits in several states (most of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[38][39][40] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[41] pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a phone call that later became widely publicized) and legislators to change results,[42] pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election ""corrupt"" and intervene,[43][44] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[45][46] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[47] With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to ""fight like hell"", a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count.[48][49][50] On January 7, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name.[51][52][53] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021; in a break from tradition, Trump did not attend his successor's inauguration.[54] Trump was indicted on August 1, 2023, on four counts relating to conspiring to overturn the results. Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[55] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals. The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various state and local-level elections.[56] The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.[57][58] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court[59][60] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020.[61] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election,[62][63] and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.[64] An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October 6.[65] The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine's electors (Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way).[66] While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first-choice votes statewide and in each district, use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third-party or independent candidates.[67] On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government.[68][69][70] The newly elected Congress, with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes, which began on January 6, 2021, was interrupted by the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and finished the following day.[71] The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the apportionment of House seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 United States census occurred, and the states conducted redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting, although some states have redistricting commissions. Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.[72] The party that won the 2020 presidential election could have also won a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts, which would stay in effect until 2032.[73]    The Democratic Party chose its nominee in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 5, 2020, when he secured enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the national convention.[74] Biden picked Kamala Harris as his vice-presidential nominee, and the ticket was formally nominated at the convention on August 18.[75]   Incumbent president Donald Trump and incumbent vice president Mike Pence were able to easily secure the nomination after Trump received enough delegates in the 2020 Republican presidential primaries. They were formally nominated at the Republican National Convention on August 24, 2020.[76][77] Jo Jorgensen, who was the running mate of author Harry Browne in 1996, received the Libertarian nomination at the national convention on May 23, 2020.[78] She achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[79] Howie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee of the Green Party on June 21, 2020, and was officially nominated by the party on July 11, 2020.[80][81] Hawkins secured ballot access in 29 states and the District of Columbia, representing 381 electoral votes, and write-in access in 16 more states, representing 130 electoral votes.[82][83][e] The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July 13–16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[86][87][88] but was delayed to August 17–20 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[89] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in-person format, with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site.[90] On August 5, the in-person portion of the convention was scaled down even further; major speeches, including Biden's, were switched to a virtual format.[91] The 2020 Republican National Convention took place from August 24–27 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and various remote locations. Originally, a three-day convention was planned to be held in North Carolina, but due to North Carolina's insistence that the convention follow COVID-19 social distancing rules, the speeches and celebrations were moved to Jacksonville, Florida (official convention business was still contractually obligated to be conducted in Charlotte).[92][93] Due to the worsening situation with regards to COVID-19 in Florida, the plans there were cancelled, and the convention was moved back to Charlotte in a scaled-down capacity.[94] The 2020 Libertarian National Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Austin, Texas, over Memorial Day weekend from May 22 to 25,[95][96] but all reservations at the JW Marriott Downtown Austin for the convention were cancelled on April 26 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[97] The Libertarian National Committee eventually decided the party would hold two conventions, one online from May 22–24 to select the presidential and vice-presidential nominees and one at a physical convention in Orlando, Florida, from July 8–12 for other business.[98] The 2020 Green National Convention was originally to be held in Detroit, Michigan, from July 9 to 12.[88] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention was instead held online, without a change in date.[99] The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts on December 18, 2019.[100] The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,[101] and ended on February 5, resulting in acquittal by the United States Senate.[102] This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[103][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[105][106] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[107] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[108][109] Several events related to the 2020 presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and its effects, such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.[110][111] On March 12, Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.[112] The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington, D.C.[113] Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,[114] Kentucky,[115] Louisiana,[116] Ohio,[117] and Maryland.[118] As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates had halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID-19 concerns. Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation, could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.[119][120][121] Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID-19-related issues, including long lines at polling places, greatly increased requests for absentee ballots, and technology issues.[122] Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic, the number of polling places was often greatly reduced. Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative, but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested.[123] The March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail-in voting. By May, Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud, a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations.[124][125] Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus, became a major campaign issue for both parties.[126][127] On April 6, the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers's request to move the state's spring elections to June. As a result, the elections, which included a presidential primary, went ahead on April 7 as planned.[128] At least seven new cases of COVID-19 were traced to this election. Voting-rights advocates expressed fear of similar chaos on a nationwide scale in November, recommending states move to expand vote-by-mail options.[129] On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[130] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a ""flop"", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[131] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[132] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[133] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[134] On October 2, 2020, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a positive test from his senior advisor, Hope Hicks, as part of the larger COVID-19 outbreak among White House personnel. Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine, which prevented Trump from further campaigning, notably at campaign rallies.[135][136][137] Later that day, the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever, where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment.[138][139] Trump's diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump; Biden tested negative.[140][141] Trump was discharged from the hospital on October 5.[142] Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID-19, an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump, due to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings.[143][144] Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies, which were a major part of his campaign. As a result of Trump contracting COVID-19, Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him.[145][146] On October 12, one week after his discharge from the hospital, Trump resumed in-person rallies.[142] Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies, sometimes two or three in a day. His rallies were criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing, and some polls suggested that voters saw him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees.[147][148] U.S. officials accused Russia, China, and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 United States elections.[149][150] On October 4, 2019, Microsoft announced that ""Phosphorus"", a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government, had attempted to compromise e-mail accounts belonging to journalists, U.S. government officials and the campaign of a U.S. presidential candidate.[151][152] The American Government owned Voice of America reported in April 2020 that ""Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called 'spear-phishing' attacks on American political targets ahead of the 2020 vote."" Chinese spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations and said he would ""hope the people of the U.S. not drag China into its electoral politics"".[153] On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected.[154][155] The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. On February 21, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed U.S. officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, ""I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.""[156] Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior.[157] In a February 2020 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support Trump's reelection campaign; Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat, and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, for allowing the briefing to go forward.[158][159] China and some government-linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump,[160] though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community.[159][161] On October 21, threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states. The emails warned, ""You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.""[162] Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails, using a spoofed return address, had been sent by Iran. He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data, possibly from publicly available information, and ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy."" A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation.[163] In his announcement, Ratcliffe said Iran's intent had been ""to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump"", raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump. It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe's prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage; he had added it on his own.[164] On November 18, 2021, the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information.[165] Throughout the election period, several Colombian lawmakers and the Colombian ambassador to the United States issued statements supporting the Donald Trump campaign, which has been viewed as potentially harmful to Colombia–United States relations.[166][167] On October 26, the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, requested that Colombian politicians abstain from getting involved in the elections.[168] The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee accepted a $100,000 donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.[169][170] Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of 2016's election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty-first century attacks, and in fact conducted what were characterized as preemptive counter-strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in large-scale coordination of hacking,[171] and some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities. Nonetheless, after his dismissal, in a December 2020 interview, Chris Krebs, the Trump administration's director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described monitoring Election Day from CISA's joint command center along with representatives from the military's United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment, and representatives of state and local governments, as well as his agency's analysis preceding and after that day, saying, ""It was quiet. There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on, before, or after November third.""[172] Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote-counting in some areas, Krebs also affirmed that, ""All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America.""[172] Acts of foreign interference included Russian state-directed application of computational propaganda approaches, more conventional state-sponsored Internet propaganda, smaller-scale disinformation efforts, ""information laundering"" and ""trading up the chain"" propaganda tactics employing some government officials, Trump affiliates, and US media outlets.[173] During the campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews, and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him.[174][175][176] In July 2020, Trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results, just as he did in the 2016 presidential election, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that ""I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.""[177][178][179][180] Trump repeatedly claimed that ""the only way"" he could lose would be if the election was ""rigged"" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[181][182] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud;[183][184][185] at one point, Trump said, ""We'll see what happens ... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.""[186] Trump's statements have been described as a threat ""to upend the constitutional order"".[187] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, who was appointed by Trump, testified under oath that the FBI has ""not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise"".[188] A number of congressional Republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power, but declined to criticize Trump for his comments.[189] On September 24, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.[190] Trump also stated he expected the Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute, reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[191] In April 2020, Biden suggested that Trump might try to delay the election, saying he ""is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held"".[192][193] On July 30, Trump tweeted that ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history"" and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person. Experts[who?] indicated that, for the election to be legally delayed, such a decision must be made by Congress.[194][195] And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice-presidential terms at January 20, a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment.[196][197] Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common, with 25% of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places.[199] An August 2020 state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 – more than double the number in 2016.[200] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots.[201] In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots, the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy, the newly installed United States Postmaster General, including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail,[202] which caused delays in delivering mail,[203] and dismantling and removing hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines from postal centers.[204] On August 18, after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes, DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election. He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail-sorting machines and collection boxes.[205] The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots.[206] Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting, he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election.[207] In August 2020, Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail.[208] The Trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in Pennsylvania in locations other than an election office, and also sought to ""block election officials from counting mail-in ballots if a voter forgets to put their mail-in ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot return-envelope"".[209] The Trump campaign and the Republican Party both failed to produce any evidence of vote-by-mail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so.[209] On Election Day, a judge ordered mail inspectors to search ""mail facilities in .... key battleground states"" for ballots.[210] The agency refused to comply with the order and nearly 7% of ballots in USPS facilities on Election Day were not processed in time.[211] The Federal Election Commission, which was created in 1974 to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections, has not functioned since July 2020 due to vacancies in membership. In the absence of a quorum, the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions.[212] As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency's enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action.[213] As of September 1, 2020, Trump had not nominated anyone to fill the FEC vacancies.[214] On September 18, 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately said the precedent he had set regarding the Merrick Garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible, setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign.[215] The death of Justice Ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the Democrats and Republicans.[216][217] The president,[218] vice president,[219] and several Republican members of Congress said a full Supreme Court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election.[220][221] On September 26, the day after Justice Ginsburg's body lay in state at the Capitol, Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate, Amy Coney Barrett.[222] After four days of confirmation hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October 22,[223] and on October 26, Barrett was confirmed on a party-line vote of 52–48, with no Democrats voting for her confirmation.[224] This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election, and the first Supreme Court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party.[224] It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U.S. history.[225][226] On October 11, 2019, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of 2020.[232] The first, moderated by Chris Wallace, took place on September 29, and was co-hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.[233] The debate was originally to be hosted at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[233][234] Biden was generally held to have won the first debate,[235][236][237] with a significant minority of commentators deeming it a draw.[238][239] One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo-fascist group Proud Boys, instead responding that they should ""stand back and stand by"".[240][241][242] On the next day, Trump told reporters the group should ""stand down"" while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was.[243][244] The debate was described as ""chaotic and nearly incoherent"" because of Trump's repeated interruptions, causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates.[245] The vice presidential debate was held on October 7, 2020, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.[246] The debate was widely held to be subdued, with no clear victor.[247][248] One incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vice-president Pence's head, and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes.[249][250] The second debate was initially set to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the university withdrew in June 2020, over concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.[251] The planned debate was rescheduled for October 15 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami; due to Trump contracting COVID-19, the CPD announced on October 8 that the debate would be held virtually, in which the candidates would appear from separate locations. Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate, and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled.[252][253] The third scheduled debate took place on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was moderated by Kristen Welker.[254][255] The changes to the debate rules, which included the candidates' microphones being muted while the other was speaking,[256] resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate.[257] Welker's performance as moderator was praised, with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other.[258] Biden was generally held to have won the debate, though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree.[259][260][261] The Free & Equal Elections Foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates, one on October 8, 2020, in Denver, Colorado,[266] and another on October 24, 2020, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[267] The following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from September 2019 to November 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, had an average polling lead of 7.9 percentage points over incumbent President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden would win the national popular vote by 4.4 percentage points. Calculated averages are not comparable to those for the Biden vs. Trump polls. As polling with third parties has been very limited, the polls included in the average are often different. The following graph depicts the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in each swing state in the poll aggregators from March 2020 to the election, with the election results for comparison. OpenSecrets estimated the total cost of the 2020 election nearly $14 billion, making it the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle.[268] The COVID-19 pandemic was a major issue of the campaign, with Trump's responses being heavily criticized. The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection, including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them, but has also encouraged their use at times.[269] During the campaign, Trump held many events across the country, including in COVID-19 hotspots, where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing; at the same time, he mocked those who wore face masks.[270][271][272] Biden advocated for the expansion of federal funding, including funding under the Defense Production Act for testing, personal protective equipment, and research.[273] Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act to control the distribution of masks and ventilators,[274] but his response plan relied significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of 2020.[273] At the second presidential debate, Trump claimed Biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited China, but Biden responded that he had not been referring to this decision.[275] Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency's first three years, with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fifty-year low. Additionally, he has touted the 2020 third-quarter rebound, in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of 33.1%, as evidence of the success of his economic policies.[276] Biden responded to Trump's claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump's presidency was inherited from the Obama administration, and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic, including the need for 42 million Americans to file for unemployment.[277] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered income taxes for many Americans and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, were a major component of Trump's economic policy. Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class. Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 per year, while keeping the reduced taxes on lower-income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of 39.6%. In response, Trump said Biden's plans would destroy retirement accounts and the stock market.[278] Trump and Biden's views on environmental policy differ significantly. Trump stated that climate change is a hoax, although he also called it a serious subject.[279] Trump condemned the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process. Biden planned to rejoin it and announced a $2 trillion plan to combat climate change. Biden had not fully accepted the Green New Deal. Biden did not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land. In a debate, Trump claimed Biden wanted to ban it altogether. Trump's other environmental policies included the removal of methane emission standards, and an expansion of mining.[280] Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign. While Biden, as well as other candidates, promised protection of the Affordable Care Act, progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with Medicare for All. Biden's plan involves adding a public option to the American healthcare system,[281] and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care, which was removed from the Affordable Care Act by the 2017 tax cut bill,[282] as well as restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. Trump announced plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, calling it ""too expensive"", but he did not say what would replace it.[283] At the time of the election, the Trump administration and Republican officials from 18 states had a lawsuit before the Supreme Court, asking the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[284] As a result of the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality against African Americans, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid-2020. This was followed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which protested police brutality against black people, and became a central point of the 2020 presidential campaign.[285] Protests were mostly peaceful; fewer than 4% involved property damage or violence (with most of the latter directed at BLM protesters themselves).[286] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism, and looting caused about $1–2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[287][288] In response, Trump and the Republicans suggested sending in the military to counter the protests, which was criticized, especially by Democrats, as heavy-handed and potentially illegal.[289] Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters confronting diners in a restaurant as ""thugs"",[290] and called a street painting of the slogan a ""symbol of hate"".[291] Particularly controversial was a photo-op Trump took in front of St. John's Church in Washington, D.C., before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area.[282] Biden condemned Trump for his actions against protestors; he described George Floyd's words ""I can't breathe"" as a ""wake-up call for our nation"". He also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president, and establish a uniform use of force standard, as well as other police reform measures.[292] More than 158 million votes were cast in the election.[307] More than 100 million of them were cast before Election Day by early voting or mail ballot, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[308] The election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since 1900,[309] with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008.[310] The Biden–Harris ticket received more than 81 million votes, the most votes ever in a U.S. presidential election.[10][11] It was also the ninth consecutive presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not receive a popular vote majority by a double-digit margin over the losing major party nominee(s), continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U.S. history, which began in 1988 and in 2016 eclipsed the previous longest sequence, that from 1876 through 1900.[311][note 1][312] In 2020, 58 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties,[313] a decline from 61 percent in 2016.[314] Trump became the eleventh incumbent in the country's history, and the first since 1992, to lose a bid for a second term. Biden's 51.3% of the popular vote was the highest for a challenger to an incumbent president since 1932.[315][316][317][m] Biden is the sixth vice president to become president without succeeding to the office on the death or resignation of a previous president.[318] Additionally, Trump's loss marked the third time an elected president lost the popular vote twice, the first being John Quincy Adams in the 1820s and Benjamin Harrison in the 1880s and 1890s.[319] This was the first time since 1980, and the first for Republicans since 1892 that a party was voted out after a single four-year term. This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re-election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than he did in the previous election, after 1828. It is also the third election in which the two candidates that received electoral votes carried the same number of states. This also happened in 1880 and 1848. Biden won 25 states, the District of Columbia, and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump won 25 states and one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. This result was exactly the reverse of Trump's victory, 306 to 232, in 2016 (excluding faithless electors).[320] Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since 1992 and in Arizona since 1996,[20] and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since 1992 and Ohio since 1960, casting doubt on Ohio's continued status as a bellwether state.[321] Biden carried five states won by Trump in 2016: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also became the first Democrat since 2008 to carry Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, winning one electoral vote from the state. Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in 2016. Biden's three gains in the Rust Belt—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall, a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from 1992 to 2012, broken by Trump in 2016 when he flipped those three Rust Belt states.[322][323][324][325] Nevertheless, amidst Trump's national and electoral defeat, his scoring decisive victories in Ohio, Iowa, and Florida for the second time, after their having backed Obama twice, has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states.[326][327] In light of the attempts to contest the election results, an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome. If Biden's three narrowest state victories—Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point—had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[328][329] causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally. A similar situation occurred in 2016, when a shift of 0.77% or less in each of the three most closely contested states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), or about 77,000 votes, would have resulted in the popular-vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College.[330] Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties. This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban–rural divide.[331] While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[332] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[332] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[332] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[332] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[333] Biden became the oldest president ever elected, besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984, and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016. Major news organizations project a state for a candidate when there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning the state. Election projections are made by decision teams of political scientists and data scientists.[19] On the morning of November 7 at approximately 11:30 a.m. EST, roughly three and a half days after polls had closed, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, the Associated Press, CNN, and Fox News all called the election for Biden, based on projections of votes in Pennsylvania showing him leading outside of the recount threshold (0.5% in that state).[334][335][336][337][338][339] That evening, Biden and Harris gave victory speeches in Wilmington, Delaware.[340] On the invitation of the U.S. State Department, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which has been monitoring U.S. elections since 2002 (as it does for major elections in all other OSCE member countries), sent 102 observers from 39 countries.[341][342][343] The task force consisted of long-term observers from the ODIHR office (led by former Polish diplomat Urszula Gacek) deployed to 28 states from September on and covering 15 states on election day, and a group of European lawmakers acting as short-term observers (led by German parliamentarian Michael Georg Link), reporting from Maryland, Virginia, California, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and D.C.[341][343] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was scaled down to a ""limited election observation mission"" from the originally planned 100 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers.[341] An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors ""expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President's repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process, and postal vote in particular.""[341][344] On the day after the election, the task force published preliminary findings,[342] with part of the summary stating: The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.[345] Link said that ""on the election day itself, we couldn't see any violations"" at the polling places visited by the observers.[342] The task force also found ""nothing untoward"" while observing the handling of mail-in ballots at post offices, with Gacek being quoted as saying: ""We feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground. The system has held up well.""[343] The OSCE's election monitoring branch published a more comprehensive report in early 2021.[343][346] Candidates are listed individually below if they received more than 0.1% of the popular vote. Popular vote totals are from the Federal Election Commission report.[1] Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates by congressional districts. The winner of each congressional district gets one electoral vote for the district. The winner of the statewide vote gets two additional electoral votes.[352][353] States where the margin of victory was under 1% (37 electoral votes; all won by Biden): States where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (86 electoral votes; 42 won by Biden, 44 by Trump): States/districts where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (80 electoral votes; 17 won by Biden, 63 by Trump): Blue denotes states or congressional districts won by Democrat Joe Biden; red denotes those won by Republican Donald Trump. Counties with highest percentage of Democratic vote:[354] Counties with highest percentage of Republican vote: Voter demographic data for 2020 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by 15,590 voters in person as well as by phone.[356] The Brookings Institution released a report entitled ""Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win"" on November 12, 2020. In it, author William H. Frey attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college-educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older White without college degrees.[359] Frey says the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among White and older Americans.[359] Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 16%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since 1980. Democrats won the Latino vote by 32%, which is the smallest margin since 2004, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.[359] Biden reduced the Republican margin of white men without college educations from 48% to 42%, and the Democrats made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women. People age 18 to 29 registered a rise in Democratic support between 2016 and 2020, with the Democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19% to 24%.[359] Post-election analysis using verified voter data found the Associated Press's Votecast was more accurate than the exit polls.[360][361] Biden won 65% of the Latino vote according to Edison Research, and 63% according to the Associated Press. Voto Latino reported that the Latino vote was crucial to the Biden victory in Arizona. 40% of Latino voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016, and 73% of those Latino voters voted for Biden (438,000 voters).[362] Florida and Texas, which have large Latino populations, were carried by Trump. In Florida, Trump won a majority of Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Florida.[363] The Latino vote was still crucial to enable Biden to carry states such as Nevada.[364] Latino voters were targeted by a major Spanish-language disinformation campaign in the final weeks of the election, with various falsehoods and conspiracy theories being pushed out by WhatsApp and viral social media posts.[365][366][367] Demographic patterns emerged having to do with country of origin and candidate preference. Pre- and post-election surveys showed Biden winning Latinos of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican,[368] and Spanish heritage,[369] while Trump carried Latinos of Cuban heritage. Data from Florida showed Biden holding a narrow edge among South Americans.[370] Biden won 87% of the Black vote, while Trump won 12%.[371] Biden's advantage among Black voters was crucial in the large cities of Pennsylvania and Michigan; the increase in the Democratic vote in Milwaukee County of about 28,000 votes was more than the 20,000-vote lead Biden had in the state of Wisconsin. Almost half Biden's gains in Georgia came from the four largest counties – Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb – all in the Atlanta metro area with large Black populations.[372] Trump improved his overall share of the Black vote from 2016 by 4% and doubled the Black vote that Mitt Romney received in 2012.[373][374][371] Polls showed that 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) voters supported Biden/Harris, while 28% supported Trump/Pence. Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, said Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump by about a 2:1 margin. Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Indian Americans, and Chinese Americans favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to Vietnamese Americans and Filipino Americans.[375] Many voters were turned off by Trump's language some of which was widely considered racist such as (""China virus"" and ""kung flu"") but, according to Vox reporter Terry Nguyen, many Vietnamese voters (and especially elderly, South Vietnamese migrants who populated coastal centers in the 1970s) appreciated his strong anti-China stance.[376] Data from FiveThirtyEight indicated 65% of Indian American voters backed Joe Biden, and 28% supported Donald Trump.[375] Some Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[377] In a speech given to 50,000 Indian-Americans during his 2019 visit to the US, Modi praised Trump with remarks that were interpreted as an indirect endorsement of his candidacy.[378] Indian right-wing organizations like the Hindu Sena had performed special havans and pujas for Trump's electoral victory.[379] Pre-election voter surveys by Indian Country Today found 68% of American Indian and Alaska Native voters supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[380] In particular, the Navajo Reservation, which spans a large quadrant of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, delivered up to 97% of their votes per precinct to Biden,[381] while overall support for Biden was between 60 and 90% on the Reservation.[382] Biden also posted large turnout among Havasupai, Hopi, and Tohono O'odham peoples,[383] delivering a large win in New Mexico and flipping Arizona. In Montana, while the state went for Trump overall, Biden won counties overlapping reservations of the Blackfeet, Fort Belknap, Crow and Northern Cheyenne.[384] The same pattern held in South Dakota, with most of the counties overlapping the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes going for Biden. For example, in Oglala Lakota County, which overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Biden won 88% of the vote.[384] Trump's strongest performance among Native tribes was with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, where he won a strong majority in Robeson County and flipped Scotland County from Democratic to Republican.[385] Trump had campaigned in Lumberton, in Robeson County, and had promised the Lumbees federal recognition.[385] Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls overestimated him by three to four points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than 2016's error (one or two points).[386] The numbers represented the highest level of error since the 1980 presidential election.[387] This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls,[388] as well as the House elections, where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted. Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states, including Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states. The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans.[386] According to The New York Times, polling misses have been attributed to, among other issues, reduced average response to polling; the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters; and pandemic-related problems, such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID-19.[386] According to CNN, research presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research indicated one of the primary problems was an inability by pollsters to include a certain segment of Trump supporters, either due to inaccessibility or lack of participation.[387] New Statesman data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately, leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group.[389] Election analyst Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote that the polling error was completely normal by historical standards and disputes the narrative that polls were wrong.[390] Election night, November 3, ended without a clear winner, as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted, including in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.[391] Results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mail-in ballots.[392] In a victory declared after midnight, Trump won the swing state of Florida by over three percentage points, an increase from his 1.2 percentage point margin in 2016, having seen significant gains in support among the Latino community in Miami-Dade County.[393] Shortly after 12:30 a.m. EST, Biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted, and said he believed he was ""on track to win this election"".[394][395] Shortly before 2:30 a.m. EST, Trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters, falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting, saying that continued counting was ""a fraud on the American people"" and ""we will be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.""[396][397] The Biden campaign denounced these attempts, claiming the Trump campaign was engaging in a ""naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens"".[398] In Pennsylvania, where the counting of mail-in ballots began on election night, Trump declared victory on November 4 with a lead of 675,000 votes, despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted. Trump also declared victory in North Carolina and Georgia, despite many ballots being uncounted.[399] At 11:20 p.m. EST on election night, Fox News projected Biden would win Arizona, with the Associated Press making the same call at 2:50 a.m. EST on November 4;[400][401] several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call.[402][403] By the evening of November 4, the Associated Press reported that Biden had secured 264 electoral votes by winning Michigan and Wisconsin, with Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada remaining uncalled.[404] Biden had a 1% lead in Nevada[405] and maintained a 2.3% lead in Arizona by November 5,[406] needing only to win Nevada and Arizona or to win Pennsylvania to obtain the necessary 270 electoral votes.[404] Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts[407] attributed this to several factors, including a ""red mirage"" of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.[408][409][410] On November 5, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote-counting in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote, but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the vote-counting room.[411] Also that day, a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign which alleged that in Georgia, late-arriving ballots were counted. The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[412] Meanwhile, a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign's lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[413] That judge also noted the official complaint did not state ""why"", ""when, where, or by whom"" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[414] On November 6, Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots, and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden.[415] Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November 6 that a recount would be held in Georgia. At that point, Georgia had not seen ""any widespread irregularities"" in this election, according to the voting system manager of the state, Gabriel Sterling.[416] Also, on November 6, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order requiring officials in Pennsylvania to segregate late-arriving ballots, amid a dispute as to whether the state's Supreme Court validly ordered a 3-day extension of the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive.[417] Several Republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court in subsequent days agreeing with the Pennsylvania Republican Party's view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline.[418] Protests against Trump's challenges to the election results occurred in Minneapolis, Portland, New York, and other cities. Police in Minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway. In Portland, the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police.[426] At the same time, groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix, Detroit, and Philadelphia, shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground.[426] In Arizona, where Biden's lead was shrinking as more results were reported, the pro-Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted, while in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump's lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported, they called for the count to be stopped.[427] Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent. Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked.[430][431] On November 9 and 10, The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state; all 45 of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud. Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic, the record turnout, and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots.[33] On November 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a statement calling the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history"" and noting ""[t]here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""[35] Five days later, Trump fired the director of CISA, whom he had appointed in 2018.[432] As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day, Trump falsely asserted that there was ""tremendous corruption and fraud going on"", adding: ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""[433] Trump has repeatedly claimed as suspicious that mail-in ballots showed significantly more support for Biden.[434] This blue shift phenomenon is believed to occur because more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail, and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states. Leading up to the 2020 election, the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual, as Trump's attacks on mail-in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots.[435] In early January 2021, Trump falsely proclaimed that he had by rights won all 50 states in the presidential election and a 535 to 3 electoral college victory. On January 2, during his phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, Trump said, ""As you know, every single state. We won every state; we won every statehouse in the country... But we won every single statehouse.""[436] Two days later, on January 4, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton, Georgia, supporting Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. During his speech at the rally, Trump again asserted that he won ""every single state"", and ""We win every state, and they're going to have this guy [Biden] be President?""[437] Many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading. In Fulton County, Georgia, the number of votes affected was 342, with no breakdown of which candidates they were for.[438] A viral video of a Pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting, while a video claiming to show a man taking ballots illegally to a Detroit counting center was found to show a photographer transporting his equipment.[439][440] Another video of a poll watcher being turned away in Philadelphia was found to be real, but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved.[441] A viral tweet claimed 14,000 votes in Wayne County, Michigan, were cast by dead people, but the list of names included was found to be incorrect.[442] The Trump campaign and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson also claimed a man named James Blalock had voted in Georgia despite having died in 2006, but in fact his 94-year-old widow had registered and voted as Mrs. James Blalock.[443] In Erie, Pennsylvania, a postal worker who claimed the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day later admitted he had fabricated the claim. Prior to this recantation, Republican senator Lindsey Graham cited the claim in a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation, and a GoFundMe page created for the postal worker ""patriot"" raised $136,000.[444] Days after Biden had been declared the winner, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted without evidence that the Democratic Party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting.[445] Republican former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated on Fox News, ""I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election.""[446] Appearing at a press conference outside a Philadelphia landscaping business as Biden was being declared the winner, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable.[447] Responding to Giuliani, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said: ""Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed, and repeating these false attacks is reckless. No active lawsuit even alleges, and no evidence presented so far has shown, widespread problems.""[33] One week after the election, Republican Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud, stating, ""I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread."" He added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in Philadelphia but ""not a single one of them voted in Philadelphia after they died."" Trump derided Schmidt, tweeting, ""He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption & dishonesty. We win!""[448] Attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges could not produce valid evidence to support the allegations. In one instance, a Trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in Detroit on the basis of a Republican poll watcher's claim that an unidentified person had said ballots were being backdated; Michigan Court of Appeals judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the argument as ""inadmissible hearsay within hearsay"".[449][450] Some senior attorneys at law firms working for Trump, notably Jones Day, expressed concerns that they were undermining the integrity of American elections by advancing arguments without evidence.[451] Trump and his lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly made the false claim that the Toronto, Ontario-based firm Dominion Voting Systems, which had supplied voting machines for 27 states, was a ""communist"" organization controlled by billionaire George Soros, former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez (who died in 2013), or the Chinese Communist Party, and that the machines had ""stolen"" hundreds of thousands of votes from Trump. Defamatory rumors about the company circulated on social media, amplified by more than a dozen tweets or retweets by Trump. The disinformation campaign prompted threats and harassment against Dominion employees.[454] A December 2020 poll showed 77% of Republicans believed widespread fraud occurred during the election, along with 35% of independent voters.[455] Overall, 60% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 34% did not, and 6% were unsure. Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result, with 62% of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, while 37% did not.[456] This split in popular opinion remained largely stable, with a January 10, 2021, poll commissioned by ABC News showing 68% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate and 32% did not.[457] These numbers remained largely stagnant, with a June 2021 poll from Monmouth showing 61% believed Biden won fair and square, 32% believed he won due to fraud, and 7% were unsure.[458] More than a year later, public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant, with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that 65% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 33% believed it was not legitimate, and 2% were unsure. The same poll also found that 72% of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were attacking democracy, while 25% thought they were protecting democracy, and 3% were unsure.[459] A March 2022 poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that 52% of voters think that it is likely that cheating ""affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election."" while 40% of voters believe that it is unlikely. 33% say that cheating was very likely, 19% say it was somewhat likely, 13% say it was somewhat unlikely, and 27% say it was very unlikely.[460] Motivated by the myth of widespread fraud, Republican state lawmakers initiated a push to make voting laws more restrictive.[461] After the election, the Trump campaign filed lawsuits in multiple states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.[462] Lawyers and other observers noted the suits were unlikely to affect the outcome. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt said, ""There's literally nothing that I've seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result.""[463] Some law firms moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election.[464] Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn Biden's win in Georgia through litigation; suits by the Trump campaign and allies were rejected by both the Georgia Supreme Court[465] and by federal courts.[466][467] Trump also sought to overturn Biden's win by pressuring Kemp to call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly so state legislators could override the Georgia election results and appoint a pro-Trump slate of electors, an entreaty rebuffed by Kemp.[468] On December 20, Giuliani filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to overturn the results of the Pennsylvania election and direct the state legislature to appoint electors. The Supreme Court was regarded as very unlikely to grant this petition, and in any case Biden would still have a majority of Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania.[469] The Court set the deadline for reply briefs from the respondents for January 22, 2021, two days after President Elect Biden's inauguration.[470] On December 9, Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, asking the court to overturn the results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Attorneys general of seventeen other states also signed onto the lawsuit.[471][472][473] 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives, more than two-thirds of the Republican caucus, signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.[474] The suit was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 11.[475][476] Early in the morning on November 4, with vote counts still going on in many states, Trump claimed he had won: ""This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election, frankly we did win this election.""[478] For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him, Trump refused to formally concede, breaking with the tradition of formal concession started in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President-elect William McKinley.[479] Biden described Trump's refusal as ""an embarrassment"".[480] In the wake of the election, Trump's White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way,[481] and the General Services Administration (GSA) refused to formally acknowledge Biden's victory,[482] Trump finally acknowledged Biden's victory in a tweet on November 15, although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud, stating: ""He won because the Election was Rigged."" Trump then tweeted: ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.""[483][484] In a June 2021 interview with Sean Hannity, Trump stated that ""we didn't win"" and said that he wished President Biden success in international diplomacy, which Forbes declared as Trump ""[coming] as close as he's ever been to conceding his 2020 election loss.""[485] Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November 7, the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Trump appointee Emily W. Murphy, refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president-elect. Without formal GSA ascertainment of the winner, the official transition process was delayed.[486] On November 23, Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the transition. Trump said he had instructed his administration to ""do what needs to be done"" but did not concede, and indicated he would continue his fight to overturn the election results.[487] Both before and after the election, Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican-controlled state legislatures to select presidential electors favoring Trump, even if Biden won the popular vote in those states.[488] In Pennsylvania, a state which Biden won, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider allowing the Republican-controlled state legislature to select electors.[489] Legal experts, including New York University law professor Richard Pildes, have raised numerous legal and political objections to this policy, noting that in various battleground states, Democratic Party members holding statewide office would thwart such efforts,[490] and ultimately Congress would probably reject the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those elected by the voters.[491] Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected, including the power to directly appoint them, Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed, which they have designated to be Election Day, meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date.[492] In modern times, most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state's electors,[490] and changing election rules after an election could also violate the Constitution's Due Process Clause.[493] In November, Trump focused his efforts on trying to delay vote certifications at the county and state level.[494] On December 2, Trump posted a 46-minute video to his social media in which he repeated his baseless claims that the election was ""rigged"" and fraudulent, and he called for either state legislatures or courts to overturn the election and allow him to stay in office.[495] He continued to pressure elected Republicans in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in an unprecedented attempt to overturn his loss. Some commentators have characterized Trump's actions as an attempted coup d'état or self-coup.[47] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who was previously said he would not recognize the election results, publicly accepted Biden's win, saying, ""Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.""[496] A December 18 meeting in the White House discussed Michael Flynn's suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision.[497][498][499] Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying: ""There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.""[500] In a December 20 tweet, Trump dismissed accusations that he wanted to declare martial law as ""fake news"".[501] In a December 21 news conference, outgoing attorney general William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump, including seizing voting machines, appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud, and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden.[502] As the Trump campaign's lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states, including state legislators, attorneys general, and governors who had supported him during and after the elections. He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes, throwing out certain votes, or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature.[503] In late November, he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan, urging them to reverse their vote certifications.[504] He invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House, where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors.[505] He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state, demanding that they reverse their state's election results, and retaliating when they did not, strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets, and demanding that the governor resign.[506] During the first week of December, Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives, urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors; the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state's representatives in Congress to dispute the results.[503] On January 4 The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January 2, Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's result, telling him ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate.[42][507] On January 4, 2021, Democratic congressional leaders, believing Trump ""engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes"", requested the FBI to investigate the incident.[508] In addition, while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump's Georgia call, Democrats began drafting a censure resolution.[509] Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had misquoted Trump, and added a correction to the article.[510] Also on January 2, 2021, Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly 300 state legislators from Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in which he urged them to ""decertify"" the election results in their states.[511] On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 13,558 votes.[512] The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,284 votes. Therefore, the results of the hand recount netted Trump 1,274 votes. The change in the count was due to a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally.[513][514] After certifying the results Republican governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots, despite the fact that this request was impossible,[466] as signatures on mail-in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices, and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.[515][516] The Trump campaign requested a machine recount, which was estimated to cost taxpayers $200,000 in one Georgia county alone.[517] On December 7, Biden was confirmed as the winner of the recount requested by Trump's campaign.[466] On November 18, the Trump campaign wired $3 million to pay for partial recounts in Milwaukee County and Dane County, Wisconsin, where Milwaukee and Madison, the two largest cities in the state and Democratic strongholds, are located.[518][519] During the recount, Milwaukee County election commissioner Tim Posnanski said several Republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents.[520] The recount started November 20 and concluded on November 29, increasing Biden's lead by 87 votes.[521] The presidential electors met in the state capitol of each state and in the District of Columbia on December 14, 2020, and formalized Biden's victory, casting 306 votes for Biden/Harris and 232 votes for Trump/Pence.[522][523] Unlike the 2016 election, there were no faithless electors.[524] In six swing states won by Biden, groups of self-appointed Republican ""alternate electors"" met on the same day to vote for Trump. These alternate slates were not signed by the governors of the states they claim to represent, did not have the backing of any state legislature, and have no legal status.[523][525] Even after the casting of the electoral votes and rejection of his lawsuits seeking to overturn the election by at least 86 judges,[523] Trump refused to concede defeat.[522][523][526] In a speech following the Electoral College vote, Biden praised the resiliency of U.S. democratic institutions and the high election turnout (calling it ""one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we've ever seen in our country"") and called for national unity. Biden also condemned Trump, and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome, for adopting a stance ""so extreme that we've never seen it before – a position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution"" and for exposing state election workers and officials to ""political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence"" that was ""simply unconscionable"".[527][526] The 117th United States Congress first convened on January 3, 2021, and was scheduled to count and certify the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. There were 222 Democrats and 212 Republicans in the House; there were 51 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and two independents in the Senate. Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states,[528][529] meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects, the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote.[530][531] A statement from the vice president's office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to ""raise objections and bring forward evidence"" challenging the election results.[532] On December 28, 2020, Representative Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in Texas challenging the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, claiming Vice President Pence has the power and ability to unilaterally decide which slates of electoral votes get counted.[533][534] The case was dismissed on January 1, 2021, for lack of both standing and jurisdiction.[535][536] The plaintiffs filed an appeal, and the appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the appeals court the next day.[537] As vice president, Pence was due to preside over the January 6, 2021, congressional session to count the electoral votes, which is normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election, demanding both in public and in private that Pence use his position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump and Pence the winners of the election.[538] Pence demurred that the law does not give him that power.[539] Starting in December, Trump called for his supporters to stage a massive protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 to argue against certification of the electoral vote, using tweets such as ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!""[540] D.C. police were concerned, and the National Guard was alerted because several rallies in December had turned violent.[541] On January 6, 2021, shortly after Trump continued to press false claims of election fraud at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, interrupting the Joint session of the United States Congress where the Electoral College ballots were being certified and forcing lawmakers to flee the chamber. As part of an organized effort by Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in close states, the House and the Senate were meeting separately to debate the results of Arizona's election and accepting the electoral college ballots submitted. Several other challenges were also planned. Congress reconvened that same night, after the Capitol was cleared of trespassers, and leaders of both parties, including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Speaker Mitch McConnell urged the legislators to confirm the electors. The Senate resumed its session at around 8:00 p.m. to finish debating the objection to the Arizona and Pennsylvania electors were also considered. The joint session completed its work shortly before 4:00 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[542][543][544][545][546][547][548] The rioters entered the House and Senate chambers and vandalized offices. Five people died as a result: one person was shot by police, one Capitol Police officer died from a stroke after fisticuffs with rioters,[549] one person died of a heart attack, another of a stroke, and the final death is still under investigation. Trump was accused of inciting the violence with his rhetoric,[550] an accusation reinforced with an article of impeachment on January 13 for ""incitement of insurrection"".[551] Several commentators viewed the attack on the Capitol Building as an indicator of political instability that could lead to political violence in future elections, ranging from domestic terrorism to a second American Civil War.[552][553][554][555][556][557] On January 11, 2021, Representative Cori Bush filed a resolution calling for the possible expulsion of more than 100 Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives who voted against certifying results of the presidential election, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the Senate Ethics Committee ""must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.""[558] On March 31, 2021, the Republican caucus of the Arizona State Senate hired several outside firms to examine the results of the presidential and senatorial elections in Maricopa County, where Biden had won by a large margin.[559] There had been three previous audits and recounts of that county's results.[560] The examination was initially funded by $150,000 from the State Senate operating budget; additional funding was to come from outside sources.[561] In July the lead firm conducting the review released a summary of major donors, indicating $5.7 million was raised from five groups associated with individuals who had cast doubt on the presidential election.[562] The audit began on April 22, 2021, and was expected to last 60 days.[563] The investigation was still ongoing in August when a judge issued an order for the release of documents.[564] On September 24, a preliminary release of the audit claimed to have found minor discrepancies in the original, state-certified count, which had actually widened Biden's margin by 360 votes.[565] On May 10, 2021, over 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals published an open letter alleging that there had been ""election irregularities"", suggesting that the election had not been ""fair and honest"" and did not ""accurately reflect the ""will of the people"", and arguing for tighter restrictions on voting.""[566] On May 12, 2021, U.S. Representative Liz Cheney was removed from her party leadership role as Chair of the House Republican Conference, partially for continuing to assert that the election had been fair and that the election results were final.[567][568][569] Well into Biden's presidency, Trump continues to insist that he had actually won the 2020 election.[570] As of August 2021, surveys found that a majority of Republicans believe it.[571] A widespread rumor predicted that Trump would be somehow reinstated to the presidency in August 2021, although the predicted date of August 13 passed without incident.[572] Legend[573] Total television viewers

,,State takes a stand against deep fakes,"Commentary: In the days leading up to the primary election in New Hampshire, several voters received phone calls from a voice that sounded like and claimed to be President Joe Biden encouraging them to stay home on election day.  It was the first well-publicized use of artificial intelligence in a dirty tricks political campaign, but it undoubtedly will not be the last.  The New Mexico Legislature took action this session to get in front of the problem. House Bill 182, which awaits the governor’s signature, amends the Campaign Reporting Act to require a disclaimer for any materially deceptive media created through AI, and makes it illegal to willfully distribute those messages without one.  The penalty is a misdemeanor on the first conviction and a fourth-degree felony on the second conviction. It would apply equally to both traditional print and broadcast media and online sites, which still enjoy special protection from libel laws.  The bill has an emergency clause, which means it will go into effect as soon as it is signed and will be in place for the upcoming election.  New Mexico is joining California, Texas, Minnesota, Washington and Michigan in banning AI from political advertising.  Secretary of State Maggie Toulouise Oliver said she knows of two other incidents before the New Hampshire primary where AI was used in an attempt to influence a political campaign with misinformation. She said she hopes raising awareness of AI will make New Mexico voters more skeptical when assessing all political ads.  The Biden administration has issued an executive order regulating the use of AI within the federal government, but neither Congress nor the Federal Communications Commission have acted to regulate its use in political campaigns.  Every advancement in communications technology provides new opportunities for political campaigns. The government was proactive in regulating messages on radio and television, but has thus far taken a more hands-off approach with this new technology.  AI can be incredibly helpful in helping campaigns identify and target their most likely voters and craft specific messages tailored for their interests. But it also has the potential to take misinformation campaigns to a whole new level.  It was challenging enough for voters to sort through the avalanche of claims, accusations and allegations made each election year when they were all human-generated. But at least with those we could trust our eyes and ears, if not the message.  I wish that more could be done to fact-check political advertising, especially in hotly contested races like the one we will have later this year in the Second Congressional District. The amount of outside money spent on those races allows for more propaganda than any voter should be expected to sort through.  The Attorney General’s Office notes that federal law already allows for disclosure requirements in political ads. That’s probably why the new law doesn’t simply ban the deep fakes.  We can’t stop political campaigns from stretching the truth. But this bill will at least make sure that the falsehoods come from a real person.

,,Nikki Haley hasn’t yet won a GOP contest. But she’s vowing to keep fighting Donald Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — There are no wins on the horizon for Nikki Haley. Those close to the former United Nations ambassador, the last major Republican candidate standing in Donald Trump’s path to the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, are privately bracing for a blowout loss in her home state’s primary election in South Carolina on Saturday. And they cannot name a state where she is likely to beat Trump in the coming weeks. But ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of Saturday’s result. And backed by the strongest fundraising numbers of her political career, she vowed to stay in the fight against Trump at least until after Super Tuesday’s slate of more than a dozen contests on March 5. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In fact, some Republicans are encouraging Haley to stay in the campaign even if she continues to lose — potentially all the way to the Republican National Convention in July. Her continued presence could come in handy in the event that the 77-year-old former president, perhaps the most volatile major party front-runner in U.S. history, becomes a convicted felon or stumbles into another major scandal. As Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement presses for her exit, a defiant Haley will outline her rationale for sticking in the race for the foreseeable future Tuesday afternoon in South Carolina. In an interview ahead of the speech, she highlighted Trump’s legal exposure and criticized MAGA activists who say she’s hurting Trump’s chances against President Joe Biden in the general election by refusing to drop out. “That’s about the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. If I get out of the race today, it will be the longest general election in history,” Haley said. She also pushed back when asked if there is any primary state where she can defeat Trump. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” Haley’s hurdles History would suggest Haley has no chance of stopping Trump. Never before has a Republican lost even the first two primary contests, as Haley has by an average of 21 points, and gone on the win the party’s presidential nomination. Polls suggest she is a major underdog in her home state on Saturday and in the 16 Super Tuesday contests to follow. And since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015, every effort by a Republican to blunt Trump’s rise has failed. Yet she is leaning into the fight. Lest anyone question her commitment, Haley’s campaign is spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan ahead of the state’s Feb. 27 primary, according to spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. At the same time, the AP has obtained Haley’s post-South Carolina travel schedule that features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Indeed, Haley’s expansive base of big- and small-dollar donors is donating at an extraordinary pace despite her underwhelming performance at the polls. That’s a reflection of persistent Republican fears about Trump’s ability to win over independents and moderate voters in the general election and serious concerns about his turbulent leadership should he return to the White House. “I’m going to support her up to the convention,” said Republican donor Eric Levine, who co-hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month. “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” “There’s value in her sticking in and gathering delegates, because if and when he stumbles,” Levine continued, “who knows what happens.” Levine is far from alone. Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, Perez-Cubas said. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever — which includes $2 million in small-dollar donations online in the 48 hours after Trump threatened to “permanently bar” Haley supporters from his MAGA movement. Haley raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. The lone member of Congress who has endorsed Haley, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., insisted that she would stay in the race even if she is blown out in South Carolina, a state where she lives and served two terms as governor. “Obviously, you want to win them all, but for those who say it’s going to embarrass her, or end her political career, I disagree. She’s willing to take that risk,” Norman said in an interview. “I think it’s a courageous thing she’s doing.” Moving forward, Haley’s team is especially focused on several Super Tuesday states with open or semi-open Republican primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate — especially independents and moderates — instead of just hardcore conservatives. Trump not happy Trump, in recent days, has shown flashes of fury in response to Haley’s refusal to cede the nomination. He called her “stupid” and “birdbrain” in a social media post over the weekend and his campaign released a memo ahead of her speech on Tuesday predicting that she would be forced out of the race after losing her home state on Saturday. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” Trump’s campaign chiefs wrote. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Eager to pivot toward a general election matchup against Biden, the Republican former president is taking aggressive steps to assume control of the Republican National Committee, the GOP’s nationwide political machine, which is supposed to stay neutral in presidential primary elections. Last week, Trump announced plans to install his campaign’s senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as RNC’s chief operating officer and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the committee’s co-chair. And there is every expectation that current Chair Ronna McDaniel will step down after Trump wins South Carolina’s primary and party officials will ultimately acquiesce to Trump’s wishes. Privately, Haley’s team concedes there is nothing it can do to stop the Trump takeover. In the interview, Haley warned her party against letting Trump raid the RNC’s coffers to pay for his legal fees while taking a short-term view of Trump’s political prospects. Trump’s standing will fundamentally change if he is a convicted felon before Election Day, Haley said, acknowledging that such an outcome is a very real possibility as Trump navigates 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” As for her path forward, Haley said she’s focused only on her plans through Super Tuesday. As for staying in the race through the July convention, she said she hasn’t thought that far ahead. Some voters wish she would. Gil White, a 75-year-old Republican veteran from James Island, South Carolina, said he was a Trump loyalist until the former president criticized Haley’s husband, a military serviceman, last week. “For him to disparage a military man in deployment is just too much,” White said while attending a Haley rally in Kiawah Island over the weekend. He acknowledged concerns about Haley’s chances against Trump, but said he wants her to stay in the race even if she continues to lose. “I want the choice,” he said. ___ AP writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.

,,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"     Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews with Pennsylvania voters again suggest it's not resonating. Santiago sees the recent 38% rise in use of the organization's food pantry as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Support for WITF is provided by: Become a WITF sponsor today » Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Sometimes, your mornings are just too busy to catch the news beyond a headline or two. Don’t worry. The Morning Agenda has got your back. Each weekday morning, host Tim Lambert will keep you informed, amused, enlightened and up-to-date on what’s happening in central Pennsylvania and the rest of this great commonwealth. Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning.

But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Curt Balsh gets his daughter ready for school in Hellertown, Penn. on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024.

He said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. Christian Miller speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn.

(AP Photo/Chris Szagola) “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn.

Kodak said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem Chapter of the NAACP, talks about the presidential election in Bethlehem, Penn., Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024.

Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, Lee believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said.

Lopez says about voters, “their concern is finding steady work with good pay.” (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,Mad Poll Disease is making Democrats misread voter opinion,"Horserace polling can’t tell us anything new about who will win the electoral college – but the existence of an anti-Maga majority is clear N
ow that Thanksgiving has passed in America, and everyone’s Trumpy uncle is on his way back to his conservative state, we still have our catastrophizing Democratic cousins to contend with. Triggered by the drumbeat of horrific poll results, they are panicking that Joe Biden is too old and unpopular to prevent a second Trump administration from taking power. These cousins, and perhaps you too, are suffering from the latest strain of what I call Mad Poll Disease. It’s a perpetual state of anxiety – spread by the media’s obsession with using polls to forecast the outcome of the next election, instead of empowering voters with all the information they need to decide what they want that outcome to be and act, or vote, accordingly. To cure Mad Poll Disease, start by making this your mantra: Horserace polling can’t tell us anything we don’t already know before election day about who will win the electoral college. We know it will be close. We know it will be decided by six swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Importantly, these states were so close that even the best polls couldn’t call all of them the day before the 2016, 2020 or 2022 elections. In both 2016 and 2020, the margin of victory in most of them was less than one point. If you had clicked on FiveThirtyEight in June 2022, you would have thought Republicans had a 60% chance of controlling the Senate, in September that Democrats had a 70% chance of holding the Senate, and on election day, that Republican had a 60% chance of flipping it again. But in the real world, Democrats increased their Senate majority. Trying to use horserace polls to project the winner in swing states is like trying to predict the weather nine months from now by taking the temperature outside today. Elections come down to turnout, and what that will look like on election day is truly anyone’s guess. Taking the temperature of how voters feel today doesn’t tell us how they’ll feel a year from now – much less whether they will act on those feelings by turning out to vote, or for whom they’ll vote if they do. So why the scary numbers? Pollsters want voters to tell them who they will vote for next November; voters want to tell pollsters how unsatisfied they are now with the direction of the country and their own lives. For most of this century, Americans have said the country was on the wrong track – and they have taken out those broader frustrations on whoever was president at the time. Low presidential approval ratings are now the norm in the United States (for old and young presidents alike), in a stark contrast to the last century. And other world leaders aren’t faring well either. Of the seven countries regularly surveyed by Morning Consult, only the Swiss have positive feelings about their leader and their country’s direction. But when it comes time to cast a ballot, voters understand the stakes. This is where we can really tell those cousins to take heart: ever since Trump’s shocking win in 2016, many Americans who thought elections didn’t matter realized that they very much do. Most Americans reject everything Trump and Maga stand for – taking away our freedoms, filling the government with incompetent lackeys, and ruling with hate and fear. An anti-Maga majority was born, and it has turned out to vote in record numbers again and again. This has been a predictable weather pattern since 2018, but most pollsters and pundits fail to account for it. Remember how 2022 was supposed to be a Red Wave, but it never materialized? Actually, it did – in 35 states. But in the other 15 states, where a prominent Maga candidate was running, we saw numbers more like the 2018 Blue Wave. Where voters understood the anti-Maga stakes, they turned out. This allowed Democrats to keep the Senate. When Democrats lost the House, it was by a much narrower margin than pundits expected. And it could have gone the other way had anti-Maga voters in California, New Jersey and New York understood what similar voters in the states with key Senate races understood – that staying home was voting for Maga to control the chamber. As a practical matter, only Biden can decide not to run, and he shouldn’t base that decision on fear of bad polls. Polls can mislead us into making unforced errors. We hear a lot about how risky it is to run an 81-year-old candidate with bad poll numbers. What about how risky it would be to replace someone who has beaten Trump before, and who has already been defined by both left and right, with someone who hasn’t? It would be an absurd gamble – like doubling down on your bet when you haven’t seen any of your own cards yet. It’s even more absurd to focus on this when we still have a year of news headlines in front of us. As we saw after Roe v Wade was overturned, there is a huge difference between knowing intellectually that something could happen, and actually living in the world where it is happening. It’s not news to most people that Trump will stand trial for multiple criminal indictments next year. But none of us can fully feel the way we will about it once we are reminded every day of Trump’s crimes against the country. To be clear, I’m not saying that Biden is going to win – just that there’s no reason to declare him likely to lose. But media outlets create this narrative out of thin air when they choose to field and devote so many headlines to horserace polls a year out from the election. This saps our agency as voters by creating a false sense of inevitability about the final outcome. And it steals oxygen from coverage of why an election matters – the real stakes to voters’ lives. We know what those stakes are because we have lived through some of them. We know how much worse Trump and Maga are promising to do. Our duty, not as Democratic partisans but as small-d democratic partisans, is to put in the work to make sure every voter understands the choice ahead. Michael Podhorzer, the former longtime political director of the AFL-CIO, is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, the chair of the Analyst Institute, the Research Collaborative and the Defend Democracy Project, and writes the Substack Weekend Reading ",www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/01/polls-joe-biden-election-2024-democrats,
,,Trump vs. Biden: Do American voters want either?,"   Former U.S. President Donald Trump faces four criminal indictments: one in Florida over his handling of classified government documents after he left office, another in Washington for trying to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, another in New York relating to his payment of hush money to a porn actress in the run-up to the 2016 election and an indictment in Georgia for conspiring to overturn the presidential election results in that state. In total, Trump has been indicted for committing 91 felonies. There is no evidence, however, that these indictments are weakening Trump’s support. To the contrary, with the issuance of each indictment his popularity as measured by public opinion polls has gone up. There are several reasons.  One is that hardcore Trump supporters are convinced that the indictments are just further evidence of how far the Democratic Party is prepared to go to use the Justice Department, the FBI and other organs of the “deep state” against Trump. To his supporters the extensive media reporting about Trump’s legal troubles is nothing other than proof of the mainstream media’s hostility toward the former president. With Trump’s die-hard supporters having already discounted evidence of his unethical behavior, it is hard to imagine anything that might be revealed about his actions that would so shock his supporters as to make many of them turn away from him. A lot of Trump supporters who disdain his personal behavior say they will vote for him anyway because they like his ""Make America Great Again"" policies or because they dislike the Democrats’ big government, big-spending ways or because they believe Washington has become a cesspool of corruption that requires radical surgery that only Trump has the courage to perform. Republican office holders are worried that Trump will lose if he runs and that Republican Party candidates for the House and Senate will go down to defeat with him. But they know that if they come out against Trump, the party's base will rise up in anger and use the primaries to deny his critics the GOP’s endorsement. The voting rate among average Americans in primaries is notoriously low. Primaries attract the participation of activists and the great majority of activists in the Republican Party are in the Trump camp. With each passing day it seems increasingly unlikely that Florida Gov. DeSantis or anyone else will pose a threat to Trump’s eventual nomination as the party’s candidate. DeSantis did not get the strong uptick in popular support from his performance at the first Republican debate this month that he needed to give new life to his lackluster campaign. For some on the stage, like the young Vivek Ramaswamy, the debate looked more like an audition to become Trump’s running mate. Short of facing a health crisis — not an insignificant concern for someone who is 77 years old, overweight, eats unhealthy food and doesn’t exercise — Trump is on track to be the GOP candidate in 2024.                  The Bolshevik leader brought strong principles together with concrete analysis, an approach that could guide political leaders in Israel and Ukraine alike.

,,Trump vs. Biden: How COVID-19 Will Affect Voting for President,"JUNE 19, 2020 9 MIN READ Republicans’ and Democrats’ distinct responses to the pandemic could influence in-person and mail-in voting—and who wins BY GLORIA DICKIE Ira L. Black Getty Images (Trump); Mandel Ngan Getty Images (Biden) In late April Democrat Kweisi Mfume of Maryland won a special election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a landslide victory against his Republican rival. More remarkable than his win, which garnered three quarters of the vote, however, was that more than 110,000 Baltimoreans in the district cast their ballot by mail. Only 1,000 voted at one of three polling centers open there. In Georgia’s primaries in early June, more than one million voters used mail-in ballots, a huge increase over previous elections. In Wisconsin, voters are suing for greater access to such ballots because many polling places have closed in response to COVID-19—which has made it much harder to vote in person in the state’s primaries. These are just some of the political battles that have played out during the pandemic, when many people feel it is too risky to gather in public to do things such as vote in person. On June 2 eight states and Washington, D.C., held their primary elections, four of which had been postponed because of the disease. Half of the eight states had turnouts surpassing their 2016 levels—after taking extra efforts to ensure citizens received vote-by-mail ballots. But the others fell short despite such measures. Public health experts predict the coronavirus will still be a threat this fall. Americans can expect that some social distancing recommendations, such as staying six feet away from others and avoiding large gatherings, will remain during the November presidential election, in which Donald Trump will face off against Joe Biden. Political scientists say the ability to vote by mail, as well as attitudes about the danger of voting in person—which vary by party affiliation—could swing the contest. Election officials are implementing several fixes to allow people to vote safely, such as ramping up online registration and expanding mail-in voting. Rollouts of these measures across the U.S. have not been equal, however. And voting processes could differ from state to state come November. Some key swing states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, do not automatically send out vote-by-mail ballots but require people to apply for them. Another 16 states only allow mail-in voting for people with a particular reason, such as a disability. Republicans have long asserted that voting by mail favors Democratic contenders. (Trump has also claimed, falsely, that such voting encourages fraud. Evidence shows it does not.) But Democrats have countered that the opposition comes because mail-in ballots make it easier for minorities, immigrants and young people to vote, and those groups tend not to vote for Republicans. For example, North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature placed limits on early voting after it found that African-Americans were more likely to vote early and to vote for Democrats. Theoretically, states with a robust vote-by-mail system and enthusiasm for ousting Trump could expect to see a blue wave in November, says political scientist Rachel Bitecofer of Christopher Newport University and the Niskanen Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Bitecofer’s predictions for the 2018 midterm elections were largely correct. Other political scientists say that if states do not implement expansive systems for such voting, Democrats—who, according to recent polls, are more fearful of the virus—might stay home. And that scenario would favor Republicans on the ballot. The pandemic will likely dampen large political rallies and conventions this summer, putting candidates in a tough spot: they have to keep Americans safe, but they also need to rally voters and build enthusiasm for their campaign. Trump insists that his rallies and the Republican National Convention will proceed despite the pandemic—and has now moved part of the convention to Florida after opposition to a fully attended event in North Carolina, reportedly without social-distancing measures, came from the latter state’s governor. Biden, however, has largely moved his campaign online and plans for the Democratic National Convention to remain fluid. TIM KEANE JEFF TOLLEFSON & NATURE MAGAZINE LAUREN LEFFER AMY MAXMEN & KFF HEALTH NEWS “I expect both campaigns will structure their campaign events to fit into their overall narrative about how the county should be responding to the COVID-19 crisis,” says Marc Meredith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. “I also expect that the conflict between Trump and North Carolina’s governor over the [Republican convention] is a preview of the conflict that will repeatedly play out between the Trump campaign and state and local governmental officials—especially [in] Democratic states.” But Meredith says that campaigning’s impact on voter turnout is often overstated. A long-standing political science doctrine, called the minimal effects hypothesis, holds that presidential campaigns have a marginal effect on voting decisions. He does worry, however, that the pandemic will limit voter registration. Typically, volunteers with registration forms mill around political rallies, set up tables at college campuses or knock on doors in neighborhoods. Such in-person tactics will be very much reduced. “Door-to-door canvassing is one the most effective ways to mobilize nonvoters to become voters, as it generates social pressure,” Meredith says. A 2000 Yale University study found that personal canvassing substantially increased voter turnout. According to Bitecofer, such voter-registration efforts are key in deciding elections. Her model holds that turnout, not swing voters, ultimately determines who wins and who loses. With this situation in mind, campaigns will likely move to mobilize alternative techniques to target new voters by phone and online. Whichever camp can do so better could shift election results in its favor. Voting for president, unlike campaigning, cannot be done online. Mail-in ballots seem to be the obvious cure for an election plagued by a pandemic. Though studies of past elections indicate that voting by mail did not affect turnout to favor either Democrats or Republicans, 2020 is tilting that notion on its head. Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, says he used to be dubious of the claim that mail-in voting hurts Republicans. But after he conducted a recent survey on electoral processes and the coronavirus—results were released in a preliminary, non-peer-reviewed paper on April 30—Kousser amended his stance. “I think we are seeing evidence of an emerging trend in which a new partisan divide is opening up over voting by mail,” he says. When Kousser asked both Republicans and Democrats about their most preferred method of voting, in absence of any information on the coronavirus, a higher percentage of Democrats said they wanted to vote by mail. When he asked the same question accompanied by scientific projections about the spread of the coronavirus, the partisan gap doubled. “Democrats and independent voters were much more likely to say they wanted to vote by mail after being reminded of COVID-19,” Kousser says. “But the Republicans don’t seem to be influenced by the scientific projections. There is clearly polarization when it comes to whether people believe COVID-19 is a significant risk and want to change their behavior.” He stresses, however, that his survey looked at people’s most preferred voting method and did not suggest that Republicans absolutely would not vote by mail. Rather it showed that if given an array of options, more Democrats than Republicans would choose mail-in voting during the pandemic. Five states—Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Washington and Hawaii—have already established all-mail voting, in which every resident is mailed a ballot automatically. In another 29 states and Washington, D.C., residents must actively request a mail-in ballot from election officials but do not have to give a reason. The six swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all belong to this second group. The rest of the states have rules that only allow such voting if a citizen has a specific excuse, such as age, illness or disability. But several of them say they will allow more mail-in voting this year because of the pandemic.   These policies, particularly in the swing states, means a vote-by-mail partisan divide could significantly influence who becomes president. If less supportive Republicans don’t request a ballot in time or are unable to go to the polls in sufficient numbers, the Democratic candidate could claim victory in November. To underline this point: In one hard-fought primary race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, mail-in ballots favored a liberal candidate over a conservative one and suggested liberal Democrats voted by mail while conservative Republicans voted in person. A New York Times analysis found that the liberal-leaning candidate challenging for the seat generally performed at least 10 percentage points better than the conservative incumbent in such ballots. At one precinct in particular, the conservative justice garnered 64 percent of the Election Day vote, while the challenger took 70 percent of the votes cast by mail. Those mail-in ballots helped to carry the race for the liberal. Voting by mail may be especially important in November if the number of physical polling stations are reduced because of COVID-19. In the Wisconsin primary, only five of Milwaukee's typical 180 polling sites were open. Getting enough poll workers to sites may add to the trouble. More than half of poll workers in the last two general elections were age 61 or older, according to the Pew Research Center. And in the 2018 election 27 percent of such workers were older than 70. This group faces the greatest threat from the coronavirus and has been told all year to stay home to be safer. In both Wisconsin’s and Georgia’s recent primaries, fewer than usual workers showed up. The concern is reasonable: since the primary in Wisconsin, state health officials have identified 71 people who contracted the coronavirus from polling centers. To make mail-in voting work well for the November election, infrastructure will need to be ramped up in the 45 states that have not been automatically mailing ballots, says Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan research group that advises election officials. She adds that such efforts to bolster vote by mail need to start “immediately.” “There are a lot of parallels with the COVID-19 virus in terms of medical equipment,” McReynolds says. “If we’re not prepared, and in many ways the health care system wasn’t adequately prepared, then we’re scrambling to do it at the last minute. States need to evaluate what their needs are now and put those orders out.” States need to order things such as counting equipment (high-speed scanners that can process and count a huge influx of absentee ballots), new printers to produce mail-in ballots en masse and possibly ballot-sorting technology with signature verification, she says. Officials also need to ensure that Native-American voters on tribal lands, who may lack access to reliable mail service, can vote at sanitized, mobile polling units. Without the right equipment and procedures, there is already evidence from the primaries that states will run into trouble in November. In Indiana’s June 2 primary, state officials allowed residents to vote by mail. But some people who requested absentee ballots never received them. Election officials in Washington, D.C., also struggled to fulfill all the requests they received for mail-in ballots, forcing voters to wait in long lines at just 20 in-person polling stations that remained open. And in Pennsylvania, which passed legislation last year to move to a no-reason-needed mail-in approach, the system buckled under increased absentee-voting pressure. Thousands received the wrong ballot. And more than a week later, votes remained uncounted. Senate Democrats requested $2 billion in March for infrastructure to expand online voter registration, early voting and voting by mail. The amount was opposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. And in the end, the Senate passed a bill offering just $400 million for such expansion. A malfunctioning vote-by-mail system during the general election, when turnout will be much greater, could hurt Biden by making in-person voting more important. A preprint paper released in March found that Republicans were less likely to practice social distancing measures than Democrats, perhaps because of the same skepticism about projections of disease spread that Kousser found. “If Democrats are taking more precautions because of the coronavirus, we may see them not turn out as much as they would have without the pandemic,” says Shana Kushner Gadarian, the study’s co-author and a political scientist at Syracuse University. “That is pretty disturbing.” What the virus will actually do to November turnout for each candidate will not be known until after Election Day, of course. The early evidence from primary elections, combined with the results of national surveys, indicates that an expansion of voting by mail will favor Biden. Strong voter registration efforts by the Republican Party could still offset that advantage. And if states are unwilling or unable to bolster mail-in voting infrastructure—particularly in the six battleground states—and enough Biden supporters are too worried about the disease to vote in person while his opponent’s voters feel unhindered, the pandemic could pave the way for Trump’s reelection.

,,Skaggs: I’m voting “uncommitted” on Super Tuesday because Democrats deserve a choice,"        Digital Replica Edition TRENDING: I am a lifelong Democrat and was honored to represent Colorado in the U.S. House for 12 years. Perhaps along the way I have gained some understanding of government and of politics. My ballot in the upcoming Democratic presidential primary is precious. I have cast my vote for “uncommitted.” It is the ballot option that could lead to an open convention, where Democrats can pick a ticket that could more assuredly save the nation from the disaster of a second Trump administration. Other Colorado Democrats (and, with Colorado’s open primary, concerned unaffiliated voters) may wish to express their reluctant misgivings in the same way, as might Washington leaders who have the president’s ear. Let me explain how I have come to this difficult decision. I am deeply grateful for the enormous contributions President Joe Biden has made to restoring the American government. He has accomplished a great deal. The Inflation Reduction Act (and its limits on drug costs), the CHIPS & Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act have worked together with other Biden initiatives to strengthen the economy, bolster manufacturing, boost employment, attack global warming, restore international security and keep America safe. That’s just a partial review of Biden’s record of good government. Political perceptions may be unfair, but they are real, and often have more impact on elections than a reasoned, factual recounting of achievements. We now face one of those “often” times. Serious questions threaten the president’s political standing, voters’ perception of him, and so prospects for his re-election. Inflation is improving but still too high. There’s plenty of blame to go around, starting with the fiscal flagrancy of former President Donald Trump and his GOP Congress in 2017-18. Yet, Biden is saddled with the responsibility and political baggage. He inherited much of the mess at the border, but now has to shoulder most of the blame — even as Trump and the Republicans in Congress walked away from the bipartisan legislation designed to solve the problem, cynically choosing to keep the issue alive for political advantage. If politics and campaigns were rational matters, Biden should be in great shape. But he isn’t. Polls in most of the half-dozen states key to an electoral college majority now have him consistently trailing Trump. The recent release of the report of Special Counsel Robert Hur underscores the problem. The operative part of the report found no reason to charge Biden with any offense for his mishandling of classified documents. The gratuitous part of the report painted an inflammatory picture of Biden’s short-comings as an old man. It played to the narrative that the president is too old for another term. I believe that characterization is as unfair as it is inaccurate. It is hard to admit, but politically, that doesn’t matter. It will haunt the Biden campaign. Meanwhile, we are so inured to Trump’s lies, irresponsibility and criminality that he seems to pay no price. And for me, loving Biden must yield to defeating Trump. If President Biden is the Democratic nominee, I will proudly vote for him. Regretfully, I do not think he should be our nominee. He should face the political realities. He should step aside, as Lyndon Johnson did in March 1968, and open the race to the several worthy Democrats who then would run. In that way, he can preserve the splendid legacy he has earned, and avoid the embarrassment he doesn’t deserve. David Skaggs represented Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District from 1987 to 1999.

,,Biden tells California supporters to stay focused on what’s at stake in reelection battle,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        eNewspaper TRENDING:           President Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he arrives at the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 19, 2024, after returning from Rehoboth Beach, Del. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) LOS ANGELES (AP) — President Joe Biden kicked off a three-day fundraising sprint in California, making the case to supporters to stay focused on what’s at stake in his reelection battle where he will likely again face Donald Trump in November. In remarks at a campaign reception on the grounds of billionaire Haim Saban’s Los Angeles home, Biden told supporters that a Trump win could lead to a nationwide abortion ban, more Republican efforts to undo Obamacare and a deteriorating American reputation on the world stage. Biden also addressed head-on the concerns among his supporters and detractors alike about his age — a lingering issue that’s become a drag on his reelection hopes. “I may not run as fast as I used to. I may not be able to play flanker back at Delaware,” Biden told the audience that included actor Jane Fonda and comedian Greg Proops. “But I tell you what … I’ve been around long enough to know what’s going on.” The president will also make campaign stops in San Francisco and Los Altos Hills this week and will deliver a policy speech near Los Angeles on Wednesday, in an effort to collect as much cash as he can for his reelection bid. Going into the trip, Biden’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee announced that they had collected $42 million in contributions during January from 422,000 donors. Biden ended January with $130 million in cash on hand. Campaign officials said that is the highest total amassed by any Democratic candidate at this point in the cycle. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez called the haul “an indisputable show of strength to start the election year.” “While Team Biden-Harris continues to build on its fundraising machine, Republicans are divided – either spending money fighting Donald Trump, or spending money in support of Donald Trump’s extreme and losing agenda,” she said. The figures suggest Biden is cementing an early cash advantage over Trump. But the numbers still lag what Trump had amassed during a similar period in 2020, when his campaign routinely smashed fundraising records. Raising money is only part of the equation. How well that cash is spent is also a major factor — as Trump well knows. His 2020 campaign effectively lit his massive cash surpluses on fire through a series of questionable spending decisions. This year, Trump retains his impressive ability to hoover up campaign cash, particularly from grassroots donors who typically chip in small amounts online. Trump, who hasn’t released his January fundraising numbers yet, also faces a new threat to his campaign’s finances: the staggering legal bills he racked up while defending himself in four separate criminal cases. In order to maintain an edge in what’s widely expected to be an expensive rematch with Trump, Biden’s campaign will need to accelerate his fundraising. This week’s trip marks Biden’s third visit to California in just over two months for political events. He’s trying to make up for lost time after largely avoiding the Democratic donor stronghold during last year’s strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA. His hosts on Tuesday weren’t in attendance; they both tested positive for COVID-19. Biden wished them a speedy recovery as he spoke to the crowd. “We have to contrast the choice between Trump and me,” he said. “We have to make it crystal clear.” Biden made a quick visit to Los Angeles earlier this month for a meeting with supporters in the city’s upscale Bel Air neighborhood. He and first lady Jill Biden also spent a weekend in December in the Los Angeles area for campaign events. The first lady traveled Tuesday to Guilford, Connecticut, to hold a campaign fundraiser on behalf of her husband. While the Bidens will be pursuing deep-pocketed donors this week, the campaign points to the number of smaller donations it has raised as an encouraging sign for the president. The campaign says 97% of the 3 million donations it has received thus far were under $200 each. Biden has also received pledges from 158,000 “sustaining donors” who have committed to donating monthly. That’s more than double the amount Biden had at this point in the 2020 cycle, when his cash-strapped campaign limped out of Iowa following a fourth-place finish in the state’s February caucuses. The new totals include donations to Biden’s political operation and to a network of joint fundraising arrangements with the national and state Democratic parties. Biden’s 2020 campaign raised over $1 billion, and could need even more in a likely Trump rematch. Biden in recent days has seized on comments by Trump that call into question the U.S. commitment to defend NATO allies from attack as “dangerous” and “un-American.” Trump earlier this month said he once warned that he would allow Russia to do whatever it wants to NATO member nations that are “delinquent” in devoting 2% of their gross domestic product to defense. The Biden campaign launched digital ads last week in three battleground states — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — criticizing Trump for his threat to NATO countries. Biden has also railed against House Republicans for blocking a $95 billion foreign aid bill that includes $60 billion in funding for Ukraine’s war with Russia. ___ Associated Press writers Brian Slodysko and Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.

,,“I Am Done Voting for the Lesser of Two Evils. I Will Not Vote for Joe Biden in 2024.”,"During the 2008 elections, I was in North Carolina canvassing for Barack Obama. I was knocking doors and met a woman who agreed with Obama on all the issues but couldn’t bring herself to vote for him. When I pressed her, she responded: “Well, the thing is, he’s Muslim.”  I took a deep breath and replied that she was mistaken. She kept insisting. After the third time, I finally responded, “No, ma’am, he’s not. I am, but he’s not.” One of the ironies of the liberals’ dream of the post-racial United States in the run-up to that election was that Muslims were never meant to be part of it. The lie that Obama is Muslim was always code for “He’s Black.” But in 2008 liberals couldn’t say that they wouldn’t vote for someone who is Black. Post-racial anti-Blackness had to be more subtle. After seven years of the War on Terror, it was widely accepted that Muslims are subhuman and our lives disposable. So it was easy for people to simply say that they wouldn’t vote for someone who is Muslim.  The HBO political satire Veep captures how insidious and widespread anti-Muslim rhetoric remains. Spoiler alert, but in the show’s penultimate episode, news broke that U.S. President Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) had accidentally bombed a wedding in Pakistan and her popularity soared as a result. One of her advisers tells her, “It turns out Americans don’t give a flying fatwa if you drone a bunch of Muslims!” Another adds, “Your favorables have never been higher, ma’am.” During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama never directly addressed the bigotry behind the allegations that he is Muslim. Obama treated the misinformation campaign as a slanderous lie, further reinforcing the idea that Muslims are unfit for the Oval Office. At a rally in Michigan, members of his campaign even asked Muslim women in hijabs who were sitting behind the podium to move so cameras wouldn’t catch them in the frame. I, like many Muslims, found his campaign’s handling of the issue to be infuriating. And yet, when I was confronted with this woman’s allegation in North Carolina, my initial instinct was to let it go and simply reassure her that Obama is, in fact, a churchgoing Christian. After all, the margins in the polls in North Carolina were razor thin and after George W. Bush’s wars on Muslims, both domestically and internationally, we needed to get a Democrat in there, even if he was tacitly enabling anti-Muslim bigots. I bit my tongue and did my job. Obama went on to further Bush’s wars, bomb more Muslim-majority countries than Bush, and kill countless more Muslims. The horrifying “double-tap” policy for the U.S. drone program was also employed under his watch as he expanded airstrikes in Muslim-majority countries. That approach is when after a drone is ordered to fire, they wait a period of time and fire again — often after first responders have arrived — seeking to kill not just their first target, but also those in the target’s vicinity. I voted for Obama again in 2012. I even went to Nevada and knocked on doors for him, yet again. Lesser of two evils, right? Wrong. I am done voting for the lesser of two evils. I will not vote for Joe Biden in 2024.  The man who offered his “rock solid and unwavering” support to Israel’s genocide of two million Palestinians in Gaza will not get my vote.  The man whose administration circulated memos prohibiting staffers around the world from calling for deescalation or restraint in the face of ethnic cleansing cannot remain president.  The man who is spending billions of our taxpayer dollars to fund an Israeli war machine that considers Palestinians “human animals” and denies drinking water and food to a million Palestinian children belongs at The Hague, not the White House. The man who lied about having seen photographic evidence of atrocities that never took place, and strengthened the rhetoric that is spurring anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian attacks in the United States, is not my candidate. Wadea Al-Fayoume, a six-year-old Palestinian-American child was stabbed 26 times by his landlord in the Chicago suburbs shortly after Biden pronounced his lies. Most Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims I know place the blame for Wadea’s murder largely at Biden’s feet. I do too. If Biden is the Democratic nominee, I will not vote for him. I may, in fact, organize against him if a viable alternative who’s willing to stand up against Islamophobia throws their hat in the ring.  And I’m not alone. A Palestinian friend who works on elections in Midwest swing states tells me: “I’m not going to vote for Biden next year and I don’t know how, after all this, I can bring myself to ask that of others in our community.” Holding back tears, she adds, “We have failed our kids. They have to deal with the same Islamophobia we had to deal with 20 years ago.” Another Palestinian organizer tells me that, every election cycle, she urges Muslims and Arabs to overlook the routine aid that Democrats give to Israel (at least $3.3 billion a year) because there’s too much at stake for our communities to be single-issue voters. But, she adds, this time is different. This isn’t just about the billions in aid. It’s the wholesale killing of more than two million people. You’re allowed to be a single-issue voter if the issue is genocide. Unsurprisingly, a group of organizers have launched a sign-on letter pledging not to vote for Biden if he continues supporting the genocide in Gaza. The pledge reads: “We will not vote for Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential elections if he continues to support Israel’s ethnic cleansing and genocide of the more than 2 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. We cannot vote for the re-election of a U.S. president who enables Israel’s campaign of mass starvation, bombardment, and murder of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.” It goes on to demand that, among other things, Biden call for an immediate cease-fire and pressure the Israeli government to end the occupation and system of apartheid. Though the pledge’s lead signatories represent people of many religious backgrounds, I expect that countless Muslims will add their names. This poses a real challenge for Biden.  Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin all voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and then flipped to Biden in 2020. All four states are home to Muslim and Arab communities large enough to have a determining impact on the election. Biden won these states by turning out disaffected voters who stayed home in 2016. But with Biden’s approval rating in the toilet, he will need every vote he can muster to hold these states. Is he sure he can afford to lose Muslim and Arab votes in those states? Because he will.  “There will be a non-insignificant number of Arabs, Muslims, and young voters who sit out 2024 or vote for Cornel West instead of Joe Biden in states like Michigan and Georgia given his near one-sided support of Netanyahu’s far-right government’s atrocities,” Waleed Shahid, the former spokesperson for the Justice Democrats, posted on X (formerly Twitter).  Democrats have taken Muslims for granted for a long time. Ever since rabid Islamophobia became a core tenet of the Republican Party’s ideology following 9/11, it’s been easy to scare Muslims into voting for Democrats. Until now. Abed A. Ayoub, the Executive Director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, posted on X, “Dear Dems, Do not come into the Arab and Muslim communities with the ‘lesser of two evils’ argument in 2024. Thanks.”  I agree. Lesser of two evils? I don’t know, genocide is pretty evil.  Ayoub also posted: “This onslaught on Gaza teaches us one VITAL lesson as Arabs and Muslims. The whole ‘seat at the table’ strategy is a FAILURE. Being token parts of the Democratic Party, ‘the inside game,’ can’t even deliver a Ceasefire on Gaza. It can’t even slow a Genocide of Palestinians enabled by Biden, Kamala Harris, and the ‘Diversity & Inclusion’ Democrats who throw Arab and Muslims under the same table they strove to sit at.” There are few things as dehumanizing as when a politician you voted for greenlights the genocide and purposeful starvation of children who could be your own. For many, like me, Gaza is the last straw. The name calling and pressure to side with the “lesser of two evils” has already begun. Biden’s former chief of staff, Ron Klain, said on Sunday: “Trump voters going to do Trump” in response to a story about how Muslims and Arab Americans were angry at Biden’s response. I can say this with a hand on my heart: I have and will never vote for Trump, and unless he changes course drastically, I have no intention of voting for Biden ever again. I don’t see how any Muslim or Arab can vote for a man who would rather kill a million Palestinian children than get sideways with pro-Israel lobbying groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). And if Muslims and Arabs stay home on Election Day and Trump wins, Democrats will have only themselves to blame. Biden has made himself toxic to key constituencies that had previously been guaranteed votes for him.  If Democrats are serious about defeating Trump in 2024, they need a new candidate, and fast. That candidate cannot be Vice President Kamala Harris or anyone else who holds a leadership position in this pro-genocide administration. This administration appears to no longer have the support of a large swath of Muslim and Arab Americans. And frankly, I can only assume Biden doesn’t want our votes. After all, he is telling us clearly that he doesn’t think Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims are fully human.  And only humans vote in elections. I hope you found this article important.

On Monday, Biden traveled to South Carolina — the state that rescued his 2020 presidential bid — to argue they should rally to his side again despite misgivings about his handling of the economy, his age and the administration’s halting progress on issues like voting rights, student loans and police reform. Instead, Biden offered a sweeping and at times emotional plea from the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME in Charleston, a historic Black church where a White supremacist gunman killed nine people in 2015. Biden evoked the history of the American Civil War and said that former President Donald Trump and Republicans were seeking to mount a “second lost cause” that would disenfranchise and disadvantage Black Americans.  Biden needs Black communities in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit to turn out in November in order to carry states that will decide the 2024 election. But polls show those same voters have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration on key issues. Trump, the GOP frontrunner, is eager to chip away at Biden’s electoral coalition ahead of their likely rematch. At the church, Biden keyed in on his likely Republican opponent, pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, when Trump supporters sought to invalidate an election in which Black voters helped propel Biden to victory. “In their world, all these Americans, including you, don’t count,” Biden said. “But that’s not the real world. That’s not democracy. That’s not America. In America, we all count.” ‘He’s a Loser’ “Losers are taught to concede when they lose,” Biden said of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “He’s a loser.” Biden’s first two campaign events of the year have taken him to Pennsylvania, the state that delivered him the White House in 2020, and South Carolina, where Black Democratic voters gave him his first primary victory that year. “It’s not possible for a Democrat to be elected president of the United States without winning the African-American vote,” Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told reporters Monday after the speech. “We want to continue to earn their continued support or work to earn their continued support.” Biden has pivoted to directly targeting his Republican challengers in recent weeks. On Friday, he spoke near the historic Revolutionary War site of Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, making a stark case to voters that Trump is a danger to democracy who should not return to office.  Monday’s speech brought him to the home state of another Republican contender, Nikki Haley, who has also struggled on issues of race. Haley was governor of South Carolina during the Charleston shooting and gained national attention by urging lawmakers there to remove a Confederate flag from the state house grounds. Haley, though, drew criticism from figures in both parties last month for initially failing to name slavery as a cause of the American Civil War. Biden referenced the controversy Monday. “They say they embrace what’s known as the lost cause: the self-serving lie that the Civil War is not about slavery, but about states’ rights. They call that the noble cause. That was a lie,” Biden said. “Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: slavery was the cause of the Civil War.” Haley’s campaign responded that Biden had a history of making insensitive comments on race and praising segregationists. Polling Woes Biden’s visit to the state that gave him one of his defining political moments comes at a weak point in his reelection bid, with polls showing him trailing Trump in swing states amid voter unease.  His favorability among Black voters in seven swing states has slipped 7 percentage points since October to 61% in December, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. Trump’s held steady at about 25%. Older Black voters tend to be a reliable group for Democrats but Biden’s troubles lie with younger voters, who question his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and want him to more aggressively champion progressive policies.  A handful of protesters interrupted Biden’s remarks Monday, calling for a cease-fire in the war. “I understand their passion and I am quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce significantly and get out of Gaza,” Biden said.  White House efforts to address some issues important to Black voters, such as gun violence and student-debt relief, have been stymied by congressional Republicans and the Supreme Court. --With assistance from Stephanie Lai and Hadriana Lowenkron.

,,Core voters slipping away pose threat to Biden’s re-election,"Among ethnic minorities and Gen Z, the president’s feel for economics and foreign policy is seen as a liability – and so is his age If Joe Biden wants to hold onto the White House in 2024, Dorien Dudley is the man he has to convince. At 19, Mr Dudley is voting for the first time next year at his home in Baldwin County, Georgia – one of the most reliable bellwether areas in the country. Since 1984, voters there have chosen the successful presidential candidate in all but one election. In 2020, they helped Mr Biden over the line to win Georgia by just 0.2 per cent. As a young black man, Mr Dudley also represents a caucus of ethnic minority and Gen Z voters that helped the 81-year-old president take power three years ago, and which he is now trying to hold onto. So far, it does not seem to be working. “With Joe Biden, I’m not really for or against. I really have indifferent thoughts on it,” says Mr Dudley, after revealing he once considered a career in politics but decided against it after a teacher persuaded him that politicians are all the same. Instead, he is joining the military. “It may seem radical, but I feel like there should be an age limit on people that run for politics,” he adds, noting that Mr Biden’s age and frequent gaffes “most definitely” will inform the way he votes. Mr Dudley’s apathy is reflected nationally in the latest polls, which show that among black voters, young people and in swing states more generally Mr Biden’s campaign is flagging. The president also has the approval of just 39.5 per cent of voters overall – the worst polling position of any president seeking re-election since 1945. Mr Biden and those around him now have one year to turn around those challenging numbers and – in the words of his campaign slogan – “finish the job”. The task falls to a small circle of trusted advisers, ensconced in a high-rise office block in Mr Biden’s home town of Wilmington, Delaware, just 10 minutes from his local church. The mood in the camp is light, despite the results of opinion surveys. “I don’t think polling has been the most effective barometer of how people vote,” one campaign insider told The Telegraph, pointing to a “strong performance” by Democrats in special elections (the congressional equivalent of by-elections) this year. Leading the team since April is Julie Chavez Rodriguez, his campaign manager and the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, a fearsome 1960s agricultural trade unionist who organised a five-year national boycott of grapes. She is described by colleagues as dedicated and, unlike many top aides in US politics, camera-shy. Joining her at the top table is Quentin Fulks, who masterminded the successful re-election campaign of Georgia senator Raphael Warnock, and Michael Tyler, a former national press secretary of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Much of the day-to-day media work is handled by Kevin Munoz, who ran the White House’s Covid-19 communications strategy and featured personally in ads for the vaccination programme on US dating apps, while the finance team is directed by Colleen Coffey and Michael Pratt, two other former DNC staffers. They have had their work cut out. Although Mr Biden has made few campaign-specific appearances, with most of his speeches taking place on government time, the campaign has already spent more money than any other candidate. Federal Election Commission receipts show he has spent $24.8 million (£20.1 million) to Donald Trump’s $23 million. As the campaign picks up in the coming months, more of Mr Biden’s trusted lieutenants are expected to make their way from his White House team to work on his re-election effort. Two of his closest advisers, Anita Dunn and Steve Richetti, remain in their government positions and are thought to be making strategic decisions about the campaign while Ms Chavez Rodriguez runs day-to-day operations in Wilmington. Ms Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr Biden in Washington, is a veteran of six Democratic presidential campaigns, while Mr Richetti chaired the president’s 2020 campaign and now serves as counsellor to the president. On Sept 6, the campaign named Grace Landrieu, the White House’s top economic policy and labour adviser, as Mr Biden’s policy director. Her appointment reflects Mr Biden’s focus as he heads into a year of campaigning. After three years of a presidency marred by high inflation, which has weakened voters’ savings and squeezed household budgets, his aides are in no doubt that a successful economic message is vital to his success. A poll for The Telegraph by Redfield & Wilton Strategies last month found that in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina, the economy was voters’ top priority. A majority in all six states also said their financial situation had worsened in the last year. “Voters do attribute Biden’s policies for playing a role in the rising inflation, for sure,” said Philip Van Scheltinga, who conducted the research. “Even if inflation comes down, voters are still feeling the cost of it having risen in the first place, and that’s difficult to overcome for any candidate. “Even if you have wage growth outpacing inflation, everyone’s savings will have been hit pretty severely.” With inflation now down to 3.7 per cent, Mr Biden is attempting to take control of the economic narrative by talking about his unique blend of eye-watering state subsidies, labour market regulations and investment in technical education. The president has passed legislation that pours $422 billion (£359 billion) into the US green energy and semiconductor manufacturing industries and $1.2 trillion into public infrastructure and argues that the spending will replace “trickle-down” economics by giving America a stronger manufacturing base and reversing the decline of the so-called Rust Belt heartlands in the north-east of the country. The scornful nickname “Bidenomics”, given to the project by the conservative Wall Street Journal, now adorns the stage behind the podium when he gives political speeches and comes with a strapline: “Investing in America.” For his campaign staff, the policy is also a way to win over the support of blue-collar workers in the crucial states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All three supported Biden in 2020 but by a margin of less than three per cent. In almost every economic speech he delivers, Mr Biden talks about “growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up instead of the top down” because “when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well”. While Mr Biden’s focus on the economy may be necessary, it is also a risk. Unlike most other elections in US history, the incumbent president’s most likely challenger has a White House record of his own to sell. At his most recent rallies, Mr Trump has spent a significant portion of his lengthy addresses talking about the economy, falsely claiming to have created millions more jobs during his time in office than Mr Biden. Mr Trump, by far the Republican frontrunner, is also fond of rehearsing his record on foreign diplomacy – not thought of as his strong suit at the time – which he says would have prevented war in Ukraine and Gaza. The latest polls show less than half of Americans now think Washington should send weapons to Ukraine, with the biggest fall among Democrats. The Middle East also presents an electoral challenge for Mr Biden. Although more Americans support Israel than Palestine, the biggest support for Palestinians is found among core Democrat voters. While 59 per cent of Arab-Americans supported Mr Biden in 2020, just 17 per cent say they would now vote for him, creating a headache for his campaign in the swing states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which have large Muslim populations. For the first time since 1997, a majority of Arab-American voters do not identify as Democrats. The polls show young people too are more likely to have qualms about Mr Biden’s interventionist foreign policy instincts. “I think the defence budget increases about 50 billion every time they vote on it,” said Spencer Roberts, a 22-year-old theatre student from Baldwin County who carries a “F--- Trump” badge on his rucksack. “I’m all down for helping out people, but we are not the world police. I feel like there are more important things that can help people here and now that we could be focusing on.” On the age issue, he adds: “I’m not gonna get any social security because there are so many old people. They paid in, so they’re getting it out, but there aren’t enough young people to put that money in.” Concerns about Mr Biden’s age have heightened following a series of public gaffes, including referring to the “nine wonders of the world”, confusing the All Blacks rugby team with the Black and Tan constables that battled with the IRA and referring to Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, as “Mr President”. More than three-quarters of Americans think Mr Biden is too old to run a second time. Privately, aides worry he could trip on stage at a campaign event and bring his presidential bid to an end, through public humiliation or injury. Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a centre-Right think-tank, said Mr Biden is facing a particular challenge appealing to young liberals who see him as an elderly, inactive president who does not have their best interests at heart. “Younger people want action. They want things done more quickly, whether it’s Black Lives Matter or climate change, whatever it happens to be, and so therefore they probably don’t see Biden doing enough,” she said. “If inflation remains high, if Biden stumbles, if things get worse nationally on all fronts, they could stay home, and so the Biden campaign should be very worried about that.” Campaign aides for the president think that while the Middle East crisis is unlikely to be dominating the headlines by next November, the collapse in support from young people poses a significant risk. “We are very cognisant of the need to invest early and build motivation,” said one insider, pointing to an upcoming programme focused on young voters in Madison, Wisconsin – one of the key swing states. Campaign staff talk about working in a “low trust environment” that requires targeted advertising, outreach programmes and local organising to motivate demographics that would otherwise stay at home. In recent weeks the campaign has launched $25 million of television advertisements in battleground states, addressing issues where the campaign may stumble. Top of the list are the economy, the war in Ukraine and ethnic minority voters. An advert that aired on Saturday at a college football game declared that the Biden-Harris campaign was “putting in the work for black America”, highlighting the administration’s policies on funding for black businesses, racial equality and healthcare. “This is the largest investment in black media in campaign history,” one campaign staffer told The Telegraph. A separate campaign push is rolling out on radio stations with a large number of black listeners in the coming weeks, while a second outreach pilot is launching in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. “The campaign is very cognisant of the need not to take black and brown voters for granted,” said an aide. “In past campaigns they have parachuted into these communities at the last minute. That is the opposite of what we are doing here.” Jitters about Mr Biden’s electability among both ethnic minorities and young liberals have already seen him make greater use of what one Gen Z Biden-outrider describes as his “secret weapon”: Kamala Harris. The vice president surprised some analysts by appearing in Mr Biden’s campaign launch video in April after what some saw as a lukewarm first two years in office. Many had expected her to be replaced for Mr Biden’s re-election campaign. But, since last year’s mid-term elections, when the Democrats’ strong performance eliminated her constant requirement to be in the Senate to cast tie-breaking votes, Ms Harris has embarked on a “Fight for Our Freedoms” tour of historically black US college campuses, giving firebrand speeches designed to emphasise her youth and passion. It is hoped that the vice president, who is 22 years younger than Mr Biden and whose parents are African-American and Asian-American, will be more able to convince those communities to stick with the Democrats in 2024 than her boss. In all its literature, the Biden campaign has tried to adopt a positive message to counter the declinism of Mr Trump and a widespread view that democracy in the US is broken. “There are some who say America is failing,” says a narrator in one recent ad, as the screen is filled with a slow-motion clip of Mr Trump. “Not Joe Biden. He believes our best days are ahead because he believes in the American people.” But, with a year until the election and Mr Biden’s campaign off to a faltering start, a key question remains. Do the American people still believe in him? ",www.telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2023/11/04/joe-biden-reelection-voters-approval-poll-one-year-out-2024/,

,,"Nikki Haley vows to stay in race, ramping up attacks on Trump","Watch CBS News Updated on: February 20, 2024 / 7:28 PM EST / CBS News Nikki Haley, the last Republican challenger to Donald Trump, vowed to stay in the race for the GOP nomination Tuesday, saying she feels ""no need to kiss the ring.""  The former ambassador to the United Nations and governor of South Carolina said during a campaign stop in Greenville that she's ""far from"" dropping out of the race, regardless of an expected primary loss in her home state on Saturday. She said she would campaign ""until the last person votes,"" noting that only four states will have held their primary contests by Saturday.  ""Dropping out would be the easy route,"" she said. ""I've been the underdog in every race I've ever run. I've always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, I'm not just fighting someone bigger than me. I'm fighting for something bigger than myself.""  Haley's home turf hasn't translated into an advantage for her in the polls. Nearly two-thirds, 65%, of likely GOP primary voters said in a recent CBS News poll that they'd vote for Trump, with Haley trailing at 30%.  Haley acknowledged the growing calls for her to drop out and her low polling against Trump, but argued that Trump has only secured high-profile endorsements because fellow Republicans fear him. A number of South Carolina Republicans, including Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Nancy Mace, whose careers were once helped by Haley's support, are backing Trump.  ""Many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him,"" she said. ""They know what a disaster he's been and will continue to be for our party. They're just too afraid to say it out loud. Well, I'm not afraid to say the hard truths out loud.""  Haley escalated her attacks on the former president, saying she has ""no fear of Trump's retribution,"" isn't jockeying to be his vice president and that her ""political future is of zero concern.""  ""He's gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than he does on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He's completely distracted, and everything is about him. He's so obsessed with his own demons from the past. He can't focus on delivering a future Americans deserve,"" Haley said.  ""He's taking out his anger on others. He's getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He's trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they'll be barred from MAGA permanently. That's not the way you win elections,"" she added.  Before Haley's speech, Trump's campaign predicted ""the end is near for Nikki Haley"" in a memo sent to the press. The campaign characterized Haley as a ""wailing loser hell-bent on an alternative reality.""  While campaigning in the state earlier this month, Trump attacked Haley by mocking the absence of her husband, who is deployed with the South Carolina Army National Guard in Africa.  Haley became emotional Tuesday while talking about her husband.  ""As I prepare for what lies ahead, Michael is at the forefront of my mind,"" she said, tearing up. ""I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight. But we can't.""  Olivia Rinaldi contributed reporting.

,,How Arab American voters' backlash could imperil Biden's 2024 campaign,"Women pray at Dar Al Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., on Oct. 31. Photo: Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Arab American and Muslim American anger over President Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be endangering his re-election in the majority of 2024 swing states. Driving the news: Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania all have notable pockets of these populations. There aren't reliable statistics on how many are registered voters — but even tiny shifts of support in any of these super-tight states that Biden won in 2020 could make a difference. Why it matters: It's another case of Biden facing possible defections from heavily Democratic groups that in 2020 helped him take down former President Trump, Biden's likely opponent again next year. Zoom in: An Axios review of 2020 results in these crucial states shows that if even a sliver of the Arab American and Muslim American vote were to stay home or defect to Republicans, Biden could be in a deep hole. The intrigue: The Arab American Institute believes those state population figures are low, noting that the U.S. Census doesn't have a category for Arab Americans on its forms. Zoom out: Since Israel responded to Hamas' deadly attack on Oct. 7 with bombings that have killed thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, Arab Americans have criticized Biden for his strong support of Israel. Many say he hasn't shown enough sensitivity to the deaths of innocent Palestinians. What they're saying: ""It has been numbing to us. I feel very depressed,"" Samia Assed, a Palestinian American peace activist in Albuquerque, tells Axios. State of play: The angst comes even after the Biden administration released a plan to combat Islamophobia before Hamas' attack last month, and after Biden appointed several Arab Americans to his staff. Yes, but: Those outreach efforts haven't stopped the public anger from Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, at least for now. Flashback: Arab Americans and Muslim Americans showed their political muscle during Trump's presidency when he instituted the Muslim ban. What's next: It's unclear if the war in the Middle East will be a defining issue in the 2024 election, which is nearly a year away. But many Arab Americans say it will remain fresh on their minds.

Why it matters: Biden administration officials say they want to try and get a deal before the start of Ramadan in less than three weeks in order to ensure there is a temporary ceasefire in place during the Muslim holy month. But major gaps between Israel and Hamas remain.

The voice on the call was a deep fake recording of President Joe Biden. As AI becomes cheaper and stronger, experts say we've entered a dangerous new era for spam calls. After New Hampshire voters received robocalls using a deep faked voice of President Joe Biden telling them to skip the state's upcoming primary election, robocall fraud experts warned Business Insider the incident is ""just the tip of the iceberg"" and expect more to come. NBC News was the first to report the robocalls, which instructed voters to skip out on Tuesday's primary. ""We know the value of voting Democratic on our votes count,"" the deep-faked recording of Biden said in a call. ""It's important that you save your vote for the November election.

Both Foss and Jonathan Nelson, the director of product management at Hiya, a company that provides spam and fraud call protection, explained that they've expected robocalls will play a hand in the 2024 election for quite some time. ""We've known this day was going to come and now it's here,"" Foss said, mentioning he's already seen deep-faked Biden audio in a scam reinventing an age-old one involving a fictitious Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes. ""I would say no question in my mind, this will be the roughest presidential year that we've ever seen as far as robocalls and activity like this,"" Nelson added. This year in particular, Nelson said, will be bad for robocalls not just because it's an election year, but also because the scammers are gaining access to more advanced technology. As AI has become cheaper for consumers to access over the past year, it's only led to the deep fakes getting better and better.

,,Joe Biden says 2024 U.S. election 'all about' whether America's democracy will survive,"U.S. President Joe Biden warned Friday that Donald Trump's efforts to retake the White House in 2024 pose a grave threat to the country, the day before the third anniversary of the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol by then-president Trump's supporters aiming to keep him in power.  Speaking near Valley Forge, Penn., where George Washington and the Continental Army spent a bleak winter nearly 250 years ago, Biden said that Jan. 6, 2021, marked a moment where ""we nearly lost America — lost it all."" He said the presidential race — a likely rematch with Trump, who is the far-and-away Republican front-runner — is ""all about"" whether American democracy will survive. The speech, the president's first political event of the election year, was intended to clarify the expected choice for voters this fall. Biden — who re-entered political life because he said he felt he was best capable of defeating Trump in 2020 — believes focusing on defending democracy to be central for persuading voters to reject Trump once again. ""We all know who Donald Trump is,"" Biden said. ""The question we have to answer is: Who are we?"" Biden laid out Trump's role in the Capitol attack, as a mob of the Republican's supporters overran the building while lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes that certified Democrat Biden's win. More than 100 police officers were bloodied, beaten and attacked by the rioters who overwhelmed authorities to break into the building. ""What's Trump done? He's called these insurrectionists 'patriots,'"" Biden said, ""and he promised to pardon them if he returns to office."" He chastised Trump for ""glorifying"" rather than condemning political violence. At least nine people who were at the Capitol that day died during or after the rioting, including several officers who died by suicide, a woman who was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who authorities said suffered medical emergencies. Biden said that by ""trying to rewrite the facts of Jan. 6, Trump is trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election."" Trump, who faces 91 criminal charges stemming from his efforts to overturn his loss to Biden and three other felony cases, argues that Biden and top Democrats are themselves seeking to undermine democracy by using the legal system to thwart the campaign of his chief rival. The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether Trump could be kept off the ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Speaking in Iowa Friday, Trump repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election and his assertion that the Capitol rioters were patriotic. He called the long prison sentences handed down for some offenders — whom Trump calls ""hostages"" and were convicted of crimes like assaulting police officers on Jan. 6 or seditious conspiracy — ""one of the saddest things."" Biden, in his remarks, seized on Trump's grievances and his pledges to get retribution on his political enemies. ""Donald Trump's campaign is about him,"" Biden said. ""Not America. Not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future."" He added: ""There's no confusion about who Trump is or what he intends to do."" Before his remarks, Biden, joined by his wife Jill, participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Valley Forge National Arch, which honours the troops who camped there from December 1777 to June 1778. He also toured the home that served as Washington's headquarters. Biden invoked Washington's decision to resign his commission as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won — and the painting commemorating that moment that resides in the Capitol Rotunda — to cast Trump as unworthy of Washington's legacy. ""He could have held onto that power as long as he wanted,"" Biden said of Washington. ""But that wasn't the America he and the American troops of Valley Forge had fought for. In America, our leaders don't hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people — willingly."" Audience Relations, CBC

,,Biden has lost Arab American voters. So what's the point of 'uncommitted'? | Opinion,"If you believe that an American president has the blood of children who look like yours on his hands, how could you vote for him? Organized by Arab American political activists, the group Listen to Michigan is asking voters who object to President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war — who view Biden as culpable in the deaths of nearly 30,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry — to choose “uncommitted” on the Feb. 27 Democratic presidential primary ballot. Among Arab American voters I’ve talked to, there’s pain and betrayal, white-hot rage, and a powerful aversion to casting a ballot for Biden, even if that hastens a second Donald Trump presidency, even though no one I talked to believes that would be better for Arab Americans, or for Gaza. And that’s the problem with the vote uncommitted strategy. If it works, it’s a demonstration of electoral power. But what happens next? If you didn’t know voting uncommitted was an option, that’s OK. I’ve covered politics for 20 years and voted in every presidential election since 1996, and I didn’t realize uncommitted was a thing until this month. And yet around 20,000 voters in each party have chosen “uncommitted” in most recent Michigan presidential primaries, in which voters are casting ballots not to elect a candidate, but to apportion delegates. Abbas Alawieh, spokesman for Listen to Michigan, is hoping at least 11,000 additional voters will check the uncommitted box, the margin by which Donald Trump won the state in 2016. Mark Grebner of Practical Political Consulting, the authority on voter data in Michigan, estimates there are roughly 70,000 Arab American voters in Michigan. As of last week, around 400 Arab American voters had requested absentee ballots — a gauge of voter enthusiasm and anticipated turnout — Grebner says. For a presidential primary, it’s normally closer to 1,600. Arab American voters are asking for Republican primary ballots at a higher rate, up by about 7 percentage points.  That’s the other risk, of course — that the strategy won’t pay off at all if the number of voters who choose uncommitted send the message that this is a bloc too small to court. Alawieh says Listen to Michigan is appealing not just to Arab Americans, but the broader antiwar community, with a boost from prominent progressive politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michigan's own U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in the U.S. Congress. “It feels to those of us organizing for a cease fire and ignored by the president, that maybe he hasn’t heard us yet,” Alawieh told me last week. “Maybe by raising our voices with our votes, he’ll hear us.” Then what? In a normal political horse trade, the terms are clear: Do this for me, and I’ll do that for you. And that would seem to be the point of voting uncommitted — to delineate for Biden the number of votes in an important swing state alienated by his Gaza policy. But the second part? That’s not going to happen. A month after Israel began its bombardment of Gaza, pollster James Zogby of the Arab American Institute found that just 17% of Arab Americans planned to vote for Biden this year, down from 59% in 2020. The president’s approval rating among Arab Americans also cratered, dropping from 74% in 2020 to 29% last November. Some activists have taken to calling Biden “Genocide Joe,"" an epithet it seems nearly impossible to walk back. Even Listen to Michigan can’t promise that a shift on Gaza will result in Arab American votes for Biden this November, and Alawieh seems to resent the calculation. “It's odd to be in the middle of a trauma and talking about votes,” Alawieh said. I point out that Listen to Michigan is framing this conversation around an electoral strategy. “We are making our demands clear: Publicly call for an immediate permanent cease fire and implement some level of accountability, stop military funding or make military funding conditional, and then we can talk about the November election,” he says. “But we’re not living in normal times, we’re living in times when a genocide is being perpetuated, so stop the genocide, and then we can talk about November.” I am worried about uncommitted. It slots neatly into the general malaise about a second Biden term, which started when American voters discovered that he’s old, and that when he opens his mouth, it’s a roll of the dice, something we've all known about Joe Biden for oh, say, the last 40 years. Americans have also decided that the economy — at full employment, with inflation on the decline and real wage growth for the first time in decades — is actually terrible. Now there's Gaza. Back in 2016, there were abundant signs that voters were disenchanted with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But the prevailing wisdom was that they'd just get over it. And a lot of them did (Clinton won the popular vote). But she lost the presidency, in part because she didn't win voters in important swing states. Like Michigan. Arab American voters I've talked to say that if Trump wins, that's not on them, it's on Biden. His policies, not Michigan voters, would have enabled a Trump victory. That's semantics. I believe in voting your conscience. And I respect that Listen to Michigan isn't advising voters to stay home. Voting is our right and responsibility as Americans, and to choose not to vote is to disrespect the sacrifices that bought us this privilege. But presidential elections offer binary choices, and a vote not cast is a vote for the other guy, whose second presidency would be unlikely to benefit Americans of any stripe, Gazans or democracy. There's a lot riding on uncommitted. There's a lot riding on this election. For Biden, and for the rest of us. Nancy Kaffer is the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press.

,,2024 will probably be shaped by nonvoters as much as voters,"In the wake of the 2016 election, The Washington Post partnered with George Mason University’s Schar School to gauge how people felt about the results. Unsurprisingly, people who voted for Donald Trump were happy and Hillary Clinton voters were upset. We also heard from people who didn’t vote at all. They were far more likely to say they were upset or felt terrible than that they felt happy. To which the appropriate response was: dude? Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

,,,"Photo by AP Photo/Susan Walsh He would be 82 years old at the start of a second term, the oldest president in history. Democratic voters are not excited by him, polls show, and many Democrat politicians say privately they wish there was an alternative candidate for their party to push in 2024. But on Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced in a video he would indeed seek reelection, and now the only question is who his opponent will be. Will it be a 2020 rematch of 2020 with former President Donald Trump (who would be 78 in 2024)? Will Florida Governor Ron DeSantis run? Will another GOP candidate rise? What Biden makes clear in his video announcement is that he plans to will run on his political accomplishments, his work to lower the temperature of the country after Trump’s presidency, and his determination to, in his words, “finish the job” that he started. “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer,” Biden says in the video. “I know what I want the answer to be. This is not a time to be complacent.” Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, wasted no time in responding to Biden’s news in a statement: “Biden is so out-of-touch that after creating crisis after crisis, he thinks he deserves another four years. If voters let Biden ‘finish the job,’ inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off.” So, what are the issues that will define Biden’s reelection campaign? BU Today reached out to faculty experts across the University and asked them to share their insights. Treat Donald Trump as yesterday’s news. Biden has to stand on his own merits here. He doesn’t even have to mention Donald Trump. He wants Donald Trump because Trump is the proverbial bull in the china shop. Trump’s making reckless charges, acting increasingly irrational at his rallies. He’s becoming more and more extreme, but the American electorate, for the most part, is in the middle. The vast majority of voters are independents and they don’t cotton well to that kind of extremism. It works for the GOP base, which is largely white, evangelical, conservative, and authoritarian, but it won’t work outside of the GOP primaries. The vast bulk of independent voters—especially women—are not going to be willing to go down that kind of road. They’ll look for a more middle-of-the-road candidate which, in this case, will be Joe Biden.  Additionally, demographics show that people under 50 years of age—millennials and Gen Z—are far more policy-driven and they’re less inclined to agree with the extremist baby boom ideology that Trump is espousing. That’s a major problem for the Republican party. And there’s a larger problem for the GOP—the party is not attractive to younger voters. Their base is literally dying and if you don’t replace them with younger voters, you’re setting yourself up for long-term irrelevance, politically speaking.  Biden needs to focus on issues that matter to younger voters: student loan forgiveness, reproductive rights, affordable housing and healthcare, the Green New Deal, and gun control.  On top of everything, it seems like the justice system will do Joe Biden’s job for him regarding Trump, painting him as an unfit candidate for office. We’ve never had a major candidate since Eugene Debs running for office under this cloud of illegality and perhaps even treason. Trump faces federal, state, local, and even civil charges in multiple cases that paint him as a common criminal who considers himself above the law. Unless our society has changed to the point where it no longer matters, we’re not in the habit of electing convicted felons or criminals to the highest office in the land.  If Trump is indicted and convicted for his role in the January 6 insurrection, under the terms of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, he would be barred from holding federal office. All together, this spells doom for Trump’s bid for a second term as president.  Regarding DeSantis, he has already jumped the shark. He’s tried to out-Trump Donald Trump to win the GOP nomination with his increasingly shrill and extremist views and policies: case in point, his war against Mickey Mouse and Disney. It’s become a national joke. It might work in Florida, but it won’t hold sway with independent voters. DeSantis is coming across as a tribute band to Donald Trump, and a rather weak one at that. Biden’s goal here should be to embrace the center and hold onto his liberal base—but his liberal base here really has nowhere to go. Liberals have grown up, thanks to Donald Trump. They may not get exactly what they want from Joe Biden, but they’ve come to recognize they’ll get enough from him.  I respectfully disagree that “Democrats” aren’t thrilled Biden is running again. Are there some Democrats that would have preferred a different candidate? Sure. But the party leadership sees Biden as the party’s best shot to beat Trump in 2024 and Biden’s approval rating among Democrats is 80 percent (according to Gallup)—not a perfect indicator of broader support, but suggestive that he hasn’t been abandoned by copartisans. I don’t know whether Biden has to “energize” the electorate—270 unenthusiastic electoral votes spend the same as 270 excited ones, after all—but he does have to get voters to cast ballots. To that end, he could be well served by the lesson of 2020: when voting is easier, people are more likely to do it.  Voter turnout was higher in 2020 than any presidential election in the past 100 years—a fact partially attributable to the availability of vote by mail. Even though the federal government has very little control over how states run their elections, Biden could directly and indirectly pressure state governments to maintain (or even expand) the availability of mail-in ballots.  There might be something Biden could do to win over Trump supporters, but it shouldn’t be a centerpiece of his campaign strategy. Voting patterns are tightly linked to age, race, and educational attainment, and the national trends on all three of these factors are favorable for Democratic candidates. Even within “swing states” in the Electoral College, demographics are shifting in Democrats’ favor. It would be irrational for Biden to divert attention from mobilizing the faithful to converting his skeptics. His campaign should focus on voter registration and turnout. Given that polling shows economic concerns are top on the minds of voters, the state of the economy heading into the election cycle matters. The ongoing strength of the US economy, including historically low unemployment, respectable GDP growth, and an uptick in consumer spending are positive economic messaging that the Biden administration will stress in their reelection campaign. There are other economic indicators that the Republicans will undoubtedly use to tar the Biden administration as failing the average voter, including stubbornly high inflation, lofty housing costs, and soaring prices of basic goods, including groceries. The Republicans will also try to stress that interest rates are too high and a tax on the average voter. The state of the economy will be front and center for this coming election cycle. Future US economic conditions are a key problem facing President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Swing votes are often swayed by economic issues, which impact voters’ pocketbooks. The misery index, which adds together the unemployment and inflation rate, is a good indicator of whether swing voters will stick with a president or switch. Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.5 percent and the inflation rate is 5 percent.  President Biden’s 8.5 percent index is right in the middle of the range compared to past presidents. This number suggests Biden has a high likelihood of reelection. However, if a recession occurs and unemployment surges or inflation stays stubbornly high, then the Biden campaign might face its own reelection misery. As President Biden announces his intent to run for re-election, a collective groan could be heard from immigration advocates. President Biden’s record so far on immigration has been, in a word, disappointing. It’s not that we never had hope for this Administration’s immigration policy—it’s that we did. Biden’s immigration platform was bold, progressive, and a welcome response to years of President Trump’s relentless attacks on noncitizens, and asylum seekers in particular. But President Biden has seemed a long way from candidate Biden—a then presidential hopeful who spoke with great promise and passion about reestablishing asylum protections, ending unlawful border restrictions and “restor[ing] our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers.”  Yes, this Administration has expanded humanitarian parole for certain groups of Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, but ongoing restrictions at the border and a failure to end Title 42 have meant that the border has been shut to so many more, among them some of the most vulnerable. In addition, this Administration drastically expanded the surveillance of noncitizens through ankle monitors and smartphone applications, and failed to provide long term security for Dreamers, or a pathway for new DACA applicants to receive protection. It is likely with reluctance that immigration advocates will embrace this re-election campaign. Hopefully, rather than hue toward the center politically, President Biden will embrace a compassionate, common sense and lawful approach to immigration policy that deemphasizes enforcement and delivers on his promises from his previous campaign. Biden needs to show how he will make a deal with the powerful oil companies that involves them winding down their activities, and not expanding into plastics.  The curtailment of fossil fuel extraction is the key to a new, unpoisoned world and it’s not an easy one to turn, but it is the one that opens the door to a new future.  Companies that are invested in the old ways of doing business are doubling down now and backing Republicans with all they have, and participating in democracy in an unethical manner, distorting the processes that should reflect the will and the needs of the people.  The will of the people is clear, that we need to act on climate change, and the science, technology and economics are clear that we can have a clean transition.  We won’t have it tomorrow, but today is when we have to get started.  Biden has to start America down that path. I watched the video announcing Biden’s reelection campaign and found a few things noteworthy. First was evoking the specter of the January 6 insurrection. There have been efforts among some to downplay its significance or even deny that it happened. The insurrection was nothing less than a 9/11-level attack on the peaceful transfer of power and should remain seared in public memory. While not explicitly mentioning fascism, Biden frames the election as having higher stakes than simply whether a Republican or Democrat occupies the White House. It is helpful to remind voters that this is not a “politics-as-usual” moment we are living through. It was good to see connections made between things like reproductive rights, book bans, and voter suppression as part of a broader assault on freedom. The overall message echoes rhetoric we have heard from the Biden administration over the past few years on these issues. But people can’t eat rhetoric, and fascism will not be defeated by political messaging.  I am reminded of this observation by Frederick Douglass in 1866: “…no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged class, or denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to maintain them.”  The past few years have been a reminder that freedom is fragile and democracy is vulnerable. This will remain the case without addressing an economic and political system that primarily serves the wealthy, fails to consistently uphold basic human rights, and withholds the means for many to prosper and fully participate in political life. The ongoing Republican attack on Americans is alarming. Republicans have made stripping rights from anyone who is transgender a central part of their party identity. While their efforts are seen as focused on a minority, there is no mistake that they are setting up an infrastructure to eliminate anyone who does not fit their narrow view of who is American. In contrast, the Biden administration has achieved much to safeguard LGBTQ Americans with a particular focus on transgender Americans. Though some would argue these issues “distract” from larger economic concerns facing the nation, attacks on any Americans by Republican-led local and state governments, such as Florida, Missouri, and Nebraska, strike at the very core of our national values. As Biden prepares for the 2024 election, he and his team must not deflect questions about LGBTQ rights and, in fact, should be prepared to lead any debate on these issues. Biden and his team can win more hearts and minds by standing their ground and protecting Americans of all genders and sexual orientations and highlighting how un-American the current Republican Party has become.  I am not worried about Biden’s chronological age. There is increasing evidence that biological age, not chronological age, is what is associated with age-related diseases, including cognitive impairment. Although Biden is 80 years old, his actions and behavior lead me to believe that his biological age is significantly younger than 80.  The cognitive skills relevant to being president are myriad. Executive function—the ability to manage complex data and use it to plan for the future—is particularly important for a president. Episodic memory—the ability to remember events and information—is also important. I’ll also mention that no one person could possibly be able to manage all of the data and remember all of the events and information that a president needs to function effectively; it will also require a team to get the job done.  Thomas Perls, professor of medicine, Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine; director, New England Centenarian Study Joe Biden is only four years older than Donald Trump. According to a medical summary by his physician, his medical issues are: atrial fibrillation, for which he takes a blood thinner, apixaban, which is very effective at preventing strokes; hyperlipidemia, for which he takes Crestor, result[ing] in a normal lipid profile; acid reflux, for which he takes Pepcid; and stiffened gait due to moderate to severe spondylosis and osteoarthritis of his spine. Of note, his blood pressure is normal (128/76) without meds. Many Americans in their 80s and 90s are in very good physical and cognitive health. For that matter, most centenarians who are at least 20 years older than Biden on average experience significant (impacts their function) medical and/or cognitive problems after their mid-90s. I see no indication that Biden is not among the 80 percent of people in their 80s who do not show evidence of dementia. Furthermore, he has none of the risk factors that make cognitive impairment more likely, such as diabetes, obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, or elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol; he’s in excellent health, especially for his age—all of which makes him much less likely to have cognitive issues down the road. I have read that there are some people saying that presidents who are at an older age should undergo detailed neuropsychological testing to determine they are cognitively in good shape. As a geriatrician, we do not perform such tests unless a person is demonstrating increasing and persistent or worsening difficulty with tasks or activities that require concentration or planning. People should not be concerned about losing their keys or forgetting someone’s name; that may happen if we haven’t had a good night’s sleep. It’s when these issues are persistent and worsening that we become concerned. I think misinformation will most certainly be central to the 2024 election in a variety of ways. For starters, it will be very interesting to see who takes over Tucker Carlson’s mantle over at Fox News, and therefore, the mantle of monetizing misinformation and fear under the guise of journalism. I suspect it will get ugly with different Fox News personalities trying to outdo each other to cater to that vast market that made Carlson one of the most successful personalities on cable. Carlson’s own future and what he might bring to different campaigns, either as an official campaign member or as a surrogate, in terms of weaponizing disinformation and outrage, will also play a role, I believe. Misinformation in the MAGAsphere and beyond will remain alive and well and play a role in the outcome of the election—and the Biden campaign needs to be ready with much more effective messaging and counters to it. The Republicans already have a roadmap of successfully deflecting from what should be legislative priorities to using misinformation to create fester[ing] culture wars and creating lightning rods out of what may be considered nonissues, like banning drag shows and books from classrooms. I suspect that deflection will continue throughout the 2024 campaign and the Biden campaign needs to be ready. I don’t know how much the actual outcome of the [Russia-Ukraine] war or any US support for Ukraine—which is not direct support, but in the form of military and civilian aid—will actually affect the election. But I do know it is a major source of disinformation that is targeted to the US electorate. So, I don’t have a prediction for the outcome, but I would warn everyone to be on the watch for misinformation during the election season that will dial up significantly.  The midterms sent a message that voters are motivated when abortion is on the ballot in some way. After so many years of politicians treating abortion as a political hot potato, we see that abortion is politically popular, even in some conservative states, where voters aren’t willing to be as extreme as politicians there may want them to be. Having a Democrat on the ticket is going to invoke messaging about protecting reproductive healthcare at every level of government, and presidential elections historically bring strong voter turnout, so we’ll continue to see this be a major issue, I think. A lot of this is being fought out at the state level, but at the same time, who’s in the White House is highly important. One of the reasons that a federal judge enjoined mifepristone across the entire country is because he was a Trump appointee. Now, Biden has had some success in getting his appointees on federal benches. If you elect a Republican [president], you interrupt that momentum, whereas if Biden is reelected, you have more opportunities to put judges on the courts. This is not to mention what could happen on the Supreme Court—if a justice retires or leaves the bench, whoever is in the White House has control over their replacement. More recently, we’ve seen the [Food and Drug Administration] roll back some of its more restrictive policies about medication abortion, but a new administration could change the head of the agency and push policies through that would reverse that direction, so the [abortion fight at the] national level does matter. Now, people have been urging Biden to do more with abortion—including saying the word “abortion”—but the White House has taken steps to protect reproductive rights. We don’t know yet what’s going to happen in this lawsuit against the FDA. If there’s anything more that the Biden administration can do to fortify the FDA’s support of medication abortion, and fortify access to those drugs, that would be important in the upcoming months. There are some Democratic senators, like Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren [both of Massachusetts], who have urged Biden to do more to strengthen HIPAA, to make clear what kind of resources people have who seek abortions outside their home states—there’s a whole laundry list of things that Democratic lawmakers think Biden could do to strengthen abortion access right now. There’s a mantra that’s important because it’s true: abortion is healthcare. I hope we see this administration embrace that and talk about the bigger picture of reproductive health moving forward.

Once again, we presented a naked king and invited to adore his elegant clothing. This article was truly hilarious. Just read the completely erroneous claims about age not being a issue. Anyone with a measure of integrity or honesty would say that Biden has been deteriorating precipitously. But sure, he will be even better when he’s 82 LOL It’s funny to think that Americans are excited Biden is running for re-election when his health is deteriorating rapidly, our economy is terrible and on the global market the dollar is losing power, we’re losing the respect of other nations, etc etc. But sure a bunch of false promises of gifted money, rights, and a “plan of action” will work. Way to work the narrative that everybody wants democrats in power. Would it hurt the folks interviewed in these sorts of articles to answer questions about the electorate… from the perspective of, y’know, the electorate? Why on Earth would the average voter in Ohio care about Disney’s operations in Florida? And if roughly 50% of voters don’t support medical transitioning for minors or transgender women competing in women’s sports, are the interviewees seriously arguing that 50% of this country are”un-American” “fascists”? The age issue, too, is clear partisanship. Beyond any potential health issues, there is something deeply philosophically wrong about going on record to a college magazine and telling a bunch of 18-22 year olds how they should be okay with an octogenarian president. (And yes, I’d unequivocally say the same thing about Trump.) How healthy can a society be, really, if young people are increasingly underrepresented in government? With falling birth rates, the selfish refusal of seniors (from both parties) to retire from office, the disproportionate impact the recent lockdowns/Covid policies had on young people, the utter lack of sympathy towards issues like rising rent/home prices/layoffs/etc… I suspect that it would be wise for the 40+ crowd to offer an olive branch to us youngins while you still can. Seeing as, well, you guys do need us to like you all enough to pay for your retirements! ;) For most a vote for Biden is viewed as a vote for a President Kamala Harris. She is NOT viewed favorably. Biden never should have announced a re-election campaign. Age is a major issue and Biden looks older everyday.
The Republican have two major issues: 1) they went too far on abortion so there will be backlash from moderate R’s and independents, and 2) Trump’s legal issues will begin to bite which maybe why he is becoming more unhinged.
The American people want other choices. There is a good shot that neither Biden nor Trump get their parties nomination and a dark horse rides to the rescue. My sense is that most people hope so. I know I do. It feels like Biden is in a strange middle ground. Those of the upper class obviously aren’t keen on voting for a democrat (especially the billionaires) since they don’t like getting heavily taxed, but those who are of the low class are also not keen on voting for Biden since the economy is making it hard for people to buy basic necessities. As far as I’m aware the economy isn’t bad at the moment, but it’s being presented as bad to the people who are being affected by it at the lowest level. It’s easy to take common things like high gas prices and expensive eggs and turn them into a weapon against the current leadership.
The environment is something that everyone SHOULD get behind protecting since it literally will affect all of us sooner or later. But those of a higher class seem to not care too much about this issue likely because they are in the group who will be affected ‘later’ by that issue. The climate seems to primarily be an issue that will devastate the lower and middle class since they won’t have the resources to move out of danger areas. The climate could be something that candidates lean into more especially with global warming getting worse by the day.
Even though democrats wish to push forth a lot of programs that could help low income people, it feels like those programs are pushed onto those who don’t even want them. This seems to be especially true for the Midwest. It’s honestly somewhat sad to see democrat candidates struggle in those regions because they seem completely disconnected from the way of life there. They lack the cultural capital that is required to connect with the people of that region, and those people can be painted as ignorant bigots by people who are quick to judge. Having one’s voter base label a certain group of people in a negative way and then giving up on that region will only cause contempt to fester harder and harder. I personally think it would be valuable for Biden to hire people or recruit people from areas like the Midwest during his campaign so that he can gain some of that cultural capital I mentioned earlier. Because at this stage, all of the objectified capital that he could provide through programs or funding wouldn’t get through to a base that understandably doesn’t like him.

,,I Can’t Believe I Have to Vote for Joe Biden,"  Sign up Sign in Member-only story Jessica Valenti Follow GEN 203  election night in 2016, my six-year-old daughter and I wore matching “feminist” T-shirts, ordered a pizza, and sat glued in front of the television with my mother. Assuming three generations of women were about to watch the first female president be elected, I bought a bottle of champagne. (It’s still sitting in a dusty corner of my bar.) This November, there won’t be buzzy excitement or matching T-shirts with my daughter. On election day, my choice will be between Donald Trump, a dangerous bigot who has been credibly accused of rape, sexual assault, and harassment by more than two dozen women over a more than four-decade period, and Joe Biden, a man recently accused of sexually assaulting a Senate aide in the 1990s, and who has made fun of the women who complained about his penchant for unwanted shoulder rubs. Biden is the better choice by a mile, and I’ll do what’s right for the country and vote for him. But I’m still furious: I can’t believe that when faced with the most dangerous president of our lifetime, Democrats are moving ahead with a nearly 80-year-old moderate who has shown himself time and again not up for the fight. I am livid that Democratic women will be called on, once again, to cast our vote in the name of reducing harm to the country rather than moving it forward. Most of all, I’m angry that people who want Trump out are expected to just vote without airing our concerns about the man who stands between him and another four years. I understand the deep worry so many Democrats share about fighting Trump with anything less than full-throated enthusiasm for our candidate. The consequences of losing another election — more far-right Supreme Court justices appointed, more children separated from their parents at the border, more hate crimes, and more lives and jobs lost amid this mismanaged pandemic — are real and terrifying. But the idea that we can no longer speak the truth aloud for fear of losing is a dangerous one. And the truth is that this election is going to be terrible for women, no matter what we do.

,,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"WesternSlopeNow.com   by: GARY FIELDS, Associated Press Posted: Feb 17, 2024 / 10:11 AM MST Updated: Feb 17, 2024 / 10:16 AM MST    BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,CMV: Joe Biden has an extremely strong chance for reelection," I believe that Joe Biden will most likely win reelection by a large or larger margin than in 2020. My reasoning? Well the economy, despite inflation, has seen an improvement since 2022 and now appears to be getting better (as far as I know and have researched). Trump has now faced multiple indictments and his ties to the January 6th insurrection and support for conspiracy theories surrounding the 2020 election and his liability in a sexual assault case is enough to turn off quite a large portion of independent and undecided voters. Plus with things seemingly getting worse for Trump by the day I would honestly not be surprised if he dropped out sometime early next year. The other republican candidates also don't have much traction and would likely be weak candidates against Biden in a general election. Ron DeSantis goes far too much into the ""woke"" crap and his anti-LGBT record will definitely make LGBT voters turn out in droves for Biden, Vivek Ramaswamy only gains traction with the far right and a majority of voters have never even heard of him, Mike Pence would dissapoint MAGA republicans due to him not supporting Trump, Chris Christie would also dissapoint MAGA and those voters would likely stay home. So overall, if Biden and Trump have a rematch in 2024, I believe Joe Biden would win by a large margin, Trump is simply too controversial of a person and his rhetoric and indictments will make him lose support among many voters. I don't know. I really hope we don't get another Trump for 4 years. I believe for a democratic candidate to win, they need to get voters that don't normally vote out especially the younger generations. Talking to my Zoomer friends, they had a list of things they were excited to vote for (some universal higher education, public option, etc). My Zoomer friends aren't excited for Biden at all now. I don't know if Biden will excite the base enough to win again. Trump does rile up his base quite a bit. We will see though. I think it could go either way. Well, it would be unjustifiable to say that he had a as high as 70% chance of winning. I’m assuming your definition of “extremely strong” lies somewhere between 50-70%? I don’t think that you can call that an “extremely strong chance”. Large margin in what aspect? Joe Biden beat trump by 4.5pp in the popular vote, which seems like a decent margin on paper. But in practice, Biden barely beat Trump by 40k votes in three key electoral college states. Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Three states that could easily flip back in 2024. Could you provide an example of a recent presidential election, say, after Nixon in 72 where both candidates didn't have a reasonable chance at victory? Obama-Mccain was pretty one sided. I don't think anyone expected Obama to lose. I have the opposite view. Biden would be 82 years old entering a new term, 86 years old at the end of the term. I think more and more Americans, even if they don't admit it publicly, don't feel that Biden has the strength and stamina to give the country what it needs to overcome a lot of the escalating issues. Dems are making a huge mistake by assuming voters will happily elect a lame duck president just because they are on the ballot and not Trump. And I think many conservatives, even if they don't publicly support Trump, feel the cultural pendulum has swung far enough to the left and will vote for anyone on the ballot to bring it back the other way. Maybe this will age poorly but I have strong conviction that Trump will win comfortably based on Biden's approval ratings, polling, and general sentiment I'm observing across different social networks across the political spectrum. Because I agree that Trump will likely lose and any other Republicans have even less chance, and no Dems will challenge, I'll argue that the 80 year old Biden has a strong chance to keel over and die before the election. Your emperor has no clothes, the guy can't speak for more than 5 minutes, gets lost on stage, staffers lead him by the hand ,and have the answers ready for him in advance because they give him a list of journalists he is allowed to ask questions from. Constantly stumbling, mumbling, bumbling is there for all to see. Joe Biden is a serious laughing stock on world stage. You would know this if you circumvent our propaganda press that shields Biden from all his gaffes, and watch news from the enemy territory where Joe Biden is on every foreign comedy show, displayed in his full nakedness. That is why our enemies are not afraid of America. The leader of the free world is weak. He is a representation of a decaying America. The question to you is, do you even see cognitive disability of our leader? It is transparent and on full display if you look with your own two eyes. On the other hand we have, Trump, the most indicted man in America and growing in popularity with every indictment, because the imbeciles are making a martyr out of him. What percentage number would you give to an ""extremely strong chance""? I don't think it would be that clear cut. Trump could very well emerge victorious. The people who supported him before support him now with the added perception that the Left is turning him unto a martyr. I predict even more Trump supporters will turn up to the polls. Not only that, Biden's support among Democrats is wavering. I doubt they would vote Trump, but they will probably stay home. The following shows Trump and Biden in pretty much a dead heat: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/ Biden certainly has a chance of reelection, but I would say it is an average chance. Not a strong one.         ",www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/175se50/cmv_joe_biden_has_an_extremely_strong_chance_for/,
,,Young Voters Were Crucial to Biden’s Win,"Voters ages 18-29, especially young voters of color, propelled Biden to victory in several battleground states, election data shows President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has plenty of people to thank for his election win over incumbent President Donald Trump. But voting data shows he should be especially grateful for the support of young voters—in particular, young voters of color. Nationwide, 61 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for Biden, while 36 percent voted for Trump, according to analysis from the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), the non-partisan research center on youth engagement at Tufts University’s Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life. That’s higher than the level of youth support Hillary Clinton received from young voters in 2016. About half of eligible 18- to 29-year-olds voted, and CIRCLE projects that could rise to 56 percent when all votes are counted. Across the country, young voters of color overwhelmingly cast ballots for Biden, including 87 percent of young Black voters, 83 percent of young Asian voters, and 73 percent of young Latino voters. The white youth vote also favored Biden, but much more narrowly, at 51 percent. “During this election cycle, as young people are raising their voices, advocating for change, and voting in historic numbers, CIRCLE’s research has provided the essential data and analyses that help us all see and understand the importance of young people to our nation’s civic life and their impact on the future of our democracy,” said Alan D. Solomont, A70, A08P, the Pierre and Pamela Omidyar Dean of Tisch College of Civic Life. In four key states—Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—youth voters favored Biden over Trump by a margin of more than 100,000 votes in each of those battleground states. A deeper dive into CIRCLE’s data reveals more striking points. In Georgia, about 57 percent of young voters favored Biden over Trump, giving the Democratic candidate a razor-thin lead over Trump in the traditionally red state. Among young voters of color in Georgia, Biden’s lead was much wider: 90 percent of young Black voters chose Biden. Of Michigan voters ages 18 to 29, 62 percent chose Biden and 35 percent went for Trump, giving Biden an edge of about 194,000 youth votes—higher than the 148,000-vote margin of victory in the state. About 77 percent of Michigan’s young voters of color cast ballots for Biden. “Young people’s activism, participation, and leadership in this election have been historic, with young people of color playing an especially critical role,” said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, Director of Tisch College’s CIRCLE. “Our data reveal that youth cast more than 10 million early and absentee ballots, and possibly upwards of 25 million ballots in total, turning out at a higher rate than in recent elections.” Many young voters cited the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for their decision. A CIRCLE analysis found that more than half (52 percent) of 18- to 29-year-olds said they or someone in their home lost a job or had reduced pay due to COVID-19. Those voters favored Biden by a 33-point margin. About one out of five young people said they’ve lost a friend or family member to the virus, and that number is higher among youth of color, whose communities have suffered more case numbers and deaths from COVID-19 than white communities. Support for Biden was even higher among young voters who know someone who died of COVID-19.  “Even at this time of so much uncertainty, when the nation is confronting a pandemic, widespread economic hardship, and systemic racism, young people voted in large numbers across the country—and powered the Biden-Harris ticket to victory,” said Kawashima-Ginsberg. While many young voters made sure to cast their ballot, not all of them expressed confidence that it would be counted properly. A CIRCLE analysis of election data found that a majority of young voters had at least some doubts about the electoral process: 73 percent of young white voters and 68 percent of young voters of color were either “not too confident” or “somewhat confident” that votes would be counted accurately. Voters ages 18-29 also worried about interference from other countries in this election, CIRCLE’s analysis showed. About 44 percent of youth voters of color said they were “very concerned” that this interference would affect the presidential election results. However, young voters were more optimistic about other parts of the electoral process. More than three out of four young people said they were somewhat or very confident that eligible voters would be allowed to cast a ballot, and those voters were similarly confident that voter fraud would not be an issue. In the coming weeks and months, CIRCLE will continue to provide in-depth analysis of youth engagement in the 2020 election and beyond.

,,"Biden battles Trump, lack of enthusiasm among Black voters","It is unclear if Black Americans will be energised to come to vote, potentially defining the outcome of the election. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Racial inequality in the United States came into sharp focus this year, and became a defining topic of the national debate, after police killings of Black Americans ignited months of widespread protests and galvanised the nation to demand racial justice and police reforms. The unrest has forced US President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election on a “law and order” platform, and his main challenger, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, to wrestle with the complicated issue of race in America, and try to appeal to Black voters. But with less than two months before the election, in the middle of a pandemic and record-high unemployment rates, whether Black Americans will be energised to come out in large numbers to vote remains uncertain – potentially defining the outcome of the 2020 election. A recent poll shows Biden by far outperforming Trump among Black voters, with 78 percent support. “Most Black voters are going to support Joe Biden,” said Ravi Perry, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science at Howard University, a historically Black university. “But there are differences in enthusiasm,” Perry tells Al Jazeera, “where Black women, for instance, have far more enthusiasm towards Biden, and many young people, support him but with far less enthusiasm.” Earlier this month, both candidates visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, a battleground state, and the site of the most recent turmoil following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who remains hospitalised after being shot in the back seven times by a white police officer while authorities were trying to arrest him in late August. Speaking at a local church in Kenosha after a private meeting with Blake and his family, Biden said the latest events would help Americans confront centuries of systemic racism. In contrast, Trump did not mention Blake by name, refused to acknowledge systemic racism and instead blasted the protesters and offered his unequivocal support to law enforcement. Data shows that Black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic Party since at least the 1960s, when the party passed civil rights legislation that outlawed racial segregation and prohibited racial discrimination in voting. But Black turnout, which rose in the 2008 and 2012 elections when the US elected and then re-elected the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, waned in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee. More profoundly, there is a growing level of cynicism among Black voters, pollsters have argued, particularly among young and male voters, and point to 2016 – when Clinton lost to Trump amid a six percentage points decline among Black voters – which proved critical in battleground states. Trump’s campaign this year has been trying to appeal to Black voters, particularly Black male voters and improve on his 2016 results, when 8 percent of Black people voted for him. According to a recent poll, 13 percent of Black voters said they plan to vote for Trump this election. Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury said, according to recent data he compiled, about half of Black voters believe the Democratic Party takes Black voters for granted and may choose to stay home or vote for Trump. “What we saw at the Republican National Convention was a very overt attempt to speak directly to the issues that are most important to Black men: criminal justice reform and unemployment,” Woodbury said. On the first night of the convention in August, the only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, relayed his personal success story, “Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,” he said. And Trump gave a full pardon to Jon Ponder, a Black convicted felon turned criminal justice activist. Several other Black speakers took the stage during the four-day event, including NFL players and a civil rights activist, and some touted Biden’s gaffe when he said that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” “The course of this election year will show that Black men are not a marginal part of his (Trump’s) strategy, but a path to victory,” Woodbury told Al Jazeera, “and he’s leaning into it.” And yet for many, voting Trump out of office, is a motivation on its own. Trump promoted the “birther movement”, alleging that Obama was not born in the US. He refused to condemn white supremacists and more recently, he allegedly called Black people “too stupid” to vote for him, according to his estranged former lawyer Michael Cohen. James Lance Taylor, a professor at the University of San Francisco, said many Black people will vote for Biden for no other reason than “to deal with the emergency of removing Donald Trump from office”. Many of the demonstrators who took to the streets after the police killing of George Floyd in May were making calls to “defund the police,” which would divert funds away from police departments and prisons in favour of investments in social services and re-examine what offences require a militarised response. Biden has said, “I don’t support defunding the police.” Instead, he has proposed a $300m investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities. According to a Gallup survey taken in July, 70 percent of Black Americans support or strongly support reducing police department budgets. But despite its popularity among Black Americans, strategists said if Biden backed the idea, he would run the risk of losing the support of moderate older white voters, a key demographic. “Defund the police may sound pretty good on Twitter, but to an awful lot of voters, including African Americans, it doesn’t make much sense,” Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist told Al Jazeera. “They want better policing, they want smarter policing, they don’t want the police defunded,” Manley said. Instead of embracing “defund the police,” Biden, who served as Obama’s Vice President for eight years, nodded to Black voters by choosing Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman to be nominated on a major party’s ticket. “Black folks noticed and were excited by it,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. “There is a segment of our community that thinks Kamala Harris’ record as district attorney and attorney general is shaky,” he said in reference to her years as a prosecutor when she embraced a “top cop” label. “But the overall feeling is definitely that is a step in the right direction, a sense that he recognises us.” The coronavirus pandemic, a disease which has killed more than 192,000 Americans and disproportionately affected Black communities, has added an additional layer of uncertainty regarding how many and who will be able to cast their vote in November. Most states said they will expand their mail-in voting systems amid health concerns about crowds and long lines. It remains unclear how turnout will be affected. But for most, Albright says, the desire to see Trump out of office, casts an urgency on the importance of voting this year that will outweigh all other considerations. “Even among people who are not enthusiastic about Biden, people are more clear, now we know better,” he said, “We see what a Trump presidency looks like and how it is impacting our lives and our health.” Follow Al Jazeera English: ",www.aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/12/biden-battles-trump-lack-of-enthusiasm-among-black-voters,
,,The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election,"An official website of the United States government       What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most consequential global events since World War II, affecting virtually every country in the world. By the end of November 2020, more than 60 million people had contracted the virus and over one and a half million had died. In response to the pandemic, governments restricted citizens’ movement to varying degrees through lockdown measures, with the objective of slowing the spread of the disease. The pandemic contributed to severe economic contractions in most countries, increasing unemployment and poverty around the world.1 In the USA, the COVID-19 pandemic struck during a presidential election year, shifting the political narrative and Trump’s re-election prospects. Prior to the pandemic, the US economy was performing well, and Trump, while extremely polarizing, enjoyed strong support among Republican voters.2 The virus changed the narrative and shaped the political campaign. As of the end of November 2020, the USA had suffered the largest numbers of cases (over 8 million) and deaths (over 220,000) in the world. Trump’s pandemic response, which contrasted with those of many leaders in other Western democracies, was repeatedly criticized by epidemiologists and scientists. In this paper, we explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election. We investigate whether Trump’s electoral support fell in localities hit harder by the pandemic. Guided by a pre-analysis plan (PAP), which reduces concerns about data mining, we constructed a data set at the county-level, with the difference in vote share for Trump between the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections as our dependent variable.3 Our main independent variable is COVID-19 cases, which we gather from the data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In our estimates, we control for social distancing and four occupational measures: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. In addition, we account for demographic and socioeconomic variables and for changes in unemployment between August 2019 and August 2020. In placebo tests, we show that COVID-19 incidence is uncorrelated with changes in Republican candidates vote share in previous elections, e.g., votes for Trump in 2016 compared with votes for Romney in 2012. In an attempt to sharpen our identification strategy, we instrument COVID-19 cases with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. We show that counties with a larger share of workers employed in meat-processing factories experienced a significantly larger number of cases than counties with a smaller share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. Our two-stage least squares estimates also control for the share of manufacturing workers and the share of food manufacturing workers in each county as well as for counties’ vulnerability to Trump’s trade policies in an effort to validate the exclusion restriction. Our results indicate that COVID-19 cases had a significant negative effect on the Trump vote share in the 2020 presidential election (in comparison to 2016). This finding holds in both the reduced form analysis and the instrumental variable analysis. We also find potentially important heterogeneity in the effect of COVID-19. In particular, the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a formal stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that the change in the unemployment rate is related to electoral support for Trump. There is some evidence that COVID-19 cases affect voters’ mobilization, measured as the number of votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016. These effects not only are significant and robust to many robustness checks but they are also quite sizable. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if the number of COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin—likely resulting in his re-election. Our paper is related to several streams of the literature on political behavior and political economy.4 First, our paper speaks to the literature on retrospective voting, which examines how citizens evaluate and vote based on their perceptions of the incumbent’s performance (Fiorina 1981; Ferejohn 1986; Persson et al. 1997; Fearon 1999; Canes-Wrone et al. 2001; Ashworth 2012). Our findings indicate that voters assess the competence of political leaders in the case of a pandemic and hold them accountable for rising numbers of cases and deaths. This is consistent with evidence in Herrera et al. (2020), who find in a sample of 35 countries that approval of incumbent politicians falls as COVID-19 cases grow, as well as Gutierrez et al. (2020), who find that voters punished the incumbent government following the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico. Second, our paper is related to a literature that links shocks such as natural disasters to political behavior (Abney and Hill 1966; Chen 2012; Malhotra and Kuo 2008; Bechtel and Hainmueller 2011). The logic of this literature is similar to that of retrospective voting. Rational voters reward incumbents not only for delivering a positive economic performance in good times but also for organizing prompt rescue and relief programs in bad times, such as in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Our findings indicate that incumbent governments are punished electorally for failing to provide effective mitigation and relief, even if the primary shock (in this case, a virus) is not directly attributable to them. Third, our paper speaks to the literature on the effect of personally experiencing shocks (e.g., crises and wars) on political and social attitudes (Lau et al. 1978; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981; Erikson and Stoker 2001; Mo and Conn 2018). Our findings are consistent with studies showing that negative economic shocks increase support for government intervention in the economy and redistributive policies as well as people’s beliefs about the relative importance of luck versus effort (Margalit 2013; Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014). These changes in voters’ preferences and beliefs are consistent with increasing support for a Democratic candidate over an incumbent Republican president in the midst of a pandemic. Finally, our paper also relates to a growing literature on the pandemic. For instance, Allcott et al. (2020) rely on smartphone data and provide evidence that areas with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing. Baccini and Brodeur (2020) show that Democratic governors and governors without a term limit are significantly faster (and more likely) to adopt stay-at-home orders than Republican governors and governors with a term limit. Warshaw et al. (2020) demonstrate that states and local areas with relatively more COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support Republican House and Senate candidates. Other papers have explored related issues, such as policy responses and social distancing, in other countries such China and Italy (Qiu et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021; Milani 2021). News of a novel coronavirus made global headlines beginning in January 2020. On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a coronavirus-type pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began screening at three major US airports on January 20, and the first US coronavirus case was confirmed the following day. On January 23, China made the unprecedented move of quarantining Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The white House announced on January 31 a travel ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to China within the past 14 days. The first US death from the disease occurred on February 29 in Washington State.5 The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. That same day the US National Basketball Association suspended all games, and the actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for the virus in Australia. Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, unlocking up to $50 billion dollars in federal funding to combat the spread of the disease, the same day on which several states announced school closures. On March 19, California became the first state to issue a “stay-at-home” order, with exceptions for work and shopping for essential needs. On March 26, Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which provided $2 trillion in aid to businesses, hospitals, and local governments. While no country was unaffected, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the USA particularly hard. The US COVID-19 death toll passed the grim mark of 100,000 on May 28; by September 22, 200,000 American lives had been lost. Measured on a per capita basis, only Brazil, Spain, and Mexico have recorded higher death rates among large countries.6 Along with lost lives, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the USA exerted a profound economic impact. Increasing numbers of cases caused changes in consumer behavior, with large drops in consumption of services (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020) leading to an unprecedented increase in unemployment (Chetty et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020). The economic downturn coincided with changing political attitudes about the role of government, with Rees-Jones et al. (2020a) finding deaths and infections associated with increased support for expanding the US safety net. In sharp contrast to most world leaders and to his opponent Joe Biden, Trump sought to downplay the threat of the virus, with limited political success. He began this tactic early in the crisis, and never veered from it. On February 10, Trump claimed, “a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat...” On February 26, as US cases began to appear, he said, “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Again, on April 3, he remarked, “It is going to go away. It is going away.” He continued making similar comments throughout the summer, and in his first remarks after contracting the virus himself in October, he declared, “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”7 The tactic did little to help his standing with the electorate. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating fell from a 2020 high of 49% on March 22 to 38% on June 30.8 Polls showed nearly 60% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s response to the pandemic, with very little variation in the 5 months leading up to the election.9 There are several reasons to believe that the pandemic and the Trump administration’s response were detrimental to Trump’s reelection prospects. The strong disapproval of the president’s handling of the virus suggests that a majority of the public blamed the administration for its failure to curtail its spread. Most importantly, voters likely associate rising local cases and deaths with an increasing threat to the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. In this context, we might expect that the greater the local exposure to risk, the more likely voters are to punish the president by voting for the challenger. Another channel through which COVID-19 may have lead to diminished Trump support is economic. Despite a big rebound in economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate remains well above the historical average. Ominously, rising case numbers in the lead-up to the election portended another wave of hospitalizations and deaths—and the prospect of more localized lockdowns, business closures, and a double-dip recession. Both retrospective and prospective voting frameworks suggest that voters are likely to hold the president accountable for the toll of the virus. For these reasons, we examine whether more severe local outbreaks are associated with weaker support for Trump in 2020, compared to the 2016 presidential election. There is, however, a counter-argument to be made. A possible interpretation of Trump’s strategy in responding to the pandemic is that it was in line with the preferences of his core constituents. Survey data reveal a striking difference in attitudes toward the pandemic between Democratic and Republican voters. According to Gallup, only 25% of Republican respondents are “worried about getting the coronavirus,” whereas this percentage climbs to almost 80% among Democratic respondents.10 Similarly, about 60% of Republican respondents are “ready to return to normal activities right now,” whereas a mere 3% of Democratic respondents are ready to resume a normal lifestyle. We see similar differences for questions related to practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. While ideology influences attitudes toward the pandemic in other countries as well, the differences between Democratic and Republican voters in the USA are uniquely large. In short, given the polarization of US politics, voters seem to be experiencing the very same event in very different ways based on their partisan identities. If this is the case, even a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths may not meaningfully reduce support for Trump, especially among his base. We describe all the data that we use in our analysis below. Our analysis relies on known COVID-19 cases and deaths, recorded at the county-level. We use the COVID-19 incidence data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The data and data sources at the state and county levels can be accessed here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths correspond to October 22, 2020. In our sample, the mean for the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 is 247 (std. dev. 157), while the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 is 53 (std. dev. 56). Figure 1 and Appendix Fig. 4 illustrate the distribution of cases and deaths in the USA, respectively. Cumulative Number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 as of October 22, 2020 Cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 as of October 22, 2020 We also gather data on the following COVID-19 policies: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for individuals arriving from another state. Data on policy duration are drawn from Raifman et al. (2020). See our discussion paper for more details about these policies (Baccini et al. 2020). We draw social distancing data from Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. This data set captures visits to a location relative to a baseline day using data from users who have enabled “location history” in their Google account. The baseline day is the median value for the 5-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020. We rely on workplace as the location of interest as of April 1, 2020, i.e., the midpoint of the first COVID-19 wave. We also rely on mobility change as of August 1st as a robustness check, i.e., the midpoint of the second wave.11 We merge variables capturing COVID-19 incidence by county with data on county-level election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections.12 We compute the difference of vote shares of Trump between the 2020 and 2016 US presidential elections. Specifically, we compute shares dividing the total number of votes for Trump by the total number of votes in each county. Table 1 provides summary statistics, and Fig. 2 illustrates changes in voting share from 2016 to 2020. The map shows that Trump’s support fell in parts of the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt in 2020 compared with the 2016 presidential election.13 Descriptive statistics Authors’ calculations. Election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. Electoral outcomes are not weighted (by the number of registered voters). Changes in Trump voting (2020–2016) and Trump voting (2020) are in percentages. Cumulative COVID-19 cases, cases per 10,000 people, deaths, and deaths per 100,000 people are the cumulative totals corresponding to October 22, 2020. Share of employment in meat-processing factories is computed using data from the County Business Patterns. Monthly unemployment data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics Changes in share of votes for Donald Trump from 2016 to 2020. This figure illustrates the differential in vote shares for Trump in 2020 and 2016  We rely on the County Business Patterns (CBP) to compute the share of employment in meat-processing factories. Of note, there are jobs in this industry for about 52% of counties. The CBP provides annual data for establishments with paid employees within the USA. This data set provides annual employment data at the county-level for the week of March 12 and annual payroll data. Note that the CBP does not include employment for most establishments with government employees and the following NAICS industries: crop and animal production; rail transportation; Postal Service; pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; office of notaries; private households; and public administration. See https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/about.html for more details. Last, we get monthly unemployment rates at the county-level from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics. In our sample, the mean change in the unemployment rate from August 2019 to August 2020 was an increase of 2.87.14 We rely on four occupational indexes as control variables: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. The first three indexes were built in Beland et al. (2020), while the remote work index comes from Dingel and Neiman (2020). These indexes serve as covariates in our analysis since they have been shown to be related to the severity of job losses in the USA and could be related to voting behavior and COVID-19 incidence. In this section, we describe the empirical strategy that was pre-specified in a PAP. We first present our OLS model and provide evidence that our model is more appropriate than a naïve model relating COVID-19 incidence and Trump vote share. We then describe the IV specification, in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence with the share of employment in meat-processing plants. As stated in our PAP, we first rely on the following model: where Yc is the differential in Trump’s vote share in 2020 and 2016 for county c. COVIDIncidencec is the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants as of October 22, 2020.15 We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. We include in the model Xc, which is a vector of county-level variables. We include the following demographic and socioeconomic variables: population, share of female population, share of foreign-born population, share of population with a college degree, share of non-Hispanic Black population, share of non-Hispanic white population, share of population by age group (9 dummies), social mobility index, and four occupational indexes. Moreover, we compute employment changes due to the pandemic at the county-level by taking the unemployment rate as of September 2020 minus the unemployment rate as of September 2019.16 The inclusion of these variables is key to our identification assumption that no omitted variables are related to COVID-19 incidence and the change in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election. Finally, 𝜃s represents state fixed effects. This set of fixed effects allows us to further control for county-level characteristics that are common to counties within the same state. Our estimation is thus at the county-level and we effectively test whether counties with relatively more COVID-19 cases or deaths differentially voted for the Trump in 2020 compared with the previous presidential election. We use this model instead of a model relating COVID-19 incidence to vote share in 2020 alone to better capture trends in voting behavior. In other words, we compare how voting behavior changed pre- and post-COVID-19 rather than simply analyzing voting behavior post-COVID-19. We believe this is crucial in this context given the increasing political polarization in the USA. Moreover, we think that the inclusion of state fixed effects and controlling for social distancing and a large set of demographic variables helps account for differential (changes in) behavior and preferences across counties. This is also crucial because a growing literature has shown, for instance, that individuals identifying as Republicans are less likely to comply with social distancing orders than those identifying as Democrats (e.g., Allcott et al. 2020; Gollwitzer et al.2020). We complement the reduced form analysis with an instrumental variable approach. The concern we attempt to address is that COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths do not occur at random, but rather they correlate with individuals’ behavior, which may be different between those who vote for the Democratic Party and those who vote for the Republican Party. For instance, it may be that voters living in “red” (i.e., Republican-leaning) counties are less likely to observe social distancing or to wear masks. If this is the case, this type of behavior would be likely to increase the number of COVID-19 cases (and in turn COVID-19 deaths) and we would observe a larger share of votes for Trump than for Biden in the same counties. While we control for social distancing in the previous analysis, we may have missed some other confounders in our analysis. To attempt to achieve exogenous variation of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county-level, we instrument COVID-19 cases and deaths with the share of employment in meat-processing factories in each county. More specifically, we use the average number of workers in the NAICS industry code 3116, “Animal Slaughtering and Processing,” in each county between 2012 and 2015, i.e., before Trump’s presidency. We divide this number by the average number of total workers in each country during the same time frame, i.e., 2012–2015. Data come from the CBP and measure raw employment. The rationale for the instrument is that there is evidence of meat-processing plants becoming COVID-19 hotbeds due to their cold, humid environment and difficulties with workplace physical distancing.17 According to a CDC report on July 10, among 23 states reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and poultry facilities, 16,233 cases in 239 facilities occurred, including 86 (0.5%) COVID-19-related deaths.18 Based on cases reported by Johns Hopkins University, as of May 6, counties containing or within 15 miles of one or more meatpacking plants reported 373 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents.19 That is roughly double the US average of 199 cases per 100,000 in all counties with reported cases.20 The severity of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in meat-processing facilities prompted research on how to control the spread of the virus in these plants.21 Armed with this instrument, we estimate: where MEATc is the share of workers in meat-processing plants. We run a first stage in which we regress this variable on the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants at the county level, including all controls and state fixed effects as in Eq. 1. Then we plug in the predicted values of this first stage and estimate the second stage of the 2SLS. For our instrument to be valid two conditions have to hold. First, our instrument has to be a strong predictor of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories since the beginning of the pandemic for the (1) top 1% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories. This figure illustrates the cumulative number of number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories for the (1) top 1% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. Employment data is from the County Business Patterns This figure provides direct evidence that counties with a higher share of employment in meat-processing factories had a higher incidence of COVID-19 during the entire pandemic. COVID-19 case (and death) incidence is much larger for counties with a relatively high share of employment in meat-processing factories and much smaller for counties with no employment or positive employment share. This result suggests our first stage is strong and that the relationship between the share of employment in meat-processing factories and COVID-19 incidence is non-linear. Note also that the raw correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument is 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. The correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument conditional on controls and state fixed effect is much higher, i.e., above 0.5 for cases and 0.3 for deaths. Second, the identifying variance is the industrial composition of each county, specifically the presence of meat-processing factories. In order for our instrument to allow a causal interpretation, employment in meat-processing factories must only affect the change in voting behavior from 2016 to 2020 through its effect on COVID-19 cases and deaths, i.e., the exogeneity assumption. While there is no test to assess the validity of this assumption, we discuss other possible channels through which our instrument can affect the outcome variable and explain how we account for these channels. While we control for a host of variables that could potentially affect the exclusion restriction, we discuss here two main possible violations of the exogeneity assumption. First, we control for the share of manufacturing employment. We do so because it may be that counties with a large share of workers in manufacturing voted against Trump in 2020 due to job losses for which he was now held accountable as the incumbent president. It may also be that trade unions were more actively campaigning against Trump in 2020 than they were in 2016, since he was the incumbent Republican president. In an effort to isolate the effect of our instrument on COVID-19 cases, we also include the share of workers in food manufacturing, i.e., NAICS industry code 311, to which “Animal Slaughtering and Processing” belongs. Including this variable implies that every possible violation of the exclusion restriction has to be specific to the meat-processing industry. In the same spirit, we are concern that Trump policies—both those related and those unrelated to trade—did not specifically affect meat packaging industry. We thus include the China trade shock variable, which captures the vulnerability of US manufacturing counties to foreign competition especially from China.22Autor et al. (2020) show that the China trade shock increased Trump’s vote in 2016 and, in the same vein, it could have decreased his electoral support in 2020 as the incumbent president. Second, it may be that Trump’s trade policies have negatively affected meat sales, and in turn this could have led to a loss of support among workers in this industry and in surrounding communities. Kim and Margalit (2021) provide evidence of that. For addressing this concern, we include variables capturing the potential impact of Chinese tariffs and US tariffs on the workforce in each county.23 Note also that the correlation between our instrument and the share of manufacturing employment and share of employment in food manufacturing is 0.3 and 0.4 respectively, whereas the correlation between our instrument and the other controls is never higher than 0.1.24 In Appendix Table 8, we provide empirical evidence that COVID-19 incidence is significantly related to votes for Trump in 2016 and 2020. We then provide evidence that COVID-19 incidence in our models is not successfully predicting changes in voting behavior for previous presidential elections. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). In panel A (B), the dependent variable is the vote share for Trump in the 2020 (2016) presidential election, whereas the dependent variable in panel C is the change in votes for Trump from 2012 to 2016. Columns 1 and 4 include only state fixed effects and our demographic controls, while columns 2 and 3 sequentially add socioeconomic controls and our social distancing indicator. Placebo analysis using previous presidential elections Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Each point estimate is from a different regression. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2020 (OLS). In panel B, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2016 (OLS). In panel C, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (OLS). In panel D, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (2SLS). In panel E, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2012 and 2008 (2SLS). In panel F, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2008 and 2004 (2SLS). The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes The estimates in panels A and B are positive and significant, suggesting that counties with more Trump’s supporters had larger numbers of COVID-19 cases. The fact that both estimates are positive and significant for both the 2016 and the 2020 presidential elections suggest that this model is misspecified and that a naïve estimation would conclude that COVID-19 incidence helped Trump during the 2020 presidential election.25 In contrast, the estimates are imprecisely estimated and statistically insignificant in all columns in panel C, suggesting that using the differential in voting is more appropriate than using the vote share for the current elections. We also provide placebo evidence that our IV method leads to null findings for previous presidential elections. The estimates are presented in panels D, E, and F. The dependent variables are respectively the differential in vote share for the Republican Party for the elections in 2016 and 2012 (panel D), in 2012 and 2008 (panel E), and in 2008 and 2004 (panel F). The point estimates for COVID-19 cases are all statistically insignificant and much smaller than our 2SLS estimates for 2016–2020. These results provide evidence that our empirical models are properly specified. In this section, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 incidence on voting behavior using OLS and 2SLS. We focus on COVID-19 cases in the main analysis. We note again that our analysis and choice of control variables were fully detailed in our pre-analysis plan. Table 2 contains OLS estimates of Eq. 1 (columns 1–3). The sample size is 2689 observations (i.e., counties).26 The dependent variable is the differential in vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and 2016. A positive value indicates that Trump received more votes in 2020 than in 2016. We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. The variables of interest are the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The impact of COVID-19 cases: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county (n = 2, 689). Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019 What clearly emerges is that COVID-19 cases are negatively related to votes for Trump during the 2020 presidential election in comparison to the 2016 election. In column 1, we include state fixed effects and our set of demographic and socioeconomic controls. We find that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 0.12 percentage points on average. The point estimate is statistically significant at about the 10% level. In column 2, we add to the model our indicator of social distancing, i.e., time spent at workplaces in April 2020. Column 3 is our most extensive model specification. We saturate our model with all the previous controls and state fixed effects. In addition, we add to the model the unemployment change from before to during COVID-19. The magnitude of the estimates and statistical significance remain the same. In column 4, we add to the model a quadratic term of COVID-19 cases. The quadratic term of COVID-19 cases is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level, but very small in magnitude (6.10e-08). In contrast, the magnitude and sign of the coefficient of our variable of interest, cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000, remain the same. This result suggests that the negative effect of additional COVID-19 cases on Trump’s 2020 vote share becomes slightly smaller as the number of cases increases. Of note, the coefficient of unemployment change (August 2019 to August 2020) is small and statistically insignificant.27 Our results thus suggest that job losses during the pandemic are not significantly related to voting behavior and that increases in the unemployment rate does not seem to be a major factor behind the negative effect of COVID-19 on the share of votes for Trump. A possible explanation is that job losses are triggered by policies, e.g., lockdowns, implemented by the states, which Trump opposed or at the very least for which Trump cannot be held directly responsible. The coefficients for some of the other control variables are worth discussing (not shown for space consideration). We find that the share of women is strongly negatively correlated with the change in vote share for Trump. Similarly, Trump seems to have lost vote share in counties with a high share of adults aged 25–54. Our OLS results provide suggestive evidence that the pandemic affected the 2020 presidential election. The main concern with our OLS estimates is that omitted variables could be related to both COVID-19 incidence and differential voting behavior in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. We now turn to our instrumental variable strategy. In Table 2 (columns 5–7), we present the first stage (panel A) and the two-stage estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in the first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. We control for our usual set of fixed effects and control variables. As shown in Fig. 3, we find that the share of employment in meat-processing factories is strongly positively correlated with COVID-19 incidence. The coefficient is always significant and the F-statistics indicate no concern of a weak instrument. Our second-stage estimates are presented in the bottom panel (columns 4–6). We find that counties with more COVID-19 cases substantially decreased their vote share for Trump in 2020. The 2SLS estimates are larger than the OLS estimates and suggest that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 1.2 percentage point on average.28 The point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level and robust to the inclusion of our large set of controls and the share of manufacturing employment as well as the share of employment in food manufacturing. So far, our analysis has underscored an important finding: the COVID-19 pandemic costs Trump votes. But is this effect large enough to have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election? To answer this question, we conduct a simple counterfactual exercise to determine the magnitude of the effect by exploring how the composition of votes in a number of closely contested states would have differed if there had been fewer COVID-19 cases. The computation of the counterfactual is based on the coefficient estimate in column 1 of Table 2. For each county, we compute the fraction of total votes that Trump would have received if the number of COVID-19 cases had been X% smaller as − 0.0012 ×COVIDc × X% – i.e., the point estimate of the effect of COVIDc on Trump’s vote share from the OLS estimates, the size of each county’s measured COVID-19 cases, and the scaling factor X%. We next multiply this product by the number of total votes in a county to calculate the number of additional votes that Trump would have received in the counterfactual scenario. We then aggregate these county-level votes into state totals. To allow for the margin of error in our counterfactual calculations, we use the lower and upper bounds of our estimate (i.e., 0.0012), using the 90% confidence interval. We report these bounds in parenthesis. Table 3 presents the results of this counterfactual analysis. Column 1 shows the actual vote margin in favor of Biden in the 2020 election for a set of closely contested states. The three subsequent columns show counterfactual outcomes had COVID-19 cases been 5% or 10% or 20% fewer. Since we find that the COVID incidence decreased Trump’s vote share, the counterfactual analyses for fewer COVID-19 cases correspondingly increase Trump’s counterfactual vote totals. The results in Table 3 show that, ceteris paribus, Trump would have won Michigan in a counterfactual scenario with 20% fewer cases. Trump would have won Pennsylvania with 10% fewer COVID-19 cases. He would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, with 5% fewer COVID-19 cases. Under this last counterfactual, Trump would have been reelected. Even if we consider the lower bound calculations, which are very conservative, Trump would have kept the presidency with 21% fewer cases. Counterfactual outcomes in closely contested states won by Biden The computation of the counterfactual is based on the estimate from the OLS model. An increase in per COVID-19 cases reduces Trump’s share of vote by 0.0012 percentage points (see column 3 in Table 2). The actual outcome in column 2 reports the margin in favor of Biden in each state. Negative values indicate that Biden won the state in 2020. The reported values in columns 3 and 4 are estimated margins in favor of Trump in the counterfactual scenario of fewer COVID-19 cases. The numbers in parentheses are the lower and upper bound on these calculations, using the 90% confidence intervals of our OLS estimate. A positive value in columns 3 or 4 larger than the negative value in column 2 implies that Trump would have won the state We investigate heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 on voting in Table 4. In columns 1 and 2, we first investigate whether the effect of COVID-19 incidence is larger/smaller for states that have implemented a stay-at-home order than for states that did not implement such a policy during the pandemic. Data on stay-at-home order comes from Raifman et al. (2020) and only include directives/orders for the entire state, i.e., did not include guidance or recommendations. Of note, all states without a stay-at-home order are states that Trump won in 2016. Our 2SLS estimates suggest that COVID-19 had a larger effect in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order during the pandemic. This result seems to suggest that if Trump had taken the pandemic more seriously and had placed more emphasis on health and safety issues, he would have lost less electorally and he would have had higher chances to get re-elected. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by state and county characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (Eq. 2). In columns 1 and 2, we restrict the sample to counties in states that implemented a stay-at-home order during the pandemic and counties in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order, respectively. In columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016 for states that Trump and Clinton won, respectively. Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (panel A) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (panel B), respectively. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing Columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016, for Trump’s and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s states separately. We define states as Trump’s or Clinton’s using the electoral votes for the 2016 US presidential election.29 We find that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by those states that he won in the 2016 presidential election. The magnitude of the coefficient is about 50% larger than the magnitude of the coefficient in the entire sample.30 In contrast, the coefficient of COVID-19 cases is small, positive, and not significant in those states that Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election (column 2).31 Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states.32 Our results indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is almost twice as large in swing states as it is in non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. We define a county as “urban” (“rural”) if over (below) 50% of its population was living in an urban area in 2010 (US Census). Our results show that urban counties drive the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote. Indeed, the effect is negative and significant in the urban sample, whereas it is smaller and statistically insignificant in rural counties. In Table 5, we investigate heterogeneity by county demographic characteristics. We find that negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger for countries below the median percentage of residents aged 65 than for counties above the median percentage of residents aged 65. Our estimates also indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger in more racially diverse counties (i.e., those with white population shares below the median). Furthermore, our findings show that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by less educated counties (i.e., those with a below-median share of residents with college degrees), which may help explain Biden’s victory in the Rust Belt. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by demographic characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for the Republican Party in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (2). We restrict the sample to counties: below (column 1) and above (column 2) the median percentage of residents aged 65; below (column 3) and above (column 4) the median percentage of white (non Hispanic) residents; and below (column 5) and above (column 6) the median percentage of residents who attended college. The variable of interest is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic, and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing  We now check whether our results are robust to the use of COVID-19 deaths instead of cases. Table 6 shows our estimates. We do not find any evidence that COVID-19 deaths are related to changes in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election with our OLS model. The estimates are all statistically insignificant. For our 2SLS estimates, our first stage is weaker than for cases, with F-statistics ranging from 2 in the less parsimonious model to 6 in our model with the full set of controls. The 2SLS estimates are all negative and of similar magnitude as our 2SLS estimates for cases, but more imprecise with only the estimate in column 6 being statistically significant at conventional levels. The impacts of COVID-19 deaths: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing The fact that our 2SLS estimates are of about the same magnitude for cases and deaths suggests that our conclusions are similar when using deaths instead of cases. Nonetheless, two differences are worth mentioning. First, our instrumental variable is only weakly related to COVID-19 deaths.33 The probability that a COVID-19 infection results in death rises dramatically with age, and we expect that this and other factors such as healthcare coverage may contribute to the divergence in estimated effects. Second, it is plausible that voters are less aware or less likely to know someone who has died of COVID-19 than to know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  One of the defining outcomes of the 2020 presidential election was the record-high turnout. Both presidential candidates would had won any previous elections, given their number of votes at the national-level. We use differences in total votes between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections as a rough proxy of turnout. We run the same model specification as in Eqs. 1 and 2. We show the results in Table 7. The impact of COVID-19 cases on total votes: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–3 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 4–6 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 4–6). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in total votes from 2016 to 2020. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing We find no evidence that COVID-19 cases affected voters’ mobilization in the OLS estimates.34 On the contrary, there is some evidence that the incidence of COVID-19 boosts turnout in the 2SLS. These conflicting results on the effect of the pandemic on mobilization are also found in previous studies that explore this topic in different electoral contexts (Giommoni and Loumeau 2020; Fernández-Navia et al. 2020).35  We provide many robustness checks for our 2SLS results in Baccini et al. (2020). For instance, we add to the models well-known predictors of voting behavior or COVID-19 incidence. We show that our results are robust to controlling for the China shock variable (Autor et al. (2020)) and two variables capturing Chinese tariffs and protection by US tariffs at the county-level from Kim and Margalit (2021). The rationale for including these variables has been explained in the previous section. We also show that our estimates are robust to the inclusion of weather controls such as precipitation and air pollution (i.e., PM2.5 and precipitation for the first months of the pandemic),36 the share of employment in nursing care facilities,37 county-to-county (in and out) migration, and the duration (in days) of the following statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for out-of-state individuals.38 Overall, the inclusion of one or all of these control variables has no effect on the magnitude and significance of our 2SLS estimates. We also check whether our OLS and 2SLS point estimates vary if we change the date for the moment in which we calculate the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. As stated in our pre-analysis plan, we rely on October 22nd for our main analysis. In a set of robustness checks, we instead rely on July 1st, August 1st, September 1st, and August 1st. The estimates for the OLS are all larger and more significant than for our baseline, i.e., cases as of October 22nd, suggesting that we are very conservative in estimating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the differential in votes for Trump. For the 2SLS, the point estimates all range from − 0.011 to − 0.013 and are statistically significant at the 1% level. Similarly, changing the start period to April or May, i.e., excluding cases that occurred early on in the pandemic, has no impact on our conclusions. Last, we show that our conclusions are robust to using a different geographical level for the analysis. In Baccini et al. (2020), we replicate our main analysis using commuting zones as our unit of analysis. Commuting zones are significantly larger than counties, which provides the advantage that the distribution of employment in the meat-processing industry is less limited geographically, since many commuting zones have at least one meat-processing factory.39 This paper explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election using both a reduced form and IV approach. Our key finding is that COVID-19 cases decreased electoral support for Trump. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have been reelected. We find that the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential elections, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that worsening economic conditions reduced electoral support for Trump. The 2SLS estimates show evidence that COVID-19 cases affect positively voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. At least two explanations are consistent with these findings. First, voters may have electorally sanctioned Trump for how he handled the pandemic, which was at odds with most major countries, and widely criticized. This explanation is consistent with a retrospective voting approach (Fiorina 1981; Fearon 1999; Norpoth 2001), in which voters sanction incumbents for their handling of negative shocks. Second, some voters may have switched from Trump to Biden due to changes in preferences triggered by the pandemic and the recession. In particular, a severe public health threat and major economic losses may have shifted preferences in favor of an expansion of the social safety net, including healthcare and unemployment insurance programs (Rees-Jones et al. 2020b). Since the Democratic Party is more likely to champion these policies, Biden benefited from this switch in voters’ preferences. This explanation is in line with studies claiming that political preferences are shaped by personal experience. If it is true that these changes in preferences are long lasting (Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014), the Democratic Party may be able to capitalize electorally in future elections. Our empirical analysis is unable to tease out which of these two channels is operative; this remains an important task for future research. Future studies should also explore how turnout, which was quite high for the 2020 presidential election but for which granular data is not yet available, influenced the results reported in this paper. Finally, when individual-level survey data become available, it will be important to explore how voter heterogeneity in race, age, and other characteristics conditions voters’ responses to the pandemic.

For the empirical analysis, we follow the specifications and test the hypotheses detailed in our pre-analysis plan (PAP). Our PAP was archived on October 30, 2020, at https://osf.io/xvuzp/, 4 days prior to the Presidential Elections. We relied on a PAP to minimize issues of specification searching and p-hacking. Another advantage of relying on a PAP is that it allowed us to think carefully about the analyses to be conducted prior to the outcome of the Presidential Elections. This is potentially important given the growing concerns that social science researchers may be politically biased. We aimed to follow the PAP to the greatest extent possible, but made some modifications following suggestions from other researchers and reviewers, and gaining access to the voting data. We try to be as transparent as possible and list all the modifications made to the pre-analysis plan and supplementary analyses not included in the PAP in Baccini et al. (2020).

A growing literature documents the extent of p-hacking in the social sciences, highlighting that the extent of p-hacking is larger for observational studies than for experimental studies (e.g., Brodeur et al. 2020). 4For an excellent review of this literature, see Healy and Malhotra (2020). 5https://www.ajmc.com/view/a-timeline-of-covid19-developments-in-2020https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-timeline-tracking-critical-moments-covid-19-n1154341. 6https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality. 7https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/10/politics/covid-disappearing-trump-comment-tracker/. 8https://news.gallup.com/poll/203207/trump-job-approval-weekly.aspx. 9https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/ 10https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/321698/covid-responses-men-women.aspx (consulted on November 4, 2020). 11See Brodeur et al. (2020) for a review of studies using cellphone data to measure mobility during the pandemic. 12Data can be purchased from https://uselectionatlas.org/BOTTOM/store_data.php. 13Of note, Trump won relatively more sparsely populated counties while Biden won relatively more densely populated counties. This explains that the mean of the variable “Trump Voting (2020)” is 63%. Note that our variables and estimates are unweighted throughout. We show that our results are robust to different weighting schemes in Baccini et al. (2020). 14The increase in the unemployment rate was much larger during the months of April and May 2020. Also note that the increase in unemployment does not include workers who are currently employed but are not working due to lockdowns. See Beland et al. (2020) for a discussion. 15We follow our PAP in using October 22, 2020, for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, we check the robustness of our results using other dates for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. See the “3.3 section for more details. 16Relying on different months for the before and during COVID-19 periods has no effect on our conclusion that job losses are not related to differential voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 elections. 17https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/health/meat-processing-plants-coronavirus-intl/index.html(consulted on October 5, 2020). 18https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6927e2.htm (consulted on October 5 2020). 19News about these cases are distributed by the media across counties and have therefore a general effect, although these news may have more weights in counties with a large share of workers employed in meat-processing plants. 20https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-ratehttps://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-rate(consulted on October 5 2020). 21https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilitieshttps://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilities(consulted on October 5, 2020). 22The China shock variable is a Bartik measure capturing rising Chinese imports to the USA in each industry i, weighted by baseline share of workers in the same industry i in each county. This variable varies both across counties and over time. The over-time variation is given by the difference in imports from China to the USA between 2000 (i.e., pre-accession to the WTO) to the period 2016–2019 (i.e., average value over this 4-year window). 23These variables are built by matching the list of targeted commodities (by China and the USA) to industry classifications and constructing an original measure of the county-level share of employment targeted in each round of retaliatory tariffs. Data come from Kim and Margalit (2021). 24We also implemented the plausibly exogenous test as suggested by Conley et al. (2012). The result of the test, which is available upon request, shows that our instrument is plausibly exogenous with p < 0.1. In other words, the effect of the instrumented variable, i.e., cases, remains negative with a 90% confidence interval. 25Press analyses indicate a positive correlation between COVID-19 cases and Trump’s support. See for instance, “Counties with worst virus surges overwhelmingly voted Trump” by AP news, available at https://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebfhttps://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebf. 26We lose about 400 observations (i.e., counties) because of lack of data for our social distancing indicator. Excluding this control variable and doing the analysis on the full set of counties has no effect on our main conclusions. 27Using the change in unemployment for different dates does not affect our conclusions. For instance, measuring unemployment during the first wave of COVID-19 (i.e., April 2020) instead of the month of August 2020 leads to similar estimates and has no effect on the magnitude or significance of the COVID-19 cases variable. 28There are many plausible explanations for why our 2SLS estimates are larger than our OLS estimates. First, there is a great deal of measurement error in our estimation. Second, we are estimating a local average treatment effect (LATE) with our IV estimation. Voting behavior in counties with relatively more employment in meat-processing factories may be differently affected by the pandemic than counties with no or a small share of employment in this industry. For instance, counties with employment in meat-processing factories are significantly more populous than counties without any jobs in this industry. 29We classify Maine as a blue state. This has no effect on our conclusions. 30The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants varies across Trump’s states (271) and Clinton’s states (166). 31We also tested the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in red states, for states with and without stay-at-home order. Our 2SLS estimates suggest a large negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote for both sets of red states, but that the effect is larger for states without stay-at-home orders. 32We classify states as swing or non-swing using the NYT classification available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/electoral-college-battleground-states.html, consulted on November 2, 2020. We consider swing states as states categorized as tossup and leaning Democratic: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. 33There is a very small differences in death per capita since mid-September 2020 for counties with and without employment in meat-processing factories. 34We also find no evidence that the quadratic terms for COVID-19 deaths are related to Trump vote share in 2020 in comparison to 2016. 35We also investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases on the number of votes for Trump and the Democratic Party separately. The estimates are presented in Baccini et al. (2020). We do not find evidence that COVID-19 is related to the number of votes for Trump in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our OLS and 2SLS models. But we do find some evidence that COVID-19 cases are positively and significantly related to total votes for the Democratic Party in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our 2SLS models. 36A number of studies provide suggestive evidence that air pollution may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death (Wu et al. 2020). 37http://jedkolko.com/2020/10/18/the-geography-of-the-covid19-third-wave/ (consulted on November 2, 2020). 38Note that we only have data for statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions. One exception is for stay-at-home orders, which have been implemented by some cities and counties prior to statewide orders. Typically, the city or county order precedes the statewide order by few days. 39Our first stage F-statistics at the commuting zone-level are smaller than at the county-level, ranging around 10. The magnitude of the first stage coefficients is larger at the commuting zone-level than at the county-level, suggesting that COVID infections spread to neighboring counties.

(AP) — Nikki Haley’s team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she’ll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Ahead of a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she’s staying in the race no matter what at least until after another 20 states vote through Super Tuesday on March 5. That’s even as Donald Trump’s MAGA movement is furious that she’s refusing to drop out. After all, she’s the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy ahead of the big speech. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: SHE’S NOT QUITTING Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press that she’s not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that’s even if she’s blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday’s South Carolina primary. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In case you don’t believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. She’s spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. THE LOSSES MAY PILE UP Just don’t ask Haley which primary state she’s going to win. It’s a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren’t willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can’t. That’s because polls suggest she’s a major underdog in virtually every state — even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor — given Trump’s grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party’s most energized partisans — not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” she said. Still, Haley’s team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump — especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM Stop us if you’ve heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he’s betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump’s legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There’s also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren’t ready to surrender to Trump’s MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. LEANING INTO TRUMP LEGAL ISSUES As Trump calls Haley names like “stupid” and “birdbrain,” Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president’s legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much — or more — time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump’s political standing would change dramatically if he’s a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal “piggy bank” for his legal fees. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” And she didn’t exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. “Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he’s going to have to defend himself,” she said in drawing a clear distinction. LONG TERM OUTLOOK HAZY Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party’s July national convention. But Haley said she isn’t yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she’d drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party’s presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that’s likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she’d help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. “I don’t know what actions I’m gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,” Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn’t feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. “I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,” Haley said. “I’m running as a Republican. That’s my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.”  Steve Peoples, The Associated Press   1316 Central Ave

,,"Trump Tells His Supporters Not to Vote in the Next Election, Which Would Actually Be Great for Humanity","  BY BESS LEVIN If you’ve lived through the last five years and haven’t been forced to medicate yourself to the point of unconsciousness, you’re probably aware that Donald Trump has been very bad for society, on account of the racism and the corruption and the mass casualties and the general, ongoing assault on democracy. Because of that, it would be ideal if neither the 45th president nor his acolytes sat at the seat of power ever again, though, unfortunately, that’s no sure thing. For one thing, Republicans have a shot at flipping the Senate in 2022, and there are a disturbing number of GOP lawmakers there whom Trump has wrapped around his morally bankrupt finger. For another, Trump is reportedly “laying the groundwork” for a 2024 run, and if you recall, 74 million people inexplicably voted for him in 2020, which wasn’t enough to actually win but was a disturbing number nevertheless. Obviously also at issue is that since Trump lost to Joe Biden, Republicans have responded by attempting to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible. Allies of the former guy have been paving the way to meddle in future elections by passing bills that “allow Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds,” which would, per The Atlantic, let state legislatures or their appointees interfere “in local decision-making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona, Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020: throw out ballots in rival strongholds in order to overturn a statewide result.” Which is bone-chillingly terrifying. But you know what would be great? If somehow we could wave a magic wand and ensure that none of the people who support Trump or Trump-endorsed candidates show up to vote, which would be a tremendous turn of events for humanity, though one that would clearly never happen unless—what? What’s that you say? Donald Trump has, in an incredible self-own, told his base to stay home and not vote in the next two elections? To honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it originates from. Setting aside for a moment the idea of Trump instructing millions of people not to vote, which would have the obvious effect of helping the other side, it’s important to note that Trump is still—still!—clinging to the idea that the 2020 election was stolen and there is a chance it could be overturned and he could be “reinstated” at the White House. That’s extremely scary because, in case anyone missed it the first thousand times, there is absolutely zero evidence that fraud played a role in the last election, despite multiple attempts by conservatives to conduct “audits” of results in battleground states, which have thus far only proven how badly Trump lost. Nevertheless, we absolutely love the idea of Trump throwing a hissy fit and saying, “Oh yeah? You won’t overturn Joe Biden’s win? My people will show you!” First, because it underscores how very, very stupid he is, and second, because he and his allies have done this in the past and it predictably worked out great for Democrats. As the Daily Beast notes: After prominent Trump supporters similarly told Georgia Republicans to sit out the two runoffs in that state late last year, calling it “another rigged election,” voters ended up giving Democrats control of the Senate. As Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings told Politico in January, “That’s on [Trump]. He told them their votes didn’t count, and some of them listened.” In a sad attempt to spin Trump’s directive as the exact opposite of what he said, GOP rally organizer John Fredericks told The Washington Post he thought Trump was simply warning voters that they need to get more involved to safeguard future elections, an explanation we’re sure the ex-president will blow up by clarifying that no, he specifically meant for people to stay home.

,,Political positions of Joe Biden,"   Joe Biden, President of the United States, served as Vice President from 2009 to 2017 and in the United States Senate from 1973 until 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, he made his second presidential run in 2008, later being announced as Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate in 2008. He was elected vice president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. In April 2019, Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign.[1] He became the presumptive Democratic nominee in April 2020,[2] was formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August 2020,[3] and defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.[4] Over his career, Biden has generally been regarded as belonging to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.[5][6] Biden has been described as center[7][8][9] to center-left[10] and has described himself as the latter.[11] Figures farther to the left such as Bernie Sanders have criticized Biden for not embracing Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Biden's policies emphasize the needs of middle-class and working-class Americans[12] and have drawn political support from those groups.[13] Biden has supported campaign finance reform including the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and overturning Citizens United;[14][15] the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act;[16] the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[17][18] student tax credits;[19] carbon emissions cap and trade;[20] the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration;[18] mass transit;[21] renewable energy subsidies;[20] student loan forgiveness;[22] and reversals of Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.[23][12][24] He supports building upon the Affordable Care Act through a public health insurance option instead of a single-payer system.[25][26] He supports decriminalizing cannabis at the federal level and the right for states to legalize it.[27] Biden has been publicly in favor of same-sex marriage since 2012 when he became the highest-ranking U.S. official to voice support for same-sex marriage, preempting Obama on the subject.[28] He also supports the Roe v. Wade decision and since 2019 has been in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.[29][30] In a 2019 article about Biden's record on abortion, his press secretary Jamal Brown said that when Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 he thought Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, but now ""firmly believes that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and should not be overturned"". In 1981, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe v. Wade. In 1982, he voted against the same failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe, and in 2006, he stated in an interview that ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy[.]""[31] He now says he would consider codifying the Roe precedent into federal law in case the United States Supreme Court overturns the ruling.[32][33] He pledged that he would appoint United States Supreme Court justices who shared his beliefs in upholding Roe.[34] From 1976 to June 5, 2019, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment.[35][36] On June 6, 2019, Biden reversed his support and now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment.[37] In 1981, he voted to end federal funding for abortion for victims of rape and incest.[32] Biden previously supported the Mexico City policy, but now supports repealing it.[33] In 2003, Biden voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.[38] In 2007, he opposed the United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart which upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. He defended his opposition, saying he opposed the court's reasoning for the ruling, not the decision itself.[39] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's leading opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[40] In his first Senate campaign, Biden expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[41] In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment.[42] Later, Biden was heckled when he told a meeting of Delaware parents that his position on busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions.[further explanation needed][43] This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with anti-busing senators.[40] In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;[44] he said busing was a ""bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense"" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[45] At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities, and voting rights.[42] In 1977 Biden then voted against integration stating he did not want his children going to school in a ""racial jungle"". Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1978.[46] Biden has supported affirmative action policies.[47] Since June 20, 2019, Biden opposes capital punishment. Biden supports legislation to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and incentivize states to abolish capital punishment. He supports individuals on death row instead serving life sentences without probation or parole.[48][49] Prior to June 20, 2019, he had supported capital punishment. He originally wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act included Title VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, creating 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes,[50] for crimes related to acts of terrorism, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death. However, he voted against limiting appeals in capital cases and also opposed rejecting racial statistics in death penalty appeals.[citation needed] Biden helped author the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which deployed and trained more police officers, increased prison sentences, and built more prisons. The bill led to a decrease in crime rates[citation needed] while also introducing the Violence Against Women Act. Part of the bill was an assault weapon ban and additional money was redirected towards crime prevention programs. Some critics say that the law had the unintended by-effect of creating a financial incentive for jailing people and keeping them there for longer periods of time; this had a disproportionate impact on minorities.[51] In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a slogan of ""defund the police"" arose, which some interpreted to mean the abolition of police departments. Biden stated in a June 2020 opinion piece, ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police."" President Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that Biden supports ""defunding police""; the Trump campaign spent at least $20 million in July 2020 on campaign ads promoting the falsehood.[52][53] As a senator, Biden had long forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure which was supported by police unions but opposed by police chiefs.[54][55] As a 2020 presidential candidate, Biden faced criticism from some on the left for his proposal to double federal spending for community policing programs, to $300 million.[56] He called for racial justice while speaking at George Floyd's funeral service.[57] In September 2020, he condemned the institutional racism in the United States and police violence against African American communities.[58] Biden earned a reputation for being a ""drug warrior"", leading efforts in the war on drugs.[59] During the 1980s crack epidemic when both Democrats and Republicans were ""tough on crime"", Biden was the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee that passed numerous punitive measures against drug offenders. In 1986, Biden sponsored and co-wrote the Anti-Drug Abuse Act which caused a large disparity between the sentencing of crack cocaine and powder cocaine users. Black drug users were more likely than whites to use crack and hence were incarcerated in larger numbers.[60][61] He later acknowledged the negative consequences of the legislation and in 2010 supported the Fair Sentencing Act.[62] The bill eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine, and aimed to reduce the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses.[63] Biden favored increased funding for anti-drug efforts. He frequently criticized President Ronald Reagan in this regard,[64] stating in 1982 that the administration's ""commitment is minuscule in terms of dollars"".[65] He also criticized President George H. W. Bush's anti-drug strategy as ""not tough enough, bold enough or imaginative enough"",[66] stating that ""what we need is another D-Day, not another Vietnam, not a limited war, fought on the cheap"".[64] In 1982, Biden advocated for the creation of a drug czar, a government official overseeing all anti-drug operations. This led to the establishment of the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.[59] Biden also supported increased penalties against those caught selling drugs within 1,000 feet of schools.[67] Biden advocated for increased use of civil asset forfeiture by law enforcement agencies.[66] Biden played a key part in the passage of the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act in 1983, partnering with Strom Thurmond, a conservative Republican. A Washington Post article described Biden's role in the negotiations: ""He got the Democrats to agree to strengthen forfeiture laws and allow judges to hold more defendants without bail; he persuaded the Republicans to drop such controversial provisions as a federal death penalty, and he made sure Thurmond got most of the credit. Civil liberties groups said the measure could have been far worse without Biden.""[68] In the early 2000s, Biden was critical of raves, describing most of them as ""havens"" for use of ecstasy and other illegal drugs.[69] He was the sponsor of the bipartisan Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act in 2002; the bill's successor, the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, was later enacted as part of a broader 2003 crime bill that became law.[69][70] The legislation, an expansion of the existing 1986 federal anti-""crack house"" statute, provided for civil and criminal penalties for event promoters and property owners/managers who knowingly allowed their property to be used for sale or consumption of drugs.[71] The legislation was opposed by the ACLU and electronic dance music enthusiasts who viewed it as overly broad.[70][72] Responding to criticism, Biden said that the statute would not target law-abiding promoters, saying on the Senate floor: ""The reason I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill 'the rave scene' or silence electronic music—all things of which I have been accused. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or expression. It is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids.""[70] Although the law has been rarely used, advocates such as Drug Policy Alliance and DanceSafe argue that it discourages event producers from engaging in harm reduction efforts, and have sought to clarify the law.[73] Biden opposed the legalization of marijuana as a young senator in 1974, in contrast to his other more liberal views.[74] In 2010 he maintained this position, stating: ""I still believe it's a gateway drug. I've spent a lot of my life as chairman of the Judiciary Committee dealing with this. I think it would be a mistake to legalize.""[66] In a 2014 interview, Biden said, ""I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources"" but said, ""Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization.""[75] In 2019 and 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden expressed support for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing medical marijuana; reclassifying it as a Schedule II drug to ease marijuana research; automatically expunging prior convictions for marijuana convictions; and allowing states to legalize without federal interference.[76][77] In October 2022, President Biden announced that all federal convictions for simple marijuana possession would be pardoned, while also announcing that he would initiate a review to determine how cannabis should be scheduled under federal law, adding that the Schedule I classification of cannabis ""makes no sense"".[78][79] As Vice President, Biden actively engaged with Central American leaders on issues of drug cartels, drug trafficking, and migration to the U.S. caused by insecurity and drug violence. (See Central America below.) Biden was a major author of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990[80] and voted in favor of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994.[81] He voted in favor of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, but in 2007 called for the legislation to be scrapped or overhauled.[82] He supports class size reductions and investment in early childhood education.[82] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has proposed tripling Title I funds (which go to low-income schools) to pay for increases in student supports and teacher salaries; doubling the number of school guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, and nurses; providing for universal prekindergarten, and fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act within a decade.[80] Biden also supports federal infrastructure legislation providing funding for school buildings; allowing high school students to use Pell Grants for dual enrollment; and expanding career and technical education through school/community college/employer partnerships.[80] Biden opposes federal funding for for-profit charter schools (which make up a small percentage of charter schools)[83][84] and opposes ""private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer–funded resources away from the public school system.""[84] He supports allowing parents and students to choose between traditional public schools, magnet schools and ""high-performing"" charter schools.[84] Biden's plans have been praised by the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers,[83] the major U.S. teachers' unions, which both endorsed Biden in 2020.[85][86] In April 2020, Biden proposed forgiving student debt from public colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, for people earning up to $125,000 per year.[22] Throughout his career, Biden has supported gun control measures.[87] Although he voted for the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act, a bill supported by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) that passed the Senate 79–15, Biden also authored the 1993 federal assault weapons ban, and is a longtime supporter of universal background checks, and received ""F"" ratings from the NRA while he was in Congress.[88] The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[89][90] Biden supported the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established five-day waiting periods for handgun purchases and background checks.[91] He had a central role in the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which banned the manufacture, transfer, or possession of certain firearms classified as assault weapons (with a grandfather clause excepting guns owned prior to its implementation).[92] After the ban expired in 2004, Biden voted in favor of renewing it in a 2007 Senate vote.[87] The Obama/Biden administration also unsuccessfully pressed for renewal of the ban.[92] Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) of 2005, which immunizes firearm manufacturers from lawsuits based on gun violence.[87] After the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, Obama named Biden to lead a task force on gun violence and community safety.[93][94][95] Biden and the administration proposed universal background checks (with an exception for gun transfers between family members),[96] resumption of public health research on gun violence, and reinstatement of the federal assault weapons ban.[93][94][95] Proposals requiring legislative action were killed in the Republican-controlled Congress[93][94][95] amid opposition from the NRA.[96] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden's proposals on gun violence include universal background checks for gun sales, repeal of PLCAA, reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines, and incentives for states to adopt red flag laws.[94] Biden owns two shotguns.[97][98] After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist attack, Biden drafted anti-terrorist legislation, which was ultimately defeated. He later claimed publicly on several occasions that the USA PATRIOT Act, which eased restrictions on the Executive branch in the surveillance and detention of those suspected of terrorism or facilitating it, was essentially a duplicate of the anti-terrorist legislation he had drafted years earlier.[99] Biden supported the PATRIOT Act but voted to limit wiretapping on the bill. He supports implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to fight terrorists but voted to preserve habeas corpus rights to the alleged terror suspects serving in Guantanamo Bay. In the 1990s, he voted in favor of 36 vetoed military projects and supports efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. He was given a 60% approval rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reflecting a mixed voting record on civil rights issues. During a debate on November 15, 2007, Biden clarified the PATRIOT Act's effect, his continued support for it, and his opposition to racial profiling.[100] On the War on Terror, Biden voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.[101][102] While in the Senate, Biden voted in favor of the 1986 immigration bill (which passed) and the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill (which failed).[103] In a 2007 Democratic presidential primary debate, Biden said that it would be impractical and expensive to deport every unauthorized immigrant in the U.S. and proposed an earned path to citizenship, saying: ""Get a background check on all of them, take out the criminals, get them back, and provide for a means by which we allow earned citizenship over the next decade or so. Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical.""[104] Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized and partially funded the construction of fencing along the Mexican border,[105] mostly as a means to combat cross-border drug trafficking.[104] During the same campaign, Biden said that would not allow sanctuary cities to ignore federal law.[106] In 2007, Biden said that illegal immigration would not stop unless U.S. employers stopped hiring undocumented workers, saying: ""All the rest is window dressing.""[107] As vice president, Biden supported the 2013 bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, a bill crafted by the Gang of Eight (four Democratic, four Republican senators) that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants with security checks, devoted unprecedented resources to border security, created a new work visa program, and established a mandatory employment verification system to ensure that persons hired are authorized to work in the U.S. As president of the Senate, Biden personally presided over the Senate when the bill passed 68–32.[108][109] The legislation failed, however, in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.[110] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden issued his ""Biden Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants,"" in which he pledged to ""secure our border, while ensuring the dignity of migrants and upholding their legal right to seek asylum. ... enforce our laws without targeting communities, violating due process, or tearing apart families,"" ""ensure our values are squarely at the center of our immigration and enforcement policies,"" and create a ""fair and humane immigration system.""[111] Biden's proposals would undo Trump's immigration policies,[112][113] which Biden has criticized as immoral, inhumane, ineffective, economically damaging, and unconstitutional.[111] Biden said he would raise the annual ceiling for refugees from 15,000 (the historically low level set under the Trump administration) to 125,000 (higher than the Obama-era ceiling).[114] He pledged a reversal of the Trump administration's family separation policy, travel/refugee bans, and severe restrictions on asylum,[111][113] calling these policies ""cruel and senseless"" and ""un-American.""[111] If elected, he pledges to reverse Trump's public charge rule and ""so-called National Emergency,"" which diverted money from the Defense Department to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[111] Biden criticized Trump's promotion of a border wall, noting that smuggling through legal ports of entry, rather than simple illicit border-crossing, is the dominant method by which illicit drugs enter the U.S., and that ""sophisticated criminal organizations"" can easily circumvent physical barriers through ""border tunnels, semi-submersible vessels, and aerial technology.""[111] Biden has called for better security along the border and at ports of entry through technology and infrastructure (such as ""cameras, sensors, large-scale x-ray machines, and fixed towers"") as well as through improved coordination between federal agencies, as well as Mexican and Canadian authorities.[111] During his 2020 campaign, Biden proposed a ""surge"" of humanitarian resources to the border and restoration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented youth raised in the United States (the ""Dreamers"").[111] As a longer-term goal, Biden said he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.[112][113] Biden also pledged to create a program to allow U.S. military veterans deported by the Trump Administration to return to the United States.[111] He supports evidence-based alternatives to prolonged immigration detention,[111] and a ban on for-profit detention centers.[112] Biden does not support abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as some on the left-wing have called for, but said that his administration would ensure that ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers ""abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.""[112] Biden does not support the decriminalization of unauthorized border-crossing,[112] but pledged to restore ""sensible enforcement priorities"" that focus deportation and other enforcement efforts on persons convicted of serious crimes.[113][111] rather than people ""who have lived, worked, and contributed to our economy and our communities for decades.""[111] To address a backlog in the immigration courts, Biden proposed a doubling of the number of immigration judges and interpreters.[112] Biden also opposes Trump's attempts to withhold federal grant funding from sanctuary cities.[106] Regarding migrant crises, Biden's 2020 immigration policy emphasized a need to address the root causes of migration from the Central America's Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, such as endemic instability, corruption, gang violence and gender-based violence, and a lack of the rule of law. Biden pledged to update the Central American Minors Program and advance humanitarian aid, stability, and economic development in the region. He also stated that he would use the Temporary Protected Status program for persons whose countries of origin suffer from violence or unsafe conditions.[111][113] In 2006, in its Technology Issues Voter's Guide, CNET.com gave Biden a score of 37.5% on his Senate voting record.[115][116] Biden was a co-sponsor of the Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act of 2007.[117] Biden also sponsored two bills, the Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act (SB 266) and the Violent Crime Control Act (SB 618), both of which contained language seen as effectively banning encryption.[118] Crypto notes Biden wrote that language into the text of SB 266.[119] Phil Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, has said it was SB 266 that ""led [him] to publish PGP electronically for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.""[120] He later stated in a Slashdot article that he was not specifically criticizing Biden, that he would consider the Senator's ""whole body of work"" when considering whether to vote for him on the Democratic ticket in 2008 and that ""considering the disastrous erosion in our privacy and civil liberties under the (Bush) administration, I feel positively nostalgic about Biden's quaint little non-binding resolution of 1991"".[121] While in the Senate, Biden voted in 1993 for a broad defense bill that included the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law on LGBT service in the U.S. military, after voting to remove the amendment.[28][122][123] As vice president, Biden supported the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which repealed the prohibition on open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in the U.S. military.[122] In 1996, Biden voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act which prohibited the federal government from recognizing any same-sex marriage, barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law, and allowing states to do the same.[124] In the Senate, Biden was an outspoken critic of congressional Republicans' efforts in the 2000s to adopt a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage; in arguing against the proposal in 2004, Biden cited his position that same-sex marriage was an issue for states to decide.[28] During the lead up to the 2008 US presidential election he said ""In an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple"" and that they both opposed ""redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage"".[125] In a May 2012 Meet the Press interview, Vice President Biden reversed his previous position and publicly supported same-sex marriage, saying he was ""absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that.""[126] Prior to Biden's statement on Meet the Press, the Obama administration endorsed civil unions, but not same-sex marriage.[127] Biden's decision reportedly forced Obama's hand, pressuring Obama to accelerate his own public shift to support same-sex marriage.[128][129] In 2013, Section 3 of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional and partially struck down in United States v. Windsor. The Obama Administration did not defend the law and congratulated Windsor.[130] Biden supported the U.S. Supreme Court's 5–4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which held that same-sex couples have a federal constitutional right to marry. Biden issued a statement saying that the ruling reflected a principle that ""all people should be treated with respect and dignity – and that all marriages, at their root, are defined by unconditional love.""[131] In an event with the group Freedom to Marry, Biden described the decision as ""the civil rights movement of our generation"" and as consequential as Brown v. Board of Education.[132] Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential run, as did other LGBT leaders.[133] Biden supports the Equality Act, proposed federal legislation that would extend the nondiscrimination protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover discrimination ""on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.""[134] The legislation would protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination across the country in housing, public accommodations, public education, credit, and the jury system, in addition to current federal employment protections.[135] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden vowed to support legislation and action to prohibit discrimination against transgender people and to combat hate crimes targeting LGBT persons, including violence and harassment against transgender people.[136][137][138] However, his administration proposed a regulation to allow schools to bar transgender athletes from competitive teams, a decision which was strongly opposed by transgender advocates.[139][140][141][142] He has criticized Republicans, and particularly Vice President Mike Pence, for using ""religious freedom as an excuse to license discrimination.""[137][138] He supports the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a proposed anti-bullying law.[137] Biden has mentioned Catholic social teaching as an influence on his personal political beliefs.[143] At a November 2011 campaign event, in response to a question about how Biden viewed Mitt Romney's Mormon faith in November 2011, Biden said, ""I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision. It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way.""[144] Biden cited the anti-Catholic prejudice encountered by John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.[145] In 1991, Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when it held confirmation hearings on Republican President George H. W. Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. During the nomination process, Thomas was accused of a consistent pattern of sexual harassment, to which Anita Hill testified before the committee.[146] During the hearing, Biden referred to an inconclusive FBI report on the accusations by Hill as ""he said, she said.""[147] Biden refused to call other women who were willing to testify against Thomas as corroborating witnesses.[148] He voted against Thomas's confirmation both in the committee and on the Senate floor.[149] In 2017, Biden apologized to Hill over her treatment in the hearings, stating: ""Let's get something straight here, I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas... I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through. Think of the courage that it took for her to come forward.""[150] Speaking in 2018, Biden expressed regret about not being more firm in preventing Senate colleagues on the committee from engaging in what he called ""character assassination"" of Hill, saying: ""Anita Hill was vilified when she came forward, by a lot of my colleagues, I wish I could have done more to prevent those questions and the way they asked them....Under the Senate rules, I can't gavel you down and say you can't ask that question, although I tried. And so what happened was she got victimized again during the process.""[151] In 1994, Biden drafted the Violence Against Women Act; some suggest this was drafted in light of criticism Biden had received following the treatment of Anita Hill.[152] This law provided $1.6 billion to enhance investigation and prosecution of the violent crime perpetrated against women, increased pre-trial detention of the accused, provided for automatic and mandatory restitution of those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave unprosecuted. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the VAWA on Constitutional grounds in United States v. Morrison. Biden has said, ""I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate. Indeed, the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault. Our nation has been rewarded for this commitment. Since the Act's passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50%.""[153] He has also said that the Act ""empower[s] women to make changes in their lives, and by training police and prosecutors to arrest and convict abusive husbands instead of telling them to take a walk around the block"".[154] In 2017, Biden told a group of students that having sex with a woman while she is drunk is rape.[155] Biden supported the 2008 farm bill, calling it a ""responsible compromise.""[156] When he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden identified agricultural development and global food prices as major issues.[156] While in the Senate, Biden called for strong action against invasive species, citing the economic and environmental risks associated with them, including displacement of native shipping, the introduction of disease, and interference with shipping.[156] In the Senate, Biden paid particular attention to issues affecting the poultry industry, which is economically important to Delaware, especially in the Delmarva peninsula.[156] In the 1990s, Biden criticized the Russian government for threatening to ban imported U.S. chicken,[156] and in 2008 criticized the Russian government for banning imports of chicken from 19 poultry processing plants in the United States, Biden stated that ""Russia is once again using non-tariff barriers as an excuse to close its markets to American poultry. ... Russia has repeatedly shown that it is not ready to abide by the rules of international trade.""[157] Biden described the Russian action as ""part of a bigger picture in which Russia has failed to behave as a responsible member in the international community"" and called for the U.S. to block Russia's application to join the World Trade Organization.[157] Biden also worked to promote funding to research avian influenza.[156] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has outlined a rural and agricultural policy broadly similar to that of the Obama administration. The plan aims to obtain net zero emissions for agriculture (making the U.S. the first nation to do so) via incentives and permitting farmers to join carbon markets. The plan also calls for changes in trade policy to encourage U.S. agriculture exports; expansion of broadband Internet in rural areas; renewable energy investment; promotion of local and regional food; and an expansion of the USDA Conservation Stewardship Program to encourage farmers to adopt carbon sequestration and other environmental practices.[158] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies and Biden's largest contributor in the late 1990s,[51] and other credit card issuers.[159] He fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines.[159] He also worked to defeat amendments which would have protected members of the military and those who are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debt. Critics expressed concern that the law would force those seeking bankruptcy protection to hire lawyers to process the required paperwork, making it more difficult for students to execute education-related debt.[51] The overall bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton in 2000, but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting it.[159] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden moved to the left on the issue, endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy reform proposal, which would roll back many aspects of the 2005 law.[160][161][162] During and after the Obama/Biden administration, Biden strongly supported the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented new financial regulations designed to prevent a reprise of the 2008 financial crisis. The Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[163][164][165] He also supported the pro-consumer Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act.[165] Biden has been credited with introducing the first climate change bill in Congress.[166] Biden's initial bill, the Global Climate Protection Act, was introduced in 1986; it died in the Senate, but a version was included in a bill signed into law by President Reagan as an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act in December 1987.[166] In 2008, Biden was the lead sponsor of a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution calling on the U.S. to be a part of the United Nations climate change negotiations, and was a co-sponsor of the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, at the time the most stringent climate bill in the Senate. The legislation would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions and required a reduction in U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.[167] He strongly opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling,[168][169] although when he became president, he only called for a temporary moratorium instead.[170] In 2007–2008, during his presidential campaign, Biden called for a gradual increase in automobile fuel-economy standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2017,[167] called for increase production of renewable energy,[167] and identified energy security and resolving the energy crisis as key priorities.[171] In June 2019, Biden's presidential campaign unveiled a $1.7 trillion climate policy plan aiming to eliminate U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The proposal incorporated elements of the Green New Deal proposal but lacked many key aspects, such as less funding, no healthcare expansion, no guaranteed jobs or benefits, less guaranteed housing, and no bans on fracking.[172] Biden's plan would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; halt issuance of new permits for oil and gas extraction on public land and water; step up Clean Air Act enforcement; strengthen fuel economy standards to promote a shift to electric vehicles; regulate methane pollution; and create ""aggressive"" energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.[173] Biden also promised that he would re-enter the Paris Agreement (from which Trump pulled the U.S.) on his first day in the White House and called for ""a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries' climate targets.""[173] To pressure countries failing to meet their climate obligations, Biden also called for ""carbon adjustment fees"" to be levied on goods imported from countries that failed to meet emissions targets.[173] The plan also won considerable support from the fossil fuel industry.[174] Biden's Green New Deal plan is incorporated in his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, which would in part lead to the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps.[175] In November 2021, Biden promised to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030,[176] in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.[177][178] A week after the November closing of COP26 the Biden administration held the largest federal gas and oil lease auction in U.S. history, selling 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The areas can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. In January 2021, the administration put a pause on new federal gas and oil leasing but was sued to open them for sale by several Republican-led states. When a federal judge sided with the states Biden appealed the decision but agreed to continue with the sales. The administration has also proposed another round of gas and oil lease sales in 2022, in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states.[179][180] In 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which represents the largest investment into addressing climate change in United States history.[181] During the Obama administration, Biden was the lead figure promoting the administration's proposal to spend $53 billion over six years toward construction of a national intercity high-speed rail network, in furtherance of Obama's goal (outlined in the 2011 State of the Union Address) to extend high-speed rail access to 80% of the American population over a quarter-century.[182][183][184] Republicans in Congress rejected the proposal, which did not advance.[185][186] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden released a $1.3 trillion infrastructure improvement plan, which would follow up on Obama administration priorities.[187] The plan calls for $50 billion investment in repairs to existing roads and bridges in his first year in office; $10 billion over a decade to transit construction in high-poverty parts of the U.S.; doubling funding for BUILD and INFRA grants, and more funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.[187] The plan also includes proposals for investments in high-speed rail, public transit, and bicycling,[186] as well as school construction, replacement of water pipes and other water infrastructure, and expansion of rural broadband.[188] The plan also specifically calls for the rebuilding of the Hudson River Tunnel and the expansion of the Northeast Corridor, as well as rail investments in California and the Midwest and West.[186] Biden proposed funding the plan through tax increases on high-income Americans and corporations; the campaign stated that ""reversing the excesses of the Trump tax cuts for corporations; reducing incentives for tax havens, evasion, and outsourcing; ensuring corporations pay their fair share; closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward wealth, not work; and ending subsidies for fossil fuels"" would provide the revenue for the plan, making it deficit-neutral.[188] A long-term rider and advocate of Amtrak, during his 2020 campaign, Biden said that, if elected, his administration would ""spark the second great railroad revolution"" and move to electrify Amtrak trains.[189] He also voiced support for 2,000 Amtrak workers furloughed due to Trump administration budget cuts, although he did not take a specific position on Amtrak personnel and service reductions.[189] In the Senate, Biden consistently supported ""a U.S.-led, rules-based international order with an emphasis on reducing trade barriers and setting global trade standards.""[190] He had a mixed record on specific free trade agreements;[191][192] he voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, and Morocco–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, but voted against free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Oman, and the Dominican Republic and Central America (CAFTA), viewing their labor and environmental protections as insufficient.[191][192] He voted in favor of fast track trade promotion authority in 1998 and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000.[191][192] During the Obama administration, Biden was a strong advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership,[193] arguing that the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP ""put China in the driver's seat"" by allowing it to ""write the rules of the road for the world"" in the absence of U.S. participation.[192] Biden has been critical of Chinese trade tactics, including ""dumping"" of steel and Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property.[192] He believes the US, rather than China, should write the rules that govern trade, in which ""workers, the environment, transparency, and middle-class wages"" are protected.[194] He has criticized the Trump trade war with China for failing to ""resolve the issues at the heart of the dispute"";[192] for the trade war's negative effect on U.S. agriculture and manufacturing;[192][195] and for Trump's unilateral approach.[190] Biden also criticized Trump for labeling Canada and the European Union as ""national security threats,""[192] arguing that this undercuts multilateral efforts with allies to combat Chinese trade abuses.[192][190] He supports pressuring China on environmental issues and supports the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.[192] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Obama administration's signature health care reform legislation.[196][197] He has condemned the Trump administration's attempts to strike down the ACA in court,[196] including in California v. Texas.[198] Biden supports the ACA's protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions as well as the ACA's minimum standards for health insurance plans; he has pledged to preserve these protections.[199] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has promoted a plan to expand and build upon the ACA, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[196] Biden's plan is to create a public option for health insurance, with the aim of expanding health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans.[196] He does not support single-payer health care proposals such as Medicare for All.[200] Under Biden's proposal, ""no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums.""[201] Under Biden's plan, all those on the individual insurance market would qualify for tax credits on premiums (a change from existing law, which caps premium tax credits at four times the federal poverty level, or under $50,000 for an independent). To reduce prescription drug prices, Biden proposes allowing import of prescription drugs and authorizing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices.[196] In April 2020, Biden proposed lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60.[22][199] Biden supports an end to surprise billing.[199] Biden was given an 85% lifetime approval rating from AFL–CIO.[203] and was a cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act.[204] As stated during his 2020 presidential campaign, the Biden administration intended to fight laws ""that exist only to deprive unions of the financial support they need to fight for higher wages and better benefits""[205] and sought to end or curtail the enforcement of the so-called 2020 Trump Rule which was the Department of Labor's (DOL) heightened oversight of union financial disclosure requirements.[206] The so-called ""Trump Rule"" still exists, the Biden administration announced on March 29 that it will not be enforcing the heightened union reporting requirements to the DOL concerning strike funds, apprenticeship programs, and other union-related “trust fund” information.[207] While he describes himself as pro-labor, Biden has also supported legislation that would impose unpopular contracts on workers, forcing them to work without sick leave and using the Railway Labor Act to prevent workers from striking.[208][209] Worker unions have voted against the proposal, citing quality of life concerns.[210] In particular, it would penalize employees for medical visits, a policy that has been blamed for worker deaths and was a major issue during the COVID-19 pandemic.[211][212] Railroad companies have seen sizeable profits under this policy and have been unwilling to negotiate, praising Biden for his proposed government intervention, which would compel workers to accept their terms.[210][213][214] Biden opposed the George W. Bush administration's tax cuts enacted mostly in 2001 and 2003, noting that most of the benefits of the tax cuts went to the very wealthiest U.S. families, and arguing that the cuts did not help working-class and middle-class Americans.[215] The Obama/Biden administration advocated keeping the cuts in place for 98% of U.S. taxpayers but letting them expire on income over $250,000 earned by couples (or income over $200,000 for individuals).[215] After the Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 election, Biden was designated as the administration's chief negotiator with congressional Republicans—specifically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—regarding the Bush tax cuts, which were about to expire.[216] The administration opposed extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy but also did not want to trigger tax increases for non-wealthy Americans when the economy was continuing to recover from the Great Recession.[216] The result was a deal: ""Biden and McConnell hashed out a deal that extended all the Bush tax cuts until after the 2012 election, while injecting another $300 billion as an economic stimulus, including a new payroll tax cut for workers, extended unemployment benefits for victims of the recession and expanded tax credits for college students and the poor. By reopening the Senate, the deal also enabled the historic vote to repeal the ban on gay people in the military.""[216] Biden opposes privatizing or means-testing of Social Security.[217] He was given an 89% approval rating from the Alliance for Retired Americans (ARA), reflecting a pro-senior citizen voting record.[218] Biden has called for an expansion of Social Security, including by increasing payments to the oldest Americans (persons who have been receiving retirement benefits for at least 20 years); setting a minimum guaranteed benefit (equal to at least 125% of the federal poverty level) for all Americans with at least 30 years of work; and increasing monthly survivor benefits for widows and widowers by about 20%.[217] Biden has proposed to fund the expansion, and to make the Social Security Trust Fund solvent over the long-term, through tax increases on the highest income-earners.[217] Biden has condemned Trump for waging ""a reckless war on Social Security"" by signing an executive order in 2020 that deferred the collection of the payroll tax that funds Social Security, and for Trump's comments suggesting that he might seek to forgo the tax.[219] Biden said that Trump's move will ""undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.""[219] Biden voted for the 1996 bipartisan welfare reform compromise legislation.[220] Biden pledged a large federal government response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic akin to the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt following the Great Depression.[221] This would include increased COVID-19 testing, ensuring a steady supply of personal protective equipment, distributing a vaccine once available, and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national ""supply chain commander"" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits, distributed by a ""Pandemic Testing Board"" (similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board).[221] Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a ""public health jobs corps"" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks.[221] Biden has said that ""The United States will always reserve the right to defend itself and its allies, by force, if necessary. But force must be used judiciously to protect a vital interest of the United States, only when the objective is clear and achievable, with the informed consent of the American people, and where required, the approval of Congress.""[222] He has emphasized ""returning the United States to its traditional role as the leader of a world order based on promotion of democracy, multilateralism, alliance-building and diplomatic engagement""[223] and pledged in 2020 that if elected, he would reinvigorate the U.S.'s traditional alliances, including with countries alienated by Trump, and would convene a summit of major heads of state.[224] Biden opposes military action aimed at regime change, but has said that ""it is appropriate for us to provide nonmilitary support for opposition movements seeking universal human rights and more representative and accountable governance.""[222] With respect to humanitarian intervention, Biden has said the U.S. has ""a moral duty, as well as a security interest, to respond to genocide or chemical weapons use"" but that such cases ""require action by the community of nations, not just the United States.""[222] Biden has said that he plans to restore U.S. membership in key United Nations bodies, such as UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),[224] the World Health Organization,[225] and possibly the Human Rights Council.[224] Biden opposed U.S. government funding of abstinence-only sex education programs in Africa, and in 2007, cosponsored the HIV Prevention Act which would end President George W. Bush's mandate that one-third of all funds be earmarked to abstinence-only programs.[226] Biden favors greater U.S. engagement with Africa to counter growing Chinese influence on the continent.[224] In 2011, during the Obama administration's internal debate on the Libyan Civil War, Biden opposed the U.S. intervention.[227][228] Biden stated he was ""strongly against going to Libya"" due to the instability it would cause after Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, recounting to Charlie Rose later: ""My question was, 'OK, tell me what happens.' He's gone. What happens? Doesn't the country disintegrate? What happens then? Doesn't it become a place where it becomes a petri dish for the growth of extremism? And it has.""[229] Biden publicly defended the Obama administration's ultimate decision to participate in the Libya intervention, saying in 2011, ""NATO got it right. In this case, America spent $2 billion and didn't lose a single life. This is more the prescription for how to deal with the world as we go forward than it has in the past.""[230] Biden favored an American deployment of troops to Darfur during the war in Darfur, saying that 2,500 U.S. troops could stop the violence in the region.[226] As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has been a prominent voice calling for ""hard-headed diplomacy"" with Iran. He also has called for the implementation of ""coordinated international sanctions"" on Iran, adding ""we should complement this pressure by presenting a detailed, positive vision for U.S.–Iran relations if Iran does the right thing.""[226] In 2007, Biden voted against a measure to declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. He wrote in December 2007 that ""War with Iran is not just a bad option. It would be a disaster."" Biden threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Bush if he had started a war with Iran without Congressional approval.[226] In an interview in September 2008, Biden stated that the IRGC was a terrorist organization and that the Bush administration already had the power to designate it as one. He stated that he voted against the measure out of concern that the Bush administration would misuse the measure to justify a military attack against Iran.[231] As vice president, Biden vigorously defended the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration between Iran and the U.S. and other global powers.[232] Biden has criticized Trump's withdrawal from the agreement and the Trump administration's Iran strategy as ""a self-inflicted disaster,"" saying in 2019 that Iran had ""only gotten more aggressive"" since Trump ""unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated.""[233] Biden said, ""I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They've ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them, and a self-defeating way. Trump's approach is demonstrably the latter. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy – clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship.""[234] If elected president, Biden said he would reenter and strengthen the nuclear agreement once Iran is in compliance.[235] In 1990, after Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Biden voted against the first Gulf War, asking: ""What vital interests of the United States justify sending Americans to their deaths in the sands of Saudi Arabia?""[236] In 1998, Biden expressed support for the use of force against Iraq and urged a sustained effort to ""dethrone"" Hussein over the long haul.[237] In 2002, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he stated that Hussein was ""a long-term threat and a short term threat to our national security"" and that ""We have no choice but to eliminate the threat. This is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world. He must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power.""[238] Biden also supported a failed resolution authorizing military action in Iraq only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts.[239] Biden subsequently voted in favor of the 2002 resolution that authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying, ""I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations. Because while Iraq's illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not – do not – pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.""[240] During the Iraq War, Biden consistently criticized the George W. Bush administration for ""its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq.""[240] He criticized Bush in March and April 2003 for failing to make robust diplomatic efforts to avert war but said at the time that it was ""the right decision"" to ""separate him (Hussein) from his weapons and/or separate him from power.""[240] In an interview of Meet the Press in November 2005, Biden said of his 2002 vote to authorize the use of force: ""It was a mistake. It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. ... We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.""[240] In 2007, Biden strongly opposed Bush's ""troop surge"" in Iraq, calling it a ""tragic mistake.""[241] He promoted legislation to repeal and replace the 2002 resolution that authorized the war, arguing that it was no longer necessary because Hussein had been removed for power and executed, and because no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in Iraq.[241] The replacement resolution favored by Biden would provide that U.S. troops could combat terrorism and train Iraqi forces, but begin a ""responsible drawdown"" of U.S. troops that would end in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.[241] In May 2006, in an op-ed in The New York Times, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, proposed a plan for a decentralized, federal Iraq, with a relatively weak central government with strong Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish regional administrations that would govern largely autonomously within their own regions.[241][242][243][244] Under the plan, there would not have been a partition of the country,[243] but the central government would have its responsibilities limited to areas of common concern, such as ""border defense, foreign policy, and oil production and revenue sharing.""[242] The goal of the plan was to halt the high level of sectarian violence in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.[241][242][243] Biden likened the plan to the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which led to an end to the Bosnian War.[242][244] The plan received a mixed reception.[242] A non-binding ""sense of the Senate"" resolution in support of the plan, sponsored by Biden and Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas), passed the Senate in a September 2007 on a 75–23 vote.[242][243] However, the proposal was opposed by Bush administration and many Iraqi political parties, including the United Iraqi Alliance of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.[242] The autonomy/federalism proposal was broadly unpopular among Iraqi Arabs, both Sunni and Shia,[245][242][246] but was welcomed by Iraqi Kurds and the Kurdistan Regional Government,[245] as well as by Iraq President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd and proponent of Iraqi federalism.[242] In a 2016 interview with Council on Foreign Relations president Richard N. Haass, Biden spoke about changing ""the fundamental approach [America] had to the Middle East"", and that the lesson learned from Iraq is ""the use of force with large standing armies in place was extremely costly, [and] would work until the moment we left.""[247] In the Senate, Biden developed lifelong relationships with Israeli officials through his work on the Foreign Relations Committee,[248] beginning with Golda Meir in 1973.[249][248][250] Biden called his meeting with Meir as a young senator on the eve of the Yom Kippur War ""one of the most consequential meetings I've ever had in my life.""[251] He has regularly described himself as a Zionist,[226][249] and is a longtime supporter of Israel, which Biden considers to be a key U.S. strategic ally in the Middle East.[249][252] On the Senate floor in 1986 he defended US funding of Israel referring to it as ""the best $3 billion investment we make"" and declared that ""were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region"".[253][254] When Biden was selected by Obama as a running mate, National Jewish Democratic Council chairman Ira Forman praised the choice, saying, ""There is no one you could possibly pick who knows the issues, who is committed to Israel's security and knows Israeli leaders, as much as Joe Biden.""[255] During the 2008 presidential campaign, Biden stressed in a Florida campaign event that he and his running mate Obama were both strongly pro-Israel and would make Israel more secure.[250][256][257] Biden also said: ""A strong America is a strong Israel. I have a 35-year record of supporting Israel, and Israel's security is enhanced the stronger America is.""[258] In the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated ""no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden. I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion.""[259] In 2008, Biden criticized the George W. Bush administration and John McCain, arguing: ""By any empirical standard, Israel is less secure today than it was when George Bush became president. He has made one foul-up after another that John has supported.""[250][256] Biden called for a proactive US role in the Israel-Palestinian peace process,[252] which he argued would be advanced if the U.S. took steps to ""regain the respect of the world.""[258] He called for increased engagement with Syria over the Golan Heights dispute, the disarmament of Hezbollah, and Syrian influence in Lebanon.[252] In 2008, discussing the possibility of Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Biden said it was ""not a question for us to tell the Israelis what they can and cannot do"" but that he had ""faith in the democracy of Israel"" and supported additional diplomatic efforts to avert military conflict.[231] In April 2009, Biden again said that Israel would not launch a unilateral strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, stating: ""I think [Israel] would be ill-advised to do that. And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago.""[260] Throughout his career, Biden has had a strong relationship with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), speaking at the group's events and fundraisers;[251] Biden and AIPAC have mutually praised each other.[261] Nevertheless, Biden has not always agreed with the group's stances, saying in 2008 that ""AIPAC does not speak for the entire American Jewish community. There's other organizations as strong and as consequential"" and adding ""I've never disagreed with AIPAC on the objective. Whenever I've had disagreement with AIPAC it has always been a tactical disagreement, not a substantive disagreement.""[262] Biden strongly opposed granting executive clemency to Jonathan Pollard, who was convicted of spying for Israel, saying ""If it were up to me, he would stay in jail for life.""[248][263] Biden praised the United Arab Emirates's offer to recognize Israel in a August 2020 normalization agreement, calling the agreement ""a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship.""[264][265] In an effort to reduce the rise of Anti Semitism in the United States, the Biden administration launched[266] the first ever national strategy to combat Anti Semitism on May 25, 2023. Biden has consistently supported a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying it is (1) ""the only path to long-term security for Israel, while sustaining its identity as a Jewish and democratic state""; (2) ""the only way to ensure Palestinian dignity and their legitimate interest in national self-determination""; and (3) ""a necessary condition to take full advantage of the opening that exists for greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.""[251] He cosponsored the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 which expressed U.S. support for a two-state solution.[226][267] In a 2007 interview, when asked about the failure to achieve Israeli-Palestinians peace, Biden stated that ""Israel's a democracy and they make mistakes. But the notion that somehow if Israel just did the right thing, [the peace process] would work ... give me a break."" He also stated that ""The responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist, will not play fair, will not deal, will not renounce terror.""[255] During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated that the Bush administration's policy concerning the Middle East had been ""an abject failure"" and pledged that, if elected, he and Barack Obama would ""change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.""[259] In a 2010 speech to the Jewish Federations of North America, Biden said ""There is no substitute for direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured – the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli people's decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for nationhood.""[268] Speaking in 2019, Biden said, ""At the present, neither the Israeli nor Palestinian leadership seems willing to take the political risks necessary to make progress through direct negotiations,"" and said that if elected president, he would be focusing on urging ""both sides to take steps to keep the prospect of a two-state outcome alive.""[251] Following Trump's controversial move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Biden said he would not return the embassy to Tel Aviv if elected president, but that he would re-open the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem for outreach to Palestinians.[251] Biden reaffirmed his support for a two-state solution during his presidency, noting it in an April 2021 telephone call with King Abdullah II of Jordan.[269] Biden has consistently criticized Israeli settlement policy.[251] In a 2009 speech at the AIPAC conference, Biden called upon Israel ""to work towards a two-state solution"" by dismantling existing Israeli settlements, halting new settlement construction, and allowing Palestinians freedom of movement, and called on the Palestinians to ""combat terror and incitement against Israel.""[270] In a 2016 speech to J Street, Biden said that he had ""overwhelming frustration"" with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the government's promotion and expansion of settlements, legalization of outposts, and land seizures. Noting that he had opposed Israeli settlements for more than three decades, Biden said they are counterproductive to Israel's security. In the same speech, Biden criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks and Palestinian recourse to the International Criminal Court, which he called ""damaging moves that only take us further from the path toward peace,"" and called out President Mahmoud Abbas for failing to condemn terrorist attacks. Regarding a multi-billion dollar defense deal that the U.S. was negotiating with Israel, Biden said ""Israel will not get everything it asks for, but it will get every single solitary thing it needs,"" and said: ""No matter what political disagreements we have with Israel – and we do have political disagreements now – there is never any question about our commitment to Israel's security.""[271][272] In a subsequent speech in December 2019, Biden criticized Netanyahu for his drift to ""the extreme right in his party,"" calling this move a bid to retain political power and a ""serious mistake.""[273] Biden criticized Israel's plan to annex parts of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.[274] In June 2020, Biden's foreign policy advisor Tony Blinken said that Biden ""would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree."" Biden said that if elected president he will firmly reject the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign ""which singles out Israel and too often veers into antisemitism – and fight other efforts to delegitimize Israel on the global stage.""[275] Biden has called Saudi Arabia a pariah state.[276][277] Biden criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen,[195] accusing Saudi Arabia of killing ""innocent people"" in that war.[276] He said that if elected president, he would end US involvement in that war and re-assess Saudi Arabia-United States relations. He criticized the Trump administration's sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.[195] Saudi Arabia reportedly took more than 24 hours to congratulate Joe Biden on his November 3, 2020, Presidential election victory. Biden demanded more accountability over Jamal Khashoggi's murder from Saudi Arabia during his campaigns. The elections saw the defeat of Donald Trump who had close personal ties with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.[278] In a 2018 conversation for Foreign Affairs, Biden described Syria as ""a classic example of the biggest conundrum that we have to deal with."" He sees America's current situation in Syria as having ""lost the notion among our European friends that we know what we're doing, that we have a plan."" He emphasized the necessity of stabilizing Syria, especially in major cities like Raqqa.[279] Raqqa is in ruins after lengthy battles between ISIL and Kurdish forces, the SDF, with assistance from the U.S.-led coalition.[280] Biden said a multi-billion dollar investment is required to rebuild the city. He believes Iran, not Russia, will be the biggest beneficiaries in the short term if Syria remains a battlefield. President Bashar al-Assad will also need to be removed from power, otherwise Syria will never have peace or security.[279] Biden said there is no uniting principle in Syria, unlike Iraq, hence only certain safe harbors can be established in the region to reduce the number of displaced people and deaths.[279] In 2014, Biden said that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had ""poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al-Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.""[281] Shortly afterward, Biden later apologized to the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over comments that Turkey supported jihadist rebels in Syria.[282] However, Biden has remained strongly critical of Erdoğan; in December 2019, Biden referred to Erdoğan as an ""autocrat"" and criticized his treatment of the Kurds in Turkey, Turkish military links with Russia (including Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense equipment), and the Turkish government's threats to limit access to U.S. airfields in Turkey.[283][284] Biden has long been a supporter of the rights of the Kurds.[245][285] In 2020, Biden told Kurdistan 24, ""Masoud Barzani is a good friend of mine, and I wished we could have done more for the Kurds."" When asked why he could not, Biden said: ""Turkey.""[245] Biden has criticized the Kurdish separatist organization PKK; in 2016, he said the PKK was a terrorist group ""plain and simple"" and compared it to ISIL.[286] Also in 2016, Biden warned Kurds against seeking a separate state on the Turkish-Syrian border.[287] In 2016, Biden condemned the coup attempt in Turkey,[287] but also criticized the Turkish government's subsequent campaign of repression against journalists, political dissidents, and academics, and violations of freedom of speech.[288][289] Biden also rebuffed attempts by Erdoğan and the Turkish government to pressure the U.S. to extradite dissident cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey, noting that under U.S. law, the matter was for the legal system and federal courts to decide, and the Obama administration had no proper role. (The Turkish government has clashed with Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt; Gulen denies the allegation).[290][291][292] In September 2020, Biden demanded that Turkey ""stay out"" of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in which Turkey has supported the Azeris.[293][294] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, ""Whatever it takes, we should do it.""[295] In 2008, Pakistan awarded the Hilal-e-Pakistan (Crescent of Pakistan) to Joe Biden and Senator Richard Lugar ""in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan"".[296] This was after Biden passed a bill authorizing $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.[297] In a 2008 interview, Biden criticized Bush for presenting Iraq as the primary front against terrorism, saying the U.S. should ""urgently shift our focus"" from Iraq to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, which Biden described as ""the real central front on the so-called war on terrorism,"" noting that ""The Afghanistan-Pakistan border is where the 9/11 attacks were plotted... It's where most attacks on Europe since 9/11 have originated. It's where Osama bin Laden lives and his top confederates still enjoy safe haven, planning new attacks.[298] Biden said that ""the outcome of that battle is going to be determined less by bullets than by dollars and determination"" and that the U.S.'s ""original sin was starting a war of choice [the intervention in Iraq] before we finished a war of necessity [the war in Afghanistan].""[298] During the Obama administration's internal debates, Biden argued strongly against the 2009 surge of troops to Afghanistan, putting him on the opposite side of Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[228][299] Biden argued that rampant corruption and ineffectiveness in the Afghan government, military, and police made the U.S. strategy unworkable, and was ""agnostic"" about the survival of the Kabul-based government.[299] In 2012, speaking to West Point graduates, Biden argued that the Obama administration's drawdown of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq allowed the U.S. ""enabled us to replace and rebalance our foreign policy"" to focus on other challenges.[300] In 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden pledges to bring home the remaining U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan during his first term in office, and that ""any residual U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be focused only on counterterrorism operations.""[301] With respect to Asia, Biden favors restoring the ""traditional U.S. stance supporting the presence of American troops in Japan and South Korea.""[224] In 2016, Biden described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as an agreement that was as much about geopolitics as economics. Being part of the Obama administration, he supported the agreement in an attempt to ""rebalance towards Asia"" against a stronger and bolder Chinese foreign policy in the region.[247] Biden first visited China in April 1979, where met with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on the first U.S. congressional delegation to China since the 1949 revolution.[302] In 2000, he voted in favor of normalizing trade relations with China and supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[302] Over the years, Biden has frequently criticized the Chinese government for its human rights abuses, while also acknowledging the need to gain Chinese cooperation on issues such as climate change, Iran and North Korea.[302] Biden was outraged by the Chinese government's violent repression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and in the Senate introduced legislation to create the democracy-promoting Radio Free Asia, which opened in 1996 and continues to operate.[302] In June 2019, Biden wrote, ""China's continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can't be ignored.""[195] Biden termed the Chinese actions against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province a genocide.[302] Also in 2020, Biden expressed support for Hong Kong's protests.[303] In 2018, Biden said he had spent more time in private meetings with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping than any other world leader.[279] He has criticized Xi as ""a guy who doesn't have a democratic – with a small d – bone in his body. This is a guy who is a thug.""[304][305] Biden pledged, if elected, to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[302] In 2019, Biden said that China is ""not competition"" for the United States, drawing criticism from prominent members of both parties.[306] In 2021, Biden called China America's ""most serious competitor"".[307] On February 10, Biden spoke to Xi for the first time after taking office as U.S. president and told a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, ""If we don't get moving, they are going to eat our lunch.""[308] Biden was accused of giving a ""shameful"" answer when asked about Uyghur genocide in a CNN town hall in 2021, claiming it was a result of ""different cultural norms"".[309] Speaking in 2006, Biden described North Korea as a ""paper tiger"" that lacked the capacity to directly cause harm to America, but condemned North Korean nuclear testing as a ""deliberate and dangerous provocation.""[226] He proposed a requirement, included in the 2007 national defense authorization act, for the Bush administration to appoint a special coordinator on North Korea, and described Korean Peninsula tensions as one of ""the three most important things that the next president is going to have to deal with"" (along with policy on Iraq and Iran).[226] As vice president, Biden visited South Korean President Park Geun-hye and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In a 2013 speech in Seoul, Biden said: ""The United States and the world have to make it absolutely clear to Kim Jong-un that the international community will not accept or tolerate nuclear arms in North Korea. The simple fact is this—North Korea can never achieve security and prosperity so long as it pursues nuclear weapons, period. We are prepared to go back to the six-party talks when North Korea demonstrates its full commitment to a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.""[310] Biden has criticized Trump's warm personal relations with Kim as ""antithetical to who we are,"" saying, ""Are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Kim Jong-un?""[311] Biden also criticized Trump for engaging in ""three made-for-TV summits"" that have led to no ""concrete commitment from North Korea.""[312] Biden has pledged, if elected president, to discontinue Trump's direct personal diplomacy with Kim[313] and engage in a ""sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others"" to pressure North Korea toward denuclearization.""[312] North Korean state media attacked Biden in 2019 as ""an imbecile""; a spokesman for Biden's campaign responded: ""Trump has also been repeatedly tricked into making major concessions to the murderous regime in Pyongyang while getting nothing in return. Given Vice President Biden's record of standing up for American values and interests, it's no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House.""[311] In May 2021, President Biden expressed his and South Korea's commitment to ""the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula...[and addressing North Korea's] nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""[314] In the 1990s, Biden was involved in efforts to stop the Bosnian genocide by Bosnian Serb forces.[315] He supported the ""lift and strike"" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.[316][317] Biden supported sending in the American airforce to blow up ""all of the bridges on the Drina"" and to take out their oil supplies.[318] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.[319] During the Kosovo War (1999), Biden supported US military intervention against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).[316] He was strongly critical of Serbia, saying that Serbs are ""illiterates, degenerates, baby killers and rapists"".[320] He co-sponsored a resolution with John McCain for use of force by the US to halt Yugoslav military actions toward Kosovo Albanians.[315][319][321] Biden has pressed Serbia over the issue of missing persons and war crimes.[315] He supports the independence of Kosovo and considers it ""irreversible"".[322] In 2010 he referred to the Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Thaci as ""the George Washington of Kosovo"".[323] According to Biden, he was one of ""only three people in Washington"" who thought that the US troops ""should go straight to Belgrade and arrest Milosevic"" even at the cost of American lives:[324] ""We should announce there's going to be American casualties. We should go to Belgrade, and we should have a Japanese-German style occupation of that country."" In his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden supports an agreement of mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia, and for Kosovo to attain EU visa liberalisation.[315] He also supports Albania's territorial security and its reform agenda aimed toward becoming a future EU member.[315] Biden supports Bosnian territorial integrity and sovereignty, its multi-ethnic society and future membership in NATO and the EU.[315] During his campaign for the presidency, Biden has called for restoring friendly U.S. relationship with fellow NATO member states, which have been strained by insults and antagonism from Trump,[224] as well as by criticism by Trump of NATO and other multilateral alliances.[325] Biden criticized Trump's decision to withdraw 9,500 U.S. troops stationed in Germany.[326] Biden has criticized Trump for treating NATO as ""a protection racket"" rather than ""the most significant military alliance in the history of the world"" and Biden advisors have identified a strengthened NATO as a key component of countering a rising China.[326] According to European diplomats and trade experts, a Biden presidency would likely lead to a boost in the U.S.-British ""special relationship""; repair alliances broken during the Trump administration; and enhance the likelihood of a trans-Atlantic trade agreement.[325] Biden is a staunch supporter of the European Union (EU).[327] Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election caused consternation among some in the unionist community due to comments made in the past indicating apparent sympathies to Irish republicanism.[328] DUP representatives in particular criticized a joking comments made by Vice-President Biden on St Patrick's Day 2015 to the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny; ""anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here"".[328][329][330] The color orange in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is associated with the Orange Order and Protestantism more generally.[329][330] Regarding Brexit, Biden in 2020 warned the British government not to jeopardize peace in Northern Ireland by negating the rules and regulations of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and has said that ""Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.[331][332] Speaking in 2020, former U.S. Ambassador to the EU Anthony L. Gardner said that ""Joe Biden believes that the triangle of relationships, US–UK, UK–EU, US and EU, all have to work together, and you will see statements to that effect.""[332] Biden condemned ""LGBT-free zones"" in Poland, saying they ""have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world.""[333] In 1999, Biden cosponsored a draft resolution condemning Russia's military campaign to crush the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the use of indiscriminate force by the Russian army against civilians and violations of the Geneva Convention, and urged a peaceful resolution of the conflict.[334][335] In 2005, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution criticizing Russia for failing to uphold its commitments at the 1999 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Summit, which included agreements on a completed Russian military withdrawal from Moldova's breakaway, pro-Russian region of Transnistria. That resolution also expressed disapproval of Russia's demand for the closure of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), which served to observe border crossings between Georgia and the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia. That bill passed in the Senate.[226] Biden introduced legislation in July 2008 urging members of the Group of Eight to ""work toward a more constructive relationship with Russia"", and encouraging Russia to behave according to the G-8's ""objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, and democracy."" The resolution also called on Russian and U.S. leaders to increase cooperation and funding for the Nunn-Lugar program and other nonproliferation initiatives. It also emphasized the need for a successor to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty. The resolution passed.[226] Biden has voiced concerns about Russia backsliding on democratic reforms. In August 2008, Biden criticized Russia's military action in Georgia in support of South Ossetian separatists. ""By acting disproportionately with a full-scale attack on Georgia and seeking the ouster of Georgia's democratically elected President Mikheil Saakashvili, Moscow is jeopardizing its standing in Europe and the broader international community – and risking very real practical and political consequences"", Biden wrote in a Financial Times op-ed. Biden urged Russia to abide by the negotiated cease-fire.[226] Through 2020, Biden and Putin had met once, in Moscow in March 2011. After an official group meeting Biden characterized in his memoir as ""argumentative,"" he and Putin met privately, with Biden saying ""Mr. Prime Minister, I'm looking into your eyes,"" (a reference to a 2001 meeting between Putin and President Bush, who later said ""I looked the man in the eye...I was able to get a sense of his soul""). Biden continued, ""I don't think you have a soul."" Putin replied, ""We understand each other.""[336] In a 2018 Foreign Affairs op-ed co-written with Michael Carpenter, Biden described Russia as a kleptocratic, nationalist-populist state that considers Western democracy its existential threat. He acknowledged that the Kremlin launched coordinated attacks across many domains – military, political, economic, informational – against various Western democratic countries, including cyberattacks on the 2016 United States presidential election and 2017 French presidential election. As a result of Russia's threat, Biden supports a ""strong response"" with cooperation from America's allies and campaign finance reform that will prohibit foreign donations from flowing into domestic elections.[337] Blockquote|text=Western democracies must also address glaring vulnerabilities in their electoral systems, financial sectors, cyber-infrastructure, and media ecosystems. The U.S. campaign finance system, for example, needs to be reformed to deny foreign actors – from Russia and elsewhere – the ability to interfere in American elections. Authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the secretive bundling of donations that allows foreign money to flow to U.S. organizations (such as “ghost corporations”) that in turn contribute to super PACs and other putatively independent political organizations, such as trade associations and so-called 501(c)(4) groups. Congress must get serious about campaign finance reform now; doing so should be a matter of bipartisan consensus since this vulnerability affects Democrats and Republicans in equal measure.|sign=Joe Biden, Michael Carpenter|source=""How to Stand Up to the Kremlin"" He also condemned Trump for equivocating ""on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election, even after he received briefings from top intelligence officials on precisely how Moscow did it.""[338] At the 2019 Munich Security Conference, Biden reiterated his opposition to Russian interference in elections and their actions against European neighbors, saying, ""We have to be explicit in our response and make clear to Russia that there's a price to pay for these transgressions of international norms"", and that the U.S. needs to continue to support its NATO allies, as well as Georgia and Ukraine who are not part of NATO, by ""establishing virtually continuous air, land and sea presence on NATO's eastern perimeter."" He also expressed concerns about Russian influence operations targeting American politics.[339] On 19 January 2022, President Biden said that he believed Russia would invade Ukraine.[340] Biden said a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be ""the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace"" since World War Two.[341] In January 2022, the Biden administration approved deliveries of U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.[342] President Biden was considering deploying up to 50,000 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe.[343] White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said that ""President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February [2022]""[344] Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disagreed on how imminent the threat was.[345][346] After Russia invaded Ukraine he imposed sanctions on Russia and authorized foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.[347][348] As part of the Obama Administration, Biden supported the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to combat drug cartels and strengthen law enforcement in Central America. Between 2008 and 2011, the Department of State provided $361.5 million to Central American countries. The State Department stated five main goals to CARSI: When Biden met with Central American leaders in Honduras in 2012, he reiterated the Obama Administration's pledge of $107 million in aid for the region. The Administration would work with Congress to provide the funds under CARSI. These initiatives were part of a larger effort for institutional reform in the region to counter drug trafficking.[350][351] During the 2014 Central American child-migrant crisis, Biden supported a $1 billion economic aid package to affected Central American countries. In an op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote, ""the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.""[352] He also supported further institutional reforms to combat corruption in those countries, so they can provide their people with safer living conditions.[353] While in the Senate, Biden voted for the Helms-Burton Act and supported the U.S. embargo against Cuba; in 2006, Biden called for the U.S. to be ""putting together a plan as to how we are going to play a positive role in moving that country, after the Castros are gone ... more toward democratization and liberalization.""[226][354] As vice president, Biden supported Obama's Cuban thaw and reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.[355] Biden stated that the lifting of U.S. trade and travel restrictions removed an ""ineffective stumbling block to our bilateral relations with other nations in the hemisphere"" and made it easier for the U.S. to engage on issues around human rights.[355] Biden has criticized Trump's moves to roll back the détente between the U.S. and Cuba, writing in an op-ed in Americas Quarterly that Trump's resumptions of restrictions on travel and commerce harm Cubans seeking ""greater independence from the Communist state"" and alienate Western Hemisphere allies.[356] Biden also wrote in the Miami Herald that ""Trump's...callously limiting the ability of Cuban Americans to reunite with and support their families in Cuba, and the administration's Latin America policy, at best, is a Cold War-era retread and, at worst, at worst, an ineffective mess.""[357] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to restore Obama-era U.S. relations with Cuba.[224][358] Asked about the 2021 Cuban protests, Biden criticized the ""failed state"" of Cuba for repressing its citizens and referred to communism, which Cuba follows, as ""a universally failed system."" The President also described socialism as ""not a very good substitute.""[359][360][361]  ",en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden,
,,2024 primary elections: the GOP and Democratic races to watch in Texas,"Primary elections for both Republicans and Democrats are shaping up to give voters a chance to weigh in on major schisms between party factions in Texas. On the Republican side, many differences of opinion rest on the policies and approach of former President Donald Trump. For Democrats, candidates with progressive ideas are facing off against those who lean moderate, and say they’re interested in working on a bipartisan basis in Washington. Alexandra Samuels, a senior editor at Texas Monthly covering politics, and Mark Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, broke down some of the state’s biggest primary races. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below. This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity: Texas Standard: Now, before we get into the state races, let’s talk some presidential politics here. Former President Trump is leading in all the polls, from what we can tell. But Nikki Haley, I understand, made some campaign stops in Texas. Alex, did you pick up on any message to voters here?  Alexandra Samuels: Yes. So Haley pitched herself as the best person to vote for if people want to see something new. So for at least the past year or so now, voters across the nation have told pollsters that they don’t want a repeat of the 2020 election, meaning they don’t want to see Biden versus Trump again, even though that’s looking more and more likely. But Haley was telling Texas voters that if they really do want to go in another direction, she’s the best and really only candidate for them. Plus, Texas is an open primary state, and Haley’s implied previously that she wants Democratic and independent voters to cross over and cast ballots in the GOP primary to cut into Trump’s lead here. The problem with her message is that it’s falling on deaf ears, or at least it seems to be. So, Mark, I believe it was your poll from the University of Houston that gave Trump like a 60 percentage point lead. Mark Jones: Yeah, it was 80% to 19%. Wow. That’s remarkable. I remember we talked about that a little bit earlier, but, professor, what do you think about that open primary aspect of this race? I mean, is it possible we’ll see a lot of Democrats perhaps moving to support Haley, given her direct appeal to them?  Mark Jones: That’s very doubtful. We tend to not have that much crossover voting. And effectively for many Democrats, while they would prefer Haley to Trump, they prefer Joe Biden than Nikki Haley. And so they’re very unlikely to get involved in the primary. For it to work it, requires perhaps Nikki Haley doing a concerted outreach effort among Democrats and independents. But the more you do something like that, the more it boomerangs on you and causes Republicans to desert you. So Haley’s in a really difficult situation. She faces a primary in her home state of South Carolina on the 24th, where she’s likely to lose by 30 points. Right now, the message she gave us in Texas was she’s going to stay in till the bitter end and she is the last person standing, but it’s going to be tougher and tougher for her to stay in the race if she is delivered a shellacking in her home state of South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday does very poorly, as seems to be the case. It seems like there’s another major race we should turn our attention to, maybe the biggest in Texas right now – the Senate primary race, on the Democratic side. This, by the way, for the seat that’s currently held by incumbent Ted Cruz on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, you have a very crowded field with frontrunners Colin Allred and Roland Gutierrez. Alex, what are you looking for in that race?  Alexandra Samuels: I’m interested to see whether this race will go into a runoff. And just on the polling we’ve seen, I’d say that’s incredibly likely. Allred, of course, has this huge fundraising advantage over everyone else in the field. And I’ve seen over the last couple of days that he’s racked up pretty notable endorsements from a number of editorial boards. But still, there’s a large chunk of voters who don’t know who he is and perhaps more notably, don’t know who they’re going to support in the race. So in a recent story I wrote on the race, we cited a January poll from Emerson College which showed Allred netting only 29% support, compared with Gutierrez’s 7%. But the number that stood out to me is that 37% of respondents were still undecided in this race, with just a few weeks out. » RELATED: Check out our interviews with both Rep. Colin Allred and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez Mark, I want to turn to you about this race in the Houston area, the 18th Congressional district. Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee running again after her loss for Houston mayor. Some are saying this primary could be her most competitive in years. Is that how you see it?  Mark Jones: Oh, definitely. I mean, this is really the most competitive primary she has had since her first one back in 1994, when she actually won the seat for the first time. She’s challenged by Amanda Edwards, a former city council member who’s out-fundraised the congresswoman and I think is in striking distance. It’s one of those races where the congresswoman – that’s Sheila Jackson Lee as we referred to her in Houston, ‘the congresswoman’ – she has a substantial base of support that’s very loyal and very, very likely to turn out for. But if Amanda Edwards can get more nontraditional voters, younger voters and Anglo voters in this African American-majority district to turn out in larger numbers, she has a realistic chance of defeating Jackson Lee. And since there’s a third minor candidate in the race, there’s always the possibility that this goes to a may runoff. But this is clearly the biggest threat that Jackson Lee has ever had. And it’s ironic in that the only reason why Amanda Edwards is running against Sheila Jackson Lee is that Sheila Jackson Lee ran for mayor. And had she won, then there wouldn’t have been an issue. But since she lost, now she’s facing Amanda Edwards because Amanda Edwards was running for mayor, but left the race when Sheila Jackson Lee entered it. Alex, let’s talk about Congressional District 26 – a North Texas seat, made vacant by retiring Michael Burgess, a Republican. Very crowded field. What can you tell us about it?  Alexandra Samuels: It is a very crowded field. In total, there are 11 candidates running in the GOP primary, and many of them have pretty impressive resumes. So Luisa Del Rosal, for instance, previously helped lead the office of Rep. Tony Gonzalez in the 23rd Congressional district. Scott Armey, the former Denton County judge, is also in the race. But right now, the frontrunner to replace Burgess is a 29-year-old newcomer named Brandon Gill. So you might not have heard of Gill before, but you almost certainly have heard of his father-in-law, Dinesh D’Souza. So Gill has the endorsement of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and is pitching himself sort of as an extension of the former president. So he cited fortifying the border wall as a principal policy objective of his, which in his telling, means deporting migrants that he says Biden has brought into the country. But again, with so many candidates, it’s very likely this race will go into a runoff. And what’s also complicating this race is the presence of another hard-charging social conservative on the ballot, and that’s John Huffman. He’s the mayor of Southlake, and he’s trailing very closely behind Gill in terms of fundraising and endorsements. And, professor, I want to move to District 23. Alex mentioned immigration. And of course, this has been prominent and a big part of the conversation leading up to the primary. This district covers like 800 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, including Eagle Pass. It also includes Uvalde. Republican Congressman Tony Gonzalez currently holds that seat on Capitol Hill, but is facing criticism from within his own party – even being censured by the GOP in 2023. What do you see in here?  Mark Jones: Well, Gonzalez took many positions, particularly in 2023 and 2022, that were in the moderate realm in that he voted, for instance, for gun control legislation after the Uvalde massacre. He’s one of the few Republicans to do so. And he adopted a more moderate position on the border. Now since late 2023 and into 2024, he shifted back to the right as he has his primary challenge from people like Brandon Herrera and Victor Avila. So this is a race where I think Gonzales runs the risk of being outflanked on his right by more conservative Republicans. He has a fundraising advantage. He has all the advantages of incumbency, but it’s possible he gets pushed to a runoff. And if it gets pushed to a runoff, then you get a more rarified group of primary voters who tend to be more conservative. And then Gonzales could be vulnerable. But right now, I think he’s probably shifted enough to the right where he’s put himself in a decent position to retain his seat, though not without some effort. Copyright 2024 KUT News.

,,Even Most Biden Voters Don’t See a Thriving Economy,"Times/Siena Poll ADVERTISEMENT  A majority of those who backed President Biden in 2020 say today’s economy is fair or poor, ordinarily a bad omen for incumbents seeking re-election. Lydia DePillis called dozens of Biden voters to hear why they think the economy is bad and what it means for their choice in 2024. Presidents seeking a second term have often found the public’s perception of the economy a pivotal issue. It was a boon to Ronald Reagan; it helped usher Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush out of the White House. Open this article in the New York Times Audio app on iOS. Now, as President Biden looks toward a re-election campaign, there are warning signals on that front: With overall consumer sentiment at a low ebb despite solid economic data, even Democrats who supported Mr. Biden in 2020 say they’re not impressed with the economy. ADVERTISEMENT In a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of voters in six battleground states, 62 percent of those voters think the economy is only “fair” or “poor” (compared with 97 percent for those who voted for Donald J. Trump). Percent of President Biden’s 2020 supporters who ... Notes: Respondents of other races were omitted because of low sample sizes. The figures may not add up to 100 percent because of rounding. Source: New York Times/Siena College polls of 3,662 registered voters conducted Oct. 22 to Nov. 3 in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin The demographics of Mr. Biden’s 2020 supporters may explain part of his challenge now: They were on balance younger, had lower incomes and were more racially diverse than Mr. Trump’s. Those groups tend to be hit hardest by inflation, which has yet to return to 2020 levels, and high interest rates, which have frustrated first-time home buyers and drained the finances of those dependent on credit. But if the election were held today, and the options were Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, it’s not clear whether voter perceptions of the economy would tip the balance. “The last midterm was an abortion election,” said Joshua Doss, an analyst at the public opinion research firm HIT Strategies, referring to the 2022 voting that followed the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling. “Most of the time, elections are about ‘it’s the economy, stupid.’ Republicans lost that because of Roe. So we’re definitely in uncharted territory.” There are things working in Mr. Biden’s favor. First, Mr. Doss said, the economic programs enacted under the Biden administration remain broadly popular, providing a political foundation for Mr. Biden to build on. And second, social issues — which lifted the Democrats in the midterms — remain a prominent concern. ADVERTISEMENT Take Oscar Nuñez, 27, a server at a restaurant in Las Vegas. Foot traffic has been much slower than usual for this time of year, eating into his tips. He’d like to start his own business, but with the rising cost of living, he and his wife — who works at home answering questions from independent contractors for her employer — haven’t managed to save much money. It’s also a tough jump to make when the economy feels shaky. Mr. Nuñez expected better from Mr. Biden when he voted blue in 2020, he said, but he wasn’t sure what specifically the president should have done better. And he is pretty sure another Trump term would be a disaster. “I’d prefer another option, but it seems like it will once again be my only option again,” Mr. Nuñez said of Mr. Biden. For him, immigrants’ rights and foreign policy concerns are more important. “That’s why I was picking him over Trump in the first place — because this guy’s going to do something that’s real dangerous at some point.” Mr. Nuñez isn’t alone in feeling dissatisfied with the economy but still bound to Mr. Biden by other priorities. Of those surveyed in the six battleground states who plan to vote for Mr. Biden in 2024, 47 percent say social issues are more important to them, while 42 percent say the economy is more important — but that’s a closer split than in the 2022 midterms, in which social issues decisively outweighed economic concerns among Democratic voters in several swing states. (Among likely Trump voters, 71 percent say they are most focused on the economy, while 15 percent favor social issues.) ADVERTISEMENT Dour sentiment about the economy also isn’t limited to people who’ve been frustrated in their financial ambitions. Mackenzie Kiser, 20, and Lawson Millwood, 21, students at the University of North Georgia, managed to buy a house this year. Mr. Millwood’s income as an information-technology systems administrator at the university was enough to qualify, and they worried that affordability would only worsen if they waited because of rising interest rates and prices. Still, the experience left a bitter taste. “The housing market is absolutely insane,” said Ms. Kiser, who wasn’t old enough to vote in 2020 but leans progressive. “We paid the same for our one-story, one-bedroom cinder-block 1950s house as my mom paid for her three-story, four-bedroom house less than a decade ago.” Ms. Kiser doesn’t think Mr. Biden has done much to help the economy, and she worries he’s too old to be effective. But Mr. Trump isn’t more appealing on that front. “It’s not that I think that anybody of a different party could do better, but more that someone with their mental faculties who’s not retirement age could do a better job,” Ms. Kiser said. “Our choices are retirement age or retirement age, so it’s rock and a hard place right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Generally, voters don’t think Republicans are fixing the economy, either. In a poll conducted this month by the progressive-leaning Navigator Research, 70 percent of voters in battleground House districts, including a majority of Republicans, said they thought Republicans were more focused on issues other than the economy. The health of the economy is still a major variable leading up to the election. A downturn could fray what the president cites as a signal accomplishment of Bidenomics: low unemployment. A study of the 2016 election found that higher localized unemployment made Black voters, an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency, less likely to vote at all. “I think the likelihood that they would choose Trump is not the threat,” Mr. Doss said. “The threat is that they would choose the couch and stay home, and enough of them would stay home for an electoral college win for Trump.” But in the absence of a competitive Democratic primary, the campaigning — and television spots — have yet to commence in earnest. When they do, Mr. Doss has some ideas. So far, Mr. Biden’s messaging has focused on macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate and tackling inflation. “The truth is, that’s not the economy to most people,” Mr. Doss said. “The economy to most people is gas prices and food and whether or not they can afford to throw a birthday party for their kid.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s difficult for presidents to directly control inflation in the short term. But the White House has addressed a few specific costs that matter for families, by releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to contain surging oil prices in late 2022, for example. The Inflation Reduction Act reduced prescription drug prices under Medicare and capped the cost of insulin for people with diabetes. The administration is also going after what it calls “junk fees,” which inflate the prices of things like concert tickets, airline tickets and even birthday parties. The more the administration talks about its concrete efforts to lower prices, the more Mr. Biden will benefit, Mr. Doss said. At the same time, Mr. Biden can lessen the blowback from persistent inflation by deflecting blame — an out-of-control pandemic was the original cause, he could plausibly argue, and most other wealthy countries are worse off. That’s how it seems to Kendra McDowell, 44, an accountant and single mother of four in Harrisburg, Pa. She feels the sting of inflation every time she goes to the grocery store — she spent $1,000 on groceries this past month and didn’t even fill her deep freezer — and in the health of her clients’ balance sheets. Despite her judgment that the economy is poor, however, she still has enough confidence to start a business in home-based care, a field in greater demand since Covid-19 ripped through nursing homes. “When I talk about the economy, it’s just inflation, and to me inflation is systemic and coming from the Trump administration,” Ms. McDowell said. If the pandemic had been contained quickly, she reasoned, supply chains and labor disruptions wouldn’t have sent prices soaring in the first place. ADVERTISEMENT Moreover, she sees the situation healing itself, and thinks Mr. Biden is doing the best he can given the challenges of the wars in Ukraine and now Gaza. “People are shopping — you know why? Because they’ve got jobs,” Ms. McDowell said. “God forbid, today or tomorrow, if I had to go find a job, it’s easier than it was before.” Ms. McDowell is what’s known in public opinion research as a high-information voter. Polls have shown that those less apt to stay up on the news tend to change their views when provided with more background on what the Biden administration has both accomplished and attempted. The 15-month-old Inflation Reduction Act is still little known, for example. But this past March, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that 68 percent of respondents supported it when filled in on its main components. A frequent theme of conversations with Democratic voters who see the economy as poor is that large corporations have too much power and that the middle class is being squeezed. ADVERTISEMENT Mr. Millwood, Ms. Kiser’s partner, said that he was concerned that society had grown more unequal in recent years, and that he didn’t see Mr. Biden doing much about it. “From what I see, it really doesn’t look like the working class is benefiting from many things recently,” said Mr. Millwood, who supports a higher federal minimum wage and is impatient with the bickering and finger pointing he hears about in Washington. After the phone conversation ended, Mr. Millwood texted to say that upon reflection, he would also like to see Mr. Biden push to lower taxes for low-income families and make it more difficult for the wealthiest to dodge them. After being sent news articles about Mr. Biden’s support for the extension of the now-expired Child Tax Credit and the appropriation of $80 billion for the Internal Revenue Service, in part to pursue tax evaders, he seemed surprised. “That is absolutely what I had in mind,” Mr. Millwood texted. “It’s been so noisy in the media lately I haven’t seen much that is covering things like that,” adding, “Biden doesn’t seem so bad after all haha.” Ruth Igielnik contributed reporting.

,,'I'm not going anywhere': Nikki Haley vows to keep fighting Donald Trump in 2024 GOP race,"GREENVILLE, S.C. — A defiant Nikki Haley vowed to stay in the GOP presidential race, saying it's clear that Americans want a choice beyond Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden. Despite lagging far behind Trump in the polls, Haley cited surveys showing that more than two-thirds of Americans don't want a repeat of the 2020 contest between Trump and Biden. She cast herself as someone who could unite a polarized country, at one point tearing up as she spoke of her husband's service in the Army National Guard. ""The majority of Americans don’t just dislike one candidate,"" Haley said in remarks that her campaign billed as a ""state of the race"" speech. ""They dislike both."" ""The truth is, Americans already know what Joe Biden and Donald Trump will do,"" Haley said. ""They’re dividers at a time when America desperately, urgently, needs a uniter."" On Saturday, she and Trump will face off in her home state of South Carolina. The next contest is Michigan on Feb. 27 and Super Tuesday is on March. 5. Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide Doubling down, Haley promised her supporters and Republican voters alike: ''I'm not going anywhere."" Haley choked up as she talked about her husband Michael's military deployment overseas as she noted he was unable to join her on the trail. Trump previously mocked the absence of Haley's husband and questioned his whereabouts during a rally in early February. Using some of her sharpest language yet to describe the former president, Haley argued that another Trump administration would be a ""disaster"" and that many Republican politicians who publicly support his candidacy ""dread him"" behind closed doors. More:Home sweet home? Donald Trump trounces Nikki Haley in exclusive South Carolina poll Haley also reiterated that she believes she is better positioned than Trump, 77, to defeat President Joe Biden, 81, in a general election match-up. Haley highlighted concerns over both of their ages, calling them ""two old men who are getting older."" However, she dismissed claims that she is running as a ""never Trump"" candidate and emphasized her work as an ambassador to the United Nations during his administration. ""Like most Americans, I have a handful of serious concerns about the former president. But I have countless serious concerns about the current president,"" she said, attacking Biden for his handling of immigration and the economy, among other issues. Trump has attempted to portray Haley as liberal-leaning in recent weeks. The main super PAC that is supporting him, Make America Great Again Inc., trolling Haley that questioned whether she was trying to replace Vice President Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. ""Every dollar spent by Nikki Haley is a dollar spent in support of Joe Biden and the Democrats,"" the group's spokesperson, Alex Pfeiffer, said in the Tuesday statement. In her speech, Haley rejected chatter that she's staying in the race for her own future political ambitions. ""Other people say I’m trying to set up a future presidential run. How does that even work? If I was running for a bogus reason, I would have dropped out a long time ago,"" she said. Haley had pledged on Monday evening to remain in the race until Super Tuesday, telling her supporters during a Greer rally that she planned to head to Michigan on Sunday. Michigan's primary is next Tuesday. Haley will then face a critical stretch of campaigning in 15 states and one territory ahead of their March 5 contests. Her campaign previously signaled that it views that date as a crucial one for her candidacy. Trump's top campaign aides said in a Tuesday morning memo that based on their projections, the former president will amass the require 1,215 delegates to win the GOP nomination no later than March 19. ""The true “State” of Nikki Haley’s campaign? Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump,"" Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote. In an exclusive Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll released Tuesday, Trump is poised to trounce Haley this Saturday in South Carolina. Among those very likely to vote in the state's Republican primary, Trump leads Haley by close to 2-1, 63%-35%. Haley urged voters in her home state to disregard the polls. ""People have a right to have their voices heard and they deserve a real choice, not a Soviet style election where there's only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote"" she said. In Greenville, relief swelled over supporters after listening to Haley’s story where she promised to stay in the race after South Carolina votes on Feb. 24, no matter what the results show. Cynthia Long, a local to downtown Greenville, said that Haley represents a choice for voters. “I think staying in as long as she can afford to is a good thing because it gives the people a choice,” Long said. Even if Haley loses to Trump by a margin larger than 10 points, she said she hopes to see Haley stay in the race “all the way to the convention.” South Carolina State Representative Bart Blackwell, who represents Aiken, echoed the same hopes. He also thinks polls showing Trump leading Haley in her home state are not accurate. “I think we’re going to be surprised on Saturday,"" he said. “That's what American people want. They want a choice, and the race is far from over,” Blackwell said. “And I'm just thrilled with her decision, and I admire her courage for continuing forward.” ",www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/20/is-nikki-haley-dropping-out-donald-trump/72670294007/,
,,How COVID-19 Changed Everything About the 2020 Election,"I
n the 2020 that might have been, nobody is sick and politics is the center of the universe. The Democratic Party has just nominated Joe Biden and his running mate at its mid-July convention in Milwaukee, while Republicans are gearing up to renominate Donald Trump in Charlotte, N.C. At his usual rallies, Trump is pointing to the roaring economy to make his case for re-election, while Biden struggles to stir up crowds with his plea for a return to normalcy. Trump’s allies continue to promote conspiracy theories about the Biden family’s entanglements in Ukraine, leading increasingly desperate Democrats to push for a second impeachment in the House. Both parties are campaigning furiously across the country, knocking on millions of doors to turn out voters in November.    But in the 2020 that’s actually happening, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything–from how the campaign is conducted to how we vote to what we value. It has canceled conventions, relegated fundraising and campaigning to the digital realm, and forced many states to rapidly change how people get and submit their ballots, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous results. The acute crises have refocused the nation’s attention, bringing issues like public health and economic and racial inequality to the fore and prompting the public to revisit what characteristics it wants in its leaders. For four years, Trump has been the dominant force and inescapable fact not only of national politics but also of American life. Now he finds himself displaced as the central character in his own campaign by a plague that answers to no calendar, ideology or political objective. Just as the virus has changed the way adults report to offices and children go to school, upending whole industries in the process, it has spurred a massive shift in the fundamental act of American democracy: how we select the President who will be charged with ending the pandemic’s reign of destruction, dealing with its aftermath and shaping the nation that rises from its ashes. And as with so many other changes wrought by the coronavirus, the practice of American politics may never be quite the same again. This was always going to be an unusual contest–the high-stakes re-election campaign of a historically divisive President at a pivotal moment for the nation, a referendum on his norm-shattering style and disruptive vision, a test for his scattered opposition to prove which side of a polarized political spectrum represents the mainstream. As the campaign enters its final three-month stretch, Trump trails badly in national and battleground-state polls as Americans give his dismal handling of the pandemic a failing grade. But the end of Trump’s turbulent term will be written by the virus. It startled us with its rise and spread in January and February, suspended normal life in March and April, and lulled many into complacency before whipsawing us again with its resurgence in June and July. Who knows what kind of October surprise it may have in store? Like most things these days, presidential politics has adapted in ways that can get a little weird. For example, on Facebook one recent Thursday evening, Donald Trump Jr. is rhapsodizing with the aging former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka about childhood physical abuse. “Maybe a few more kids in this country need a little bit more ass whoopin’ than participation medals!” says Trump Jr., who wears an open-necked purple polo shirt and AirPods. Ditka, whose phone is tilted upward toward his bottle-brush mustache, looks confused. “How can you say that?” he replies. “These poor kids.” The broadcast, an installment of Trump Jr.’s Triggered podcast, epitomizes the content the Trump campaign is feeding hungry supporters online. On another recent evening, it hosted “The Right View,” in which Trump Jr.’s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump’s wife Lara, and Trump campaign aides Mercedes Schlapp and Katrina Pierson laud the debunked virtues of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment in a segment that will eventually rack up more than half a million views on Facebook. The campaign was already creating such online content, but it’s newly central in a world where rallies risk becoming superspreader events. Sign up for the Inside TIME newsletter to get the exclusive story behind TIME covers. The Biden campaign has also moved online, where its presence, like its candidate, is more sedate and traditional. “Events” are advertised to local supporters and organized around constituency groups or issues, just as they would be in a normal campaign. Biden’s wife Jill appears, via Zoom, at a “virtual campaign stop” with the mayor of West Palm Beach, Fla., to talk about his plans for seniors; former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams hosts an online “racial and economic justice roundtable” with business owners in Detroit; Biden himself joins his former running mate, Barack Obama, for a stagey 15-minute “conversation” about the Trump Administration’s failures. Despite the pandemic, Trump had hoped to keep up the rallies central to his political mythology. But an attempted return to the stage in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20 turned into a debacle, with a sparse, mostly maskless crowd that barely filled the bottom deck of the indoor arena. Lately he’s settled for online “tele-rallies,” glorified conference calls that Trump supporters in key states are invited to tune in to a couple of times a week. At a recent one targeting voters in Maine and New Hampshire, Trump dutifully shouts out the local Republican candidates, extols lobster fishermen and vows to get tough on Canadian currency manipulation. Almost 13,000 people are listening live, and hundreds of thousands more will eventually “view” the half-hour audio stream. “The future of our nation will be defined by patriots who love our country and want to build it up and make it bigger and better and stronger–or it will be defined by the radical left. And usually radical left Democrats are left-wing extremists who hate our country,” he intones. In person, this kind of line would draw a roar from Trump’s throngs of admirers, but online, the only feedback is the silent scroll of Facebook comments. Trump’s political adviser Jason Miller says the tele-rallies have been a hit. “The genius of Donald Trump is that he knows how to foster and build one-on-one relationships with his voters,” he says. But it’s clear the virtual gatherings are no substitute for the real thing. Lacking his usual source of mass adulation, the President has taken to touting the crowds that line the streets when he visits various states on official business. Some local candidates–mainly Republicans–are still holding in-person events despite the risks. But the pandemic has become a vector for partisan attacks. When a GOP Senate candidate in Virginia posted a video of himself attending an indoor political event without a mask, the state Democratic Party seized on the image to call him “dangerously irresponsible.” Many state Democratic parties have chosen to hold all-virtual conventions, but several of their GOP counterparts have tried to blaze ahead. The Republican Party of Texas took its case all the way to the state Supreme Court, which sided with the Houston mayor who had canceled its in-person convention. The hastily assembled virtual confab that ensued featured extensive technical difficulties–at one point, Texas Monthly reported, pranksters invaded an online planning document and added “Peepeepoopoo” to the schedule–and by the end angry delegates ousted the state chairman. It’s been a similar story at the national level. Democrats decided early on that the planned July convention in Milwaukee would not be feasible; it was pushed back to mid-August and radically scaled down, with delegates staying home and voting remotely and Biden himself staying away. The GOP has had a bumpier road. In June, Trump moved the convention from Charlotte, N.C., to Jacksonville, Fla., in a fit of pique over the North Carolina Democratic governor’s insistence on safety protocols. As Florida’s COVID-19 caseload surged this summer, party officials made a series of frantic adjustments, culminating in a last-ditch effort to hold the festivities in an outdoor stadium in the August heat. Finally, in late July, Trump announced the Jacksonville program would be scotched; the current plan, which is still being developed, is to hold a small number of party meetings in North Carolina and have the President accept the nomination with a televised speech at a location to be determined. The lack of traditional conventions is perhaps not such a loss. Events where party insiders in smoke-filled rooms once actually picked presidential nominees and running mates have become, in the modern era, little more than infomercials. But they serve as a major engine of the parties’ fundraising–another operation that’s moved online in the age of coronavirus. The swanky catered affairs that donors once paid tens of thousands of dollars per plate to attend are now BYOB livestreams. Campaigns have had to get creative as the novelty fades. “When the stay-at-home orders started, campaigns immediately started doing virtual events–a Zoom fundraiser, a field-organizer hangout,” says Brian Krebs, who works at a Democratic digital-campaign firm called Rising Tide Interactive. “But the bar is rising now that a lot of people are Zoomed out. You’ve got to have a special guest or some kind of hook. People aren’t going to show up if it’s just 12 squares talking.” On the other hand, celebrity guests can be easier to land when they can appear at your fundraiser without leaving L.A. The Texas Democratic Senate nominee MJ Hegar recently recorded an event with the cast of Supernatural and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, none of whom were physically present. Hegar campaign volunteers have also gotten creative with their outreach, holding a voter-registration texting session that doubled as a Taylor Swift listening party. Around this time in an election, campaigns traditionally shift from registering, identifying and persuading voters to pushing them to the polls. The GOP is still doing so, knocking on a million doors a week, the Republican National Committee claims. But on the left, an intense debate has broken out about the ethics of going door-to-door amid a plague. Research suggests that in-person conversations with voters are the most effective way to get them to turn out. But most liberal groups and the Biden campaign aren’t planning on door knocking this year, viewing it as too risky for workers and voters alike. One group that forged ahead, the Progressive Turnout Project, had to suspend its operations in a dozen states after several employees tested positive for COVID-19. The irony is more Americans are eager for political engagement this year. In a Fox News poll in July, 85% said they were extremely or very motivated to vote, and the percentage of respondents who told Gallup they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting was up 10 points from 2016. Despite the difficulties of pandemic voting, primaries in states such as Texas and Georgia have set turnout records. At the same time, new voter registrations have plummeted because of the closure of government offices like departments of motor vehicles. In Pinal County, Arizona, a small progressive organization called Rural Arizona Engagement had gotten only a quarter of the way to its voter-registration goal when it had to stop canvassing in March. Attempts to continue the work by phone were mostly unsuccessful. Even though Arizona is currently a coronavirus hot spot, the group hopes to go back into the field to turn out the vote. “We feel like if we can follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and train our staff in a way that protects them and the people we’re talking to, this is a year that requires this work to be done,” says the group’s co–executive director Natali Fierros Bock. The pandemic, she says, has heightened people’s awareness of why their vote matters. (It’s also increased canvassers’ success rate: with so many people isolated in their homes, more are willing to answer the door and talk with a stranger.) Despite robust public support for wearing masks, the Pinal County board of supervisors decided against a mask mandate for businesses, and the rabble-rousing county sheriff, Mark Lamb, announced he would not enforce the state’s stay-at-home order. (Lamb was forced to cancel a planned appearance with Trump at the White House when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in June.) “People are starting to connect the dots,” Fierros Bock says, “and consider who is serving in these local offices and how much power they wield.” The pandemic landed in the midst of America’s primary-election season, forcing state election officials to adapt on the fly. The results offer a glimpse of the massive challenges the general election will pose–and the disasters that could ensue. One of the first test runs came in Ohio, whose primary was scheduled for March 17, just days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, the NBA abruptly suspended its season and states across the country began rapidly shutting down. When Republican Governor Mike DeWine sought to delay the primary, some candidates sued, and courts ruled he didn’t have the power to do so. Finally, at 4 a.m. on Election Day, with workers already starting to set up for balloting, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the state’s health director could order the polls closed as an emergency measure. But the GOP-controlled legislature wouldn’t go along with DeWine’s proposal to move the vote to June, so a mail-only election with an April 28 deadline was held instead. Other states soon had their own experiences with the logistical, constitutional and political complexities of pandemic voting. In Wisconsin’s April 7 primary–held on schedule after a last-minute standoff between its Democratic governor and Republican legislature–hundreds of polling locations were forced to close when poll workers fearful for their safety declined to show up. Hundreds of thousands of voters still turned out, standing in socially distanced lines for hours to cast their ballots. (One scientific study later tied the election to a surge in COVID-19 cases, though other researchers disagreed with that assessment.) Georgia’s June 9 primary melted down amid short staffing and technical problems, leading to endless lines and significant disenfranchisement that Democrats charged was an intentional bid by GOP officials to suppress the vote. In New York, a state that normally votes almost entirely in person, election officials blame an unprecedented flood of absentee ballots for the fact that more than a month after the June 23 election, they still haven’t declared a winner in some contests. In each case, the coronavirus struck at a system that was already fragile. “It is a mistake to think of the pandemic as something separate from other problems with our election systems,” says Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine. “It interacts with the existing pathologies to make things worse.” Hasen’s most recent book, Election Meltdown, was published on Feb. 4, the day after the calamitous Iowa Democratic caucuses, whose delayed results illustrated the problems balky election infrastructure can produce even without a worldwide epidemic. Many states that have been administering elections in person for decades are now attempting to pivot to mail voting, allowing people to vote absentee without an excuse or by citing COVID-19 as a legitimate medical reason. But not all. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Democratic lawsuit that sought to allow all Texas voters to choose mail ballots. In Georgia, the GOP secretary of state mailed every voter a ballot application for the primary but will not do so for the general election. “I think it’s because there was historic turnout, particularly among Democratic primary voters, and [Republicans] don’t want to encourage that in the general election,” says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. Some states, including California, Nevada and Vermont, will mail ballots to all voters, joining five existing states with universal mail voting. Many others will send all voters an absentee-ballot application, but experts warn they may not be prepared for the flood that is coming. Postage, postmark and notarization or witness requirements vary widely from state to state. States facing pandemic-induced budget crunches aren’t necessarily in a position to pay for protective equipment and millions of stamps, but Congress has allocated only a fraction of the election funding they’ve requested. The U.S. Postal Service, itself teetering on the brink of insolvency, is ill equipped to handle the surge, and Democrats allege the popular agency, recently entrusted to a Trump ally, may be intentionally slowing the mail in urban areas in order to help the President. States’ voting procedures continue to shift as the vote nears, making it difficult for voters to keep track of what’s required. What worries election experts the most is that all these challenges and changes could throw the result into doubt. Barring a blowout, election night is likely to end without a clear winner, and it could take weeks or months to count all the votes. “What we didn’t see in the primary, even where there was confusion or it took weeks to count, was someone calling the election rigged or stolen,” says Aditi Juneja, an attorney who staffs the bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises. “We want to make sure that happens in the general election. If the outcome is unclear or uncertain, that leaves space for bad actors to make wild claims.” That, of course, is exactly what Trump has been doing. Continuing the drumbeat he began in 2016, the President has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the vote, wrongly insisting that mail voting is not secure and that the election will be “rigged.” Trump claims there is a difference between vote by mail, which generally refers to ballots mailed to all voters, and absentee voting, when voters typically must request a ballot. But experts say there’s no difference in terms of security. Trump attacked Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, for going “rogue” when she mailed absentee-ballot applications before the state’s primary–a step many of her GOP counterparts had also taken. “It is not helpful when false or misleading information, mudslinging and partisan rhetoric are injected into the discourse,” Benson tells TIME. “It causes people to have doubts about the sanctity of the process and the validity of their vote. The truth is, we are working every day to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” On July 30, Trump suggested postponing the presidential election, prompting an immediate outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike. “The concerns the President has raised are not valid in the state of Ohio,” Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose, a Republican, tells TIME. “Both political parties in Ohio have trusted our system for 20 years and work hard to get voters to take advantage of voting by mail.” As for postponing the election, “That is not something we should even be considering,” he says. Election experts of both parties worry that Trump’s pernicious campaign to undermine confidence in the election’s integrity is a pretext for refusing to accept the result if he loses, throwing the nation into constitutional crisis or worse. When a bipartisan group of academics and former officials called the Transition Integrity Project recently war-gamed a contested election, every iteration of the exercise produced “both street-level violence and political impasse,” the group’s organizer, Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks, told the Boston Globe. When the reality of the pandemic began to set in, Trump’s approval rating initially went up, as often happens for Presidents in times of crisis. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump–which has stayed within a narrow band throughout his term–reached 46% in late March, the highest level since his Inauguration, according to the polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight. Then it began to plummet. Today, barely 40% approve of Trump’s performance, while nearly 55% disapprove. Americans now disapprove of his handling of the pandemic by a 20-point margin. Biden holds significant leads in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan. States such as Texas, Arizona and Georgia, which Democrats haven’t won at the presidential level in decades, may now be up for grabs. Many top Republicans fret that their candidates are in for a wipeout up and down the ballot. “The breadth and depth of Trump’s weakness is hard to overstate,” says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, a member of the Navigator Research team that has surveyed more than 24,000 Americans on a rolling basis since March. “There was a little bit of rally-round-the-flag at the beginning–people wanted him to succeed–and then when it was clear that he wasn’t taking it seriously, you saw that change.” In truth, Trump was an unusually weak incumbent long before the pandemic hit, the only President never to top 50% approval in Gallup’s regular tracking. His current rating remains higher than his nadir of 35% in August 2017, after the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Democrats’ current 8-point advantage on the generic ballot is about the same as their margin in the national vote in 2018. Biden has consistently held an edge over Trump, posting margins similar to or greater than the current state polls since before he even entered the race. A large portion of the American electorate seems to have made up its mind about this President early on, abandoning him–and his party–and never looking back. Indicators that normally correlate to incumbents’ political fortunes, such as the economy, may not apply this year, says GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. The situation is simply too anomalous. Many people see the pandemic as a fluke wrought by China, and may be receptive to the argument that the economic pain is not the President’s fault. Trump may also be benefiting from the popular emergency economic relief legislation Democrats helped him enact. “The country can unite behind its leaders in a crisis if they feel like things are at least moving in the right direction,” Ruffini says. “The summer’s case spike seemed to break off that possibility for the President. He’ll still have a chance to show that things have turned a corner before November, but time is running very short.” COVID-19 has changed the tenor of the election in unmistakable ways. Optimism has nosedived: the share of people who believe the U.S. is on the right track has declined 20 points since March. The pandemic has brought new urgency to issues like access to health care, inequality and the social safety net, while driving Trump’s preferred topics of immigration and trade out of the picture. “The voters are fundamentally the same, but the context of the 2020 election has changed,” says UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, author of Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America. Trump’s character flaws suddenly loom larger for voters. “For a long time, it was annoying but it didn’t necessarily change anything in their lives–‘I wish he’d stop tweeting, but the economy’s good,'” says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, which commissioned polls and focus groups of thousands of voters in suburban swing districts. “What this has done is to put the perception they already had about Trump together with real, horrific impacts on them and their family and their country.” Asked an open-ended question about Trump’s vision for the country, about half the respondents in Third Way’s surveys volunteered “self-serving” or “divisive.” Respondents also rejected his calls for “law and order” in response to street protests. Asked who is hurt by Trump’s vision, 30% of undecided suburban voters said “all of us.” “It used to be people would say LGBT people, or women, or people of color,” Erickson says. “Now, 4% say immigrants, 6% say minorities–but 30% say all of us.” Some focus-group participants were asked what they were looking for in the election. The responses were heavy on leadership qualities: people yearned for someone who was strong, compassionate and listened to experts. People agreed that Trump was strong (and questioned Biden’s strength) but rated the President abysmally on the other two. Just as Trump’s worst qualities were magnified, Biden’s strengths suddenly seem matched to the moment. When he announced his candidacy a year ago, he said he was compelled to run by Trump’s equivocal response to Charlottesville. Some Democrats criticized his mantra of a “battle for the soul of the nation” as too puffy or vague at a time when his rivals were pumping out ambitious left-wing policy proposals. But a character-based campaign, tinged with nostalgia, now looks not just prescient but essential, whether or not you believe Biden has what it takes to deliver on it. Trump’s campaign insists he is positioned for victory despite the headwinds. Public polls are undercounting Republicans, says Miller, the Trump political adviser, and the President’s supporters are more enthusiastic about voting by a 2-to-1 ratio. “Are people going to stand in line for two hours to vote for someone they’re not enthusiastic about?” he asks. But analysts in both parties are skeptical. “Overwhelmingly, voters believe the pandemic and the resulting economic meltdown are the most important issues facing the country,” says GOP pollster Whit Ayres. “Efforts to change the subject might work with people who are already in favor of the President, but there’s no evidence they’re working with the people who need to be brought into his coalition if he’s going to win.” If the pandemic has revealed the fault lines in American society, it has exposed something else too: some things are still too important to get caught up in politics. Trump’s attempts to make public health a partisan matter have mostly failed. Large majorities of Americans support their states’ pandemic restrictions, believe it’s more important to rein in the virus than to get the economy up and running, think more needs to be done and–by resounding margins–support mask wearing. The national mood has undergone a wholesale shift in this most tumultuous of election years. In Third Way’s studies, voters talked about feelings of sadness, anger, anxiety and fear. Pollsters’ response rates have skyrocketed because so many lonely, homebound people are answering the phone just to have someone to talk to. America is a divided nation, but also one that craves communion and solidarity. When a Black man was brutally murdered on video by police in Minneapolis, people took to the streets in unprecedented numbers. Three-quarters of Americans said they backed the recent racial-justice protests, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged, stunning political observers. It’s hard to imagine this happening without Trump. But it’s hard to imagine it without COVID-19 too. When one day Americans look back on this plague, the campaign it coincided with will be an inextricable part of the story. The U.S. has held elections under difficult circumstances before: wars, depressions, natural disasters. Each time, in the face of difficulty, we voted on schedule; each time, democracy gave us the opportunity to choose how we would steer out of the crisis. –With reporting by MARIAH ESPADA and ABBY VESOULIS Correction, August 6 The original version of this story misstated the location of the celebrity guests at a MJ Hegar virtual event.

,,"Instead of Challenging Joe Biden, Maybe the Green Party Could Help Change Our Democracy","  To distract myself from wondering if my chest is tightening, I sometimes think about other things that could go really wrong this year. The list is long, but somewhere near the very top is the thought that the President could somehow eke out a close election victory, despite—well, despite everything. There’s no guarantee it won’t happen. The Democrats didn’t find a perfect candidate, and there’s going to be an endless blizzard of Facebook lies, and team Trump is topnotch at voter suppression. But there are ways to lessen the odds a little, and a good one would be to not have a third-party challenge from the left this year, at least in the six or seven battleground states that are going to make the difference. That means asking the Green Party to stand down in those places. People with impressive left credentials—Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, Ron Daniels—did this already, in January, in a well-argued open letter. But it didn’t seem to work: the Party’s most likely Presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, declared that he would run even if the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, who, Hawkins told an interviewer, had been “a little slow” in his plans for reform. Hawkins has run many times for governor of New York, and also for the House and the Senate from that state, while never getting more than five per cent of the vote. (He did come in a respectable second in a Fourth District city-council race in his home town of Syracuse, in 2013.) “Recognizing the danger of Trump does not mean that electing any damned Democrat should trump all other considerations,” Hawkins said. So I probably won’t be able to persuade him, either, but let me at least offer the suggestion that there’s a particularly useful reform that Greens—and others interested in a more vibrant politics—could be working on, instead, this autumn. To understand why this reform—ranked-choice voting—seems so important to me, let me say that, by ideology, I’m pretty much a Green. One of my favorite politicians anywhere is Bob Brown, a former member of the Australian Senate, who, in 1972, helped found what was arguably the first Green Party (and also saved a large portion of Tasmania’s classic wilderness). I’ve given speeches on behalf of German Greens and European Union Greens and local Green parties in many states and cities, and, whenever Canada holds an election, I stay up to watch the returns from the island district in the Pacific, off Vancouver, just to make sure that Elizabeth May, who for many years led the nation’s Green Party, has retained her seat. So I’m about as small-“g” green as green gets, having spent my adult life working on the greatest environmental crisis in the history of our civilization, the rapid heating of our planet. But I haven’t supported the Green Party in national elections in this country, and that’s because of the way our electoral laws work. The obvious difference between the United States on the one hand and most of Europe on the other is that we have a de-facto plurality-winner-take-all two-party system that makes it all but impossible for a small party to make a non-perverse difference, while European countries have parliamentary systems with electoral mechanisms that encourage small parties to play constructively pivotal roles. Time and again, by winning five or ten or twenty per cent of the vote, and a like share of seats, the Greens who operate in parliamentary democracies have ended up with enough representatives to give them bargaining power when it came time to form coalition governments. And those bargains make big differences: having the Greens in a power-sharing government was a major reason that Germany pioneered renewable energy; currently, in British Columbia, a Green-Liberal coalition has bolstered opposition to giant pipelines. In the United States, winning a few percentage points of the vote gets you nothing, except a chance to argue about whether you were the spoiler. Ralph Nader, in 2000, and Jill Stein, in 2016, have roundly insisted that they weren’t, arguing that the Democrats who were defeated in crucial states by margins smaller than their vote totals there did not run skillful enough campaigns. Relitigating that history seems less essential than looking ahead: the last poll I saw for Wisconsin showed that the race between a Democrat and Trump, for the state that many analysts predict will sway the election, was currently within three percentage points. So, if a Green Party candidate is on the ballot and attracts even a smidgen of support—well, it could end very badly indeed. And why would you take that chance this year? That’s not to say that America wouldn’t be better off with more electoral alternatives. We clearly would. And to get them we needn’t wait for some unlikely constitutional change that might produce a parliamentary system. Instead, we can work to get more states to follow the lead of Maine, which last year introduced a ranked-choice voting system for most elections. Here’s how it works: if there are ten candidates on your ballot, you list your choices from one to ten. You can proudly vote for the Green candidate as your No. 1 choice for Congress, and, if she comes in last, you haven’t lost your vote or spoiled someone else’s chances. That’s because that vote would then be eliminated and your second-ranked vote would be counted instead, and so on, until someone has won a majority. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Reporter’s Video from Inside the Capitol Siege This is not some impossible dream of a reform—pundits used to say “as Maine goes so goes the nation,” and, indeed, last year, after Maine adopted the plan, so did New York City, with the support of seventy-three per cent of its voters. “Before the pandemic, R.C.V. was gaining momentum, with efforts teed up in several states to advance it via ballot initiative or legislative lobbying,” Josh Silver, the director of the electoral-reform campaign RepresentUs, said. “A ballot initiative for R.C.V. is likely in Alaska this year, and possibly in North Dakota and Massachusetts. There is a huge opportunity for legislative lobbying efforts in many other states, blue and red, as evidenced by the deep-red Utah legislature’s vote to allow their cities to enact R.C.V.” That is to say, Green enthusiasts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could skip Presidential campaigning and, instead, push their legislatures hard to put R.C.V. on the agenda. The pandemic has only increased the urgency, because the one drawback of a now necessary vote-by-mail system is that candidates sometimes drop out of elections after you’ve mailed in your ballot. Silver again: “This happened to millions of voters in this year’s primary, and R.C.V. fixes it. We must lean in hard to this opportunity.” If we managed to enact this reform, the result would be a much better system in many ways. One is that you could really build small progressive parties without potential supporters worrying that they’d inadvertently elect Trumpish figures; if the Greens, or any third party, are ever going to have a real breakthrough on a national level, it will be because people can vote for them without fear, real or imagined, of being a spoiler. But there’s another reason, too, which I got to see close up while covering elections as a young city-hall reporter in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which for decades was the only major city in the country to use R.C.V. It’s that these elections not only allow for more ideological diversity but also tend to reduce the truly hateful divisiveness that’s become such a feature of our elections. If you’re a candidate in a ranked-choice election, you have a strong incentive not to be a sneering jerk to your competitors, because that kind of behavior reduces your chances of getting crucial No. 2 votes. You have to make your case, and you have to at least understand someone else’s. Obviously, campaigning for R.C.V. is less sexy than campaigning for President, and it will take a little while (though the whole Green Party project seems premised on a kind of radical patience). If the Party insists on running a Presidential candidate in the few states where it really matters, I hope people will not waste their votes on them. That’s not because I think Joe Biden is a hero; it’s because I think he’s not only better than the alternative but also pushable. Politics doesn’t end on Election Day—if you’re serious about change, politics in some ways begins once the votes are counted, with the less exciting business of prodding politicians to keep promises or opening up the political space for them to do what they want. In that world, which is always the real world, the job is to elect a politician whom you have a chance of pushing, one who might take advantage of openings that movements can provide. So, for instance, I had no problem working hard to elect Barack Obama as President (and Joe Biden as Vice-President), and also no problem helping gather some of the largest demonstrations of their Administration outside the White House. We were pushing for Obama to keep his pledge to be a climate activist by opposing the construction of the Keystone Pipeline; he eventually came on board. That was a hugely important development in the fight against climate change—and it launched similar movements around the world. With Trump’s election, of course, that kind of opening ceased—there’s no point pushing someone who takes pride in destruction. Now, there’s a very real chance that the pipeline will be built. Magnify that scenario across all the issues of the day and you see why most climate activists I know just shake their heads at the thought of a third-party challenge this November. It took me a while to reach that point. In the first Presidential election I ever voted in, in 1980, I voted for Barry Commoner, of the Citizens Party (albeit in the safely blue state of Massachusetts). But the results of that and subsequent elections convinced me that Americans would do well to avoid third parties at the national level until our electoral structure shifts. That’s why, I think, Bernie Sanders has run for President as a Democrat and has always insisted that he would support the Party’s eventual nominee. As he told Biden on Monday afternoon, in his endorsement announcement, “I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every Independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy.” (He has also shown that you can change politics in dramatic ways from within the Democratic Party.) After Sanders lost in 2016 Democratic primary, I campaigned strenuously for Hillary Clinton across the swing states of the Midwest, and it was there that I began to worry that the Green Party was doing just well enough to threaten real trouble. So, that October, I wrote about the importance of voting for Clinton, even if she wasn’t your first choice. I don’t want to wait that long this time, and I know from reading the work of such long-standing Green activists as Ted Glick that there’s an active debate within the Green Party about the wisdom of competing in this year’s Presidential election. I hope it’s never necessary to write any take on this subject again. And not because the Greens or other idea-oriented parties disappear but because we rebuild our electoral system in easily doable ways that would allow for better elections.

By ,,Biden campaign directs ads to Black and Latino voters in key swing states,"Asma Khalid ,  Tamara Keith The Biden reelection campaign is already facing headwinds, with concerns about the candidate's age and his second-place showing to Donald Trump in early polls.  ASMA KHALID, HOST: The last thing you all probably want to talk about right now is politics. But for those of us who cover this all the time, it's clear a presidential election year is upon us. And 2024 is promising to be like no campaign we have experienced so far. My friend and colleague NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith is following the Biden campaign and joins us now with a preview of the year ahead. Good morning, my friend. TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hey, Asma. KHALID: So the campaign is still in its early stages, but what can you tell us about how Biden plans to run based on the kinds of things that he's been doing? KEITH: Well, we've all seen polls showing Biden may have serious trouble with younger voters and voters of color. They are turned off from politics and, in some cases, disillusioned. So the Biden campaign is already spending money on advertising directed to Black and Latino voters in key swing states. And part of that is trying to figure out which messages will work and how to get them to people. Not a lot of them are likely to vote for Trump or a Republican, but they could stay home or vote for a third-party candidate. And the Biden campaign needs to get them engaged so they do vote and vote for Biden. KHALID: So how does what we are seeing now compare to Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012? KEITH: Well, they had a ton of people out in the field, organizers in these key states. The Biden campaign just doesn't have that yet, and that makes some Democrats nervous. But the Biden team says they have to do things differently because the way people get information has changed so dramatically since then. And they have begun announcing some new hires in swing states - Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada. We'll be talking about them a lot in the year to come, and we can expect to see more of that. Interestingly, they also have staff now in South Carolina. That's a state that is definitely going to go Republican in the general election, but it holds the first officially sanctioned Democratic primary of the year in early February. And the Biden team wants to win. KHALID: Yeah. Tam, you and I hear the president talk every day, trying to convince voters to give him credit for the policies that he has enacted during his time in office. How do you expect that to shift at all once the campaign kicks into full gear? KEITH: We're going to see him draw a lot of contrasts with Trump and Republicans on everything from health care to abortion to green jobs. And reporters like us have been hearing some of this in campaign fundraisers already, where he is refining his stump speech, talking about the stakes in 2024. These are off camera, but here's a taste from a recent Boston fundraiser. The audio is a little hard to hear because it was filmed on a phone by someone in the audience. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Donald Trump poses a lot of threats to our country, from the right to choose, the Affordable Care Act, health care overall to America's standing in the world. But the greatest threat he poses of all is toward our very democracy. KEITH: Our very democracy, he says. In these remarks, he talks about Trump's authoritarian language and his promise of retribution. The Biden team expects this election will be incredibly close, especially in those swing states. KHALID: So, Tam, let's go back to where our conversation started in terms of what makes this such an unusual election cycle. KEITH: First, there are essentially two incumbents - President Biden and, unless something dramatic changes, former President Trump, who still claims, falsely, that the last election was stolen from him. To be blunt, both are older than any president elected to a second term. They are also really unpopular, and a large share of voters say they are not looking forward to a rematch. Then you have Trump's indictments, and House Republicans have now voted to formally open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. His son is facing tax evasion and gun charges. All of this just introduces a massive amount of uncertainty. KHALID: All right. A lot to keep an eye on. NPR senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith, thanks so much. KEITH: You're welcome.

,,American Voters Concerned About Age of Presidential Candidates,"Print Early primary results indicate that the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be a rematch of the 2020 contest between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, with voters choosing between someone who would be the country’s oldest president (Biden) or its second-oldest president (Trump). Many voters are unhappy with the choice. An ABC News/Ipsos poll earlier this month found 59% of Americans think both presumptive nominees are too old to serve another term. “Every indication seems to be that most Americans are not looking forward to a replay of 2020,” University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock told VOA. “If either party could come up with a quality, younger nominee, that person would win by a landslide.” Connecticut mother Rebecca Urrutia agrees. “The age of our candidates is extremely concerning,” she said. “It’s proof that our two-party system has completely crashed and burned. “Are we voting for two men who are in their 80s, or are we voting for the people they’ve chosen to be their vice presidents?” she added. “The chance they won’t be able to finish their term because of dementia, senility or other health reasons isn’t unbelievable. Something in our system is broken, and we have to fix it.” How did this happen? Robert Collins, professor of urban studies and public policy at Dillard University in New Orleans, believes Americans feel like they’re not being given a real choice. “For many of us, it feels like a Back to the Future situation,” he told VOA, referencing the 1985 movie. “It’s a choice between the same two old guys we had last time, and a lot of Americans are left wondering how this happened and if it means something is wrong with our democracy.” Collins says the candidates’ advanced ages are an inconvenient accident rather than a trend. “I don’t think anyone in the last few election cycles has said, ‘Let’s go look for the oldest guys!’” he said and laughed. “Rather, it just so happened that Trump’s message resonated most among Republicans, and that Biden was the compromise candidate from a 2020 primary field crowded with younger Democratic candidates.” The University of Georgia’s Bullock believes structures of the American political system are partly to blame for candidates trending older. “Some of this problem has to be attributed to the way Congress is elected,” he said. “Gerrymandering has created less competitive districts. That, in combination with no congressional term limits, means you have politicians who can stay in office for decades without ever being seriously challenged. The result is that much of our country’s leadership, not just our presidential candidates, are older.” Potential impact Regardless of the reasons, age is an issue in this election. Seventy-one-year-old Norma Rodrigues of Miami, Florida, says that’s not right. “Just as age shouldn’t be an issue in any workplace when it doesn’t affect capacity, it shouldn’t matter in politics either,” she told VOA. “Rather, we should vote on traits like character, empathy and trustworthiness.” Rodrigues says the rematch between two older candidates is not indicative of a broken political system, though it does highlight a flaw. “I think it illustrates a lack of political engagement among younger generations of Americans,” she explained. “Maybe it’s caused by a deep disappointment with the candidates, or with what their elected officials have been able to accomplish after taking office.” Age perception between the candidates While the age gap between President Biden and former President Trump is less than four years, the gap in how Americans view their age is wide. The ABC News/Ipsos poll that found 59% of Americans think both candidates are too old, and an additional 27% said only Biden is too old. In contrast, only 3% of Americans said only Trump is too old to serve again. “Whether it’s fair or not, I think Biden reads to Americans as being older than Trump,” explained Collins from Dillard University. “His walk is a little stiffer, his speech is a little slower, and he’s more soft-spoken than Trump. It’s an issue his campaign needs to figure out how to fix.” Democratic voter Deborah Theobald from the U.S. state of Georgia says age “is definitely a big issue for me in this election, but apparently these two are all we’ve got to choose between.” “So maybe we should talk about competency instead,” she continued. “Biden surrounds himself with great people, and he has a vice president who, should she have to take over, is prepared. Trump, on the other hand, tried to hang his last vice president during his January 6 insurrection, and is overall incompetent at hiring. That’s why I’m voting for Biden.” Theobald was referring to Trump's failure to urge his supporters to stand down when they began chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"" during the January 6 riot. Republican voter Jill Dani from Merritt Island, Florida, wants a younger candidate but will stick with Trump over Biden. “I think the Republican Party needs a new face to lead the party, which is why I’ll vote for Nikki Haley in the primary,” Dani told VOA. “But if Trump beats her, you had better believe I’ll vote for him in the general election. This election, and getting rid of Biden and the Democrats, is too important to skip.”  ",www.voanews.com,https://www.voanews.com/a/american-voters-concerned-about-age-of-presidential-candidates/7495604.html,
,,Democrats have their own worries,"FEB 20, 2024 There’s no way to quantify this, but, suffice it to say, reams and reams of column inches have been gobbled up as reporters chronicle the continuing dramatic soap opera — now in its second year — within the state Republican Party concerning who is the legit party chair. So how ’bout a little equal time for the Democrats, who have their own internal headaches to sort through. Some party dissidents, who consider themselves to be well-meaning, are mounting a full-throttled effort to send the sitting president a message regarding his handling of the Gaza-Israeli war. Their message is: Knock it off and demand a ceasefire to end the brutal human carnage, which is now in its fourth month. One hundred and fifty thousand phone calls in one week on that, and 87,000 to be contacted via email soon. With the Feb. 27 Michigan presidential primary just around the corner, the anti-war group is urging fellow Democrats to vote “uncommitted,” rather than vote for President Joe Biden. “This is not anti-Biden,” one of the national consultants who is working with Michigan Democrats to pull that off explains. It’s aimed at getting him to change course now. But folks like the current Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former Gov. Jim Blanchard are worried that, when the dust settles, that effort will play into the hands of the Donald Trump forces who will use it against Biden by suggesting that “many of Joe Biden’s Democrats are deserting him.” Blanchard figures that “threat on Biden won’t work,” which means it won’t result in a policy shift, but it could cost the president even more votes in November. At the vanguard of the effort in Michigan is former Oakland County progressive Democrat and former Congressman Andy Levin, who believes the effort will work if enough of his compatriots send a strong message by withholding their votes. Part of the coalition to do so includes Arab Americans, Muslim activists, and young Democrats, and Levin believes the president is at risk of losing the state in November if those folks stay home. “They are not going to vote for Trump,” he reassures the White House, but, if they stay home, others figure that is indirectly a vote for Trump, because it’s one less vote for the incumbent. Levin describes that very serious internal revolt in terms of a loving marriage in which you work out your differences in a peaceful give-and-take, with the goal of not only staying together but making the relationship stronger. He thinks that, if 20% or more of the voters vote uncommitted, Biden will eventually “be the peacemaker” and go around the Israeli leader who is hellbent on destroying the enemy and a ceasefire be damned. Levin also believes that, after making their protest known, those Democrats will come home to the president. But what if they don’t? Whitmer reminds the malcontents that that could help Trump regain the White House, and “this would be bad for your communities” of Dearborn and other districts where concern over the war is off the charts. Levin counters he does not want to see the situation evolve into another anti-Vietnam nationwide protest, and, given the number of demonstrations on college campuses and the like, that notion does not appear to be that far-fetched. “The young people are very worried,” he reports. And, just like the Republicans, now the Democrats have something to worry about, too, i.e. a loss to Trump aided and abetted by members of their own party.

,,"Less than half of young Americans plan to vote in 2024, Harvard poll finds","       After record youth turnout in the 2020 elections, fewer Americans ages 18 to 29 plan to vote in 2024 in part due to widespread dissatisfaction with both President Joe Biden and his likely challenger former President Donald Trump, according to a new poll of young people by Harvard’s Institute of Politics. Compared to the same period in the 2020 election cycle, young Americans “definitely” planning to vote in the next presidential election dropped eight percentage points – from 57% to 49%. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated 54.1% of 18- to 29-year-olds voted in 2020, which had the highest youth turnout overall of any election in the 21st century. Another 17% said they will “probably vote” and another 14% said there's a 50-50 chance.  “From a lack of trust in leaders on a variety of critical issues such as climate change, gun violence, and the war in the Middle East, to worries about the economy and AI, young people’s concerns come through loud and clear in our new poll,” the institute’s director Setti Warren said in a statement. “As the 2024 campaign season kicks into high gear, candidates up and down the ballot would be wise to embrace the opportunity to listen to – and re-engage – this generation.” While young voters overwhelmingly preferred Biden over Trump, to the tune of 57% to 33%, neither candidate garnered more than 40% support when asked whether respondents trusted them more than their rival on issues ranging from democracy and “strengthening the working class,” to abortion, education and climate change. Both candidates have been courting the youth vote in their bids to win the White House for a second time. Biden won the record-setting youth vote by 24 percentage points in 2020, but a lack of progress on important issues to younger voters and the president’s response to mounting Palestinian civilian casualties in the Israel-Hamas war has left him vulnerable to more defectors and nonvoters. “President Biden has a choice: Declare a climate emergency and support a ceasefire in Gaza or lose the youth vote,” the Sunrise Movement posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. The influential climate change group is active in youth advocacy on the Democratic Party’s left and can be partially credited for popularizing the economic and climate policy platform known as the Green New Deal, adopted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and mined for parts by Biden. On each of the issues respondents were asked about, roughly one-third or more said they trusted neither candidate to handle them well. But young Americans trusted Biden and Trump the least to handle the Israel-Hamas war, with 44% saying they trusted neither man. More than half of independent voters lacked trust in both candidates to resolve the crisis. “In a recent Quinnipiac poll, Americans voters overall sympathize with Israelis over Palestinians by a margin of 54-24. But among voters under 35, the numbers are nearly the reverse of that, with young voters more sympathetic to Palestinians by a 52-29 margin,” longtime polling analyst Nate Silver wrote in a recent newsletter. “Should Biden do more to cater — or if you prefer, to pander — to young voters? Actually, I think that’s not so clear. A more pro-Palestine stance probably would help Biden with young voters, for instance — but it’s unpopular with the rest of the electorate and might hurt Biden overall.” Here’s what else the poll found on key issues: Forced to pick between the two, adults under 30 prefer Biden over Trump 41% to 30%, with 13% unsure and 15% saying they wouldn’t vote. Biden held the advantage over Trump when it came to protecting democracy (39% to 27%), abortion (39% to 24%), education (39% to 25%), climate change (39% to 19%), health care (36% to 26%), gun violence (35% to 25%) and the war in Ukraine (33% to 29%). Trump was more trusted than Biden when it came to immigration policy (34% to 31%), “strengthening the working class (31% to 34%), crime and public safety (32% to 29%), crime and public safety (29% to 32%), national security (37% to 27%), the economy (25% to 40%) and the Israel-Hamas war (29% to 25%). Nearly 70% of respondents who favored Biden over Trump said their vote was based more on “opposition to Donald Trump becoming president again” than “support for President Biden and his policies. Meanwhile, two-thirds of young Trump supporters said their vote was based on loyalty to the GOP primary frontrunner compared to 35% who said they supported Trump because of their opposition to Biden. When current and potential independent candidates like conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., leftist Cornel West and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., are included in the poll, 29% of young Americans pick Biden, 25% pick Trump and 10% pick Kennedy, while West and Manchin log 3% and 2%, respectively. Over 30% said they didn’t know. In a field with the independent candidates, Biden’s lead increases to eight points among registered young voters and 16 points among likely voters. Biden’s approval rating was at 35%, Vice President Kamala Harris’ was at 36%, Democrats in Congress garnered 40% approval and only 27% approved of House Republicans’ job performance. A plurality of respondents (38%) reported an independent or unaffiliated political registration, while 35% said they were affiliated with Democrats and 26% with Republicans A major contributing factor to the decline in planned youth participation since 2019 were ten-point declines in Republicans (66% to 56%) and independents (41% to 31%)  expecting to vote. Democrats only lost two percentage points since last cycle, dropping from 68% to 66%. Around 70% of college graduates planned on voting, roughly equal to what polling found in 2019, but college students saw a 13 percentage point drop and young Americans not in college and without a degree saw a eight percentage point drop in planned participation. While 65% of young Americans generally believe their finances are either very or fairly good, 48% said the national economy was “fairly bad” and 22% said it was “very bad.” Young Black and Hispanic Americans saw the starkest declines in planned participation. In the poll from autumn 2019, half of Black young people told pollsters they planned to vote. In the poll released Tuesday and conducted from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6, just 38% said they would in 2024. For Hispanics, the decline was even starker, falling from 56% to 40%. Young white Americans saw a slimmer decline, from 62% to 57%.  Majorities of Black and Hispanic voters have long been a base of support for Democrats. But while recent polling shows a Biden holds a vast lead over Trump among Black voters and a slim one among Hispanic voters, Trump’s support appears to have grown since 2020. Despite receiving single digit support from Black voters in his first two presidential campaigns, an October New York Times/Siena College poll found 20% of Black voters in six key battleground states were “probably” or “definitely” planning to vote for Trump. Hispanic voters in those states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – Biden edged out Trump 43% to 39%. While represented by a small sample size – just 646 respondents out of 3,662 total – voters ages 18 to 29 in those battleground states said they were more likely to vote than Harvard’s national survey found. The Times/Siena poll found 87% of young Americans were “almost certain,” “very likely” or “somewhat likely” to vote in 2024’s presidential election. What’s the solution? Both Trump and, to a greater extent due to his reliance on their support, Biden will spend the next year trying to appeal to the youth vote and encourage them to turnout. Respondents to the Harvard poll had some suggestions. Majorities of young Americans who may vote, but aren’t committed yet said they would find certain tactics helpful at encouraging them to cast a ballot: voting deadline reminders (67%), conversations with friends and family members (64%), a non-partisan voting guide (63%), a nonpartisan how-to-vote training (57%) and meeting a candidate or campaign representative in person (53%). “The bad news is that fewer young people intend to vote in this election compared to the Biden-Trump election of 2020. The good news is there's still time, and we know what Gen Z and young millennials want to see and hear,” Harvard’s Institute of Politics polling director John Della Volpe said in a statement. “They want evidence that democracy works, that government can address our challenges, and that there's a meaningful difference between the two parties.”        ",www.ny1.com,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/12/05/young-americans-harvard-poll-trump-biden,
,,"The not-surprising, very bad defeat of Biden’s attempt to protect voting","The reason it failed is simple: 50 Republicans didn’t support the proposals and two Democrats opposed changing the filibuster Hello, and happy Thursday, It’s difficult to figure out what to say about the kind-of-surprising-yet- not-really-surprising-at-all collapse of Democrats’ effort to pass sweeping voting rights legislation. Yes, the defeat is a major blow to Joe Biden, who spent significant political capital over the last few weeks, pushing the bill. Yes, the defeat makes Democrats, who pledged to protect voting rights when they took control of the US Senate last year, look incapable of governing. Yes, it’s disturbing to see just one Republican – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – voice any kind of support for sweeping protections to support the right to vote. Yes, it’s astonishing to see two moderate Democrats block the bill because of their unflinching support for an arcane Senate rule. Yes, the defeat comes at a uniquely dangerous moment for democracy. There are plenty of takes to go around about why this push didn’t succeed – and I expect there will be more in the coming days. Biden should have pushed harder on voting rights sooner. Democrats were too ambitious in their proposal. Democrats should have focused on a narrower fix to the Electoral Count Act. Some of this thinking falls into what Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth, calls the “green lantern theory” of the presidency – a belief that the president can do anything, persuade anyone, if they try hard enough. In the end, the reason the voting rights bills failed was simple – 50 Republicans didn’t support the proposals and two Democrats didn’t support changing the filibuster. After watching the fight in Washington play out over the last few weeks, I’m not sure there’s anything Chuck Schumer or Biden could have done to change that. Maybe I’m wrong. That doesn’t mean that the 50 Republicans who blocked the bill should evade scrutiny. As others have noted, 16 current GOP senators voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006, but oppose the current bill, which would update the most powerful part of the law. Republicans have said Congress has no constitutional role in elections, ignoring a provision in Article I that explicitly authorizes Congress to set federal election rules. But the thing that’s stuck with me the most over the last week is an idea that undergirded the entire voting rights debate, sometimes spoken out loud and sometimes unsaid – the idea that voter suppression just isn’t that bad right now. I saw it a few months ago when an unnamed White House adviser told the Atlantic Democrats would figure out how to out-organize new voter restrictions (“show us what the rules are and we will figure out a way to educate our voters and make sure they understand how they can vote and we will get them out to vote”). Biden made a similar comment on Wednesday afternoon, saying “no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you’re going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote.” I saw it when Republican senators consistently touted that 94% of Americans said it was easy to vote in 2020 and that turnout was higher than ever. And I saw it on Tuesday, when Joe Manchin, one of two key Democratic holdouts on the filibuster said no one was going to be blocked from voting. “The laws are there, and the rules are there, and basically the government, the government will stand behind them and give them the right to vote,” Manchin said. “We act like we are going to obstruct people from voting; that is not going to happen.” Of course, there’s a mountain of evidence that cuts against all this. Election officials in Texas are rejecting an astronomically high number of absentee ballot requests after the state imposed new restrictions. After Georgia enacted new limits on the availability of drop boxes, the number of voters who used them dropped significantly. Republican lawmakers across the country are also redrawing electoral districts in a way that weakens the influence of Black, Hispanic, and Asian voters, especially in rapidly diversifying places. It’s an invisible form of voter suppression, but perhaps the most powerful, because the votes of those affected will matter less. I had this in mind when Senator Kyrsten Sinema, another Democratic holdout, argued on the Senate floor that passing voting rights legislation would not get at the underlying ills of political division in the US. It was a good line in her speech that just didn’t match up with reality. A provision in the Democratic voting rights bill prohibits severe partisan gerrymandering – something that would go a long way towards fostering more bipartisan compromise. At almost the same time the voting rights bill was taking place on Wednesday, the election board in Lincoln county, a rural and heavily GOP Georgia county near Augusta, was meeting to vote on a plan to close six of seven polling locations. Residents there have been organizing for weeks to block the move, saying that many in the county lack transportation and would have to drive far to get to the single polling location. The county says closing the polling places will save money and make it easier to administer elections. The plan stalled Wednesday evening, but it’s the type of thing that the federal government would have more oversight over if Democrats were able to pass their bill. “If it happens here and they’re successful, maybe we’re the pilot,” said the Rev Denise Freeman, a longtime resident who has been fighting the closures. “Maybe we’re the showcase for the rest of the world to disenfranchise voters so select people can stay in power.” I interviewed Martin Luther King III and his daughter Yolanda about what comes next in the fight for voting rights. Governor Ron DeSantis is proposing a massive new state agency to investigate election crimes, even though there’s little evidence of fraud in Florida. Preparations for the upcoming Texas primary are a bit of a mess as officials struggle to implement the state’s new voting restrictions. Officials have reported rejecting high percentages of mail-in ballot applications. The Ohio supreme court struck down GOP-drawn maps for both the state legislature and Congress, saying they were so partisan they violated the state constitution. Republicans in Virginia and Arizona have introduced a slew of new voter restrictions.

,,,"Republican presidential candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at a campaign event on Monday, Feb. 19, 2024, in Greer, S.C. (AP Photo / David Yeazell) KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley’s team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she’ll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Ahead of a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she’s staying in the race no matter what at least until after another 20 states vote through Super Tuesday on March 5. That’s even as Donald Trump’s MAGA movement is furious that she’s refusing to drop out. After all, she’s the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy ahead of the big speech. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: She’s Not Quitting Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press that she’s not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that’s even if she’s blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday’s South Carolina primary. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In case you don’t believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. She’s spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. The Losses May Pile Up Just don’t ask Haley which primary state she’s going to win. It’s a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren’t willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can’t. That’s because polls suggest she’s a major underdog in virtually every state — even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor — given Trump’s grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party’s most energized partisans — not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” she said. Still, Haley’s team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump — especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. Money Is Not a Problem Stop us if you’ve heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he’s betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump’s legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There’s also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren’t ready to surrender to Trump’s MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the altar of Donald Trump."" Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. Leaning Into Trump Legal Issues As Trump calls Haley names like “stupid” and “birdbrain,” Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president’s legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much — or more — time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump’s political standing would change dramatically if he’s a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal “piggy bank” for his legal fees. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” And she didn’t exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. “Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he’s going to have to defend himself,” she said in drawing a clear distinction. Long Term Outlook Hazy Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party’s July national convention. But Haley said she isn’t yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she’d drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party’s presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that’s likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she’d help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. “I don’t know what actions I’m gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,” Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn’t feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. “I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,"" Haley said. ""I’m running as a Republican. That’s my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.” Sign up for our morning newsletter to get all of our stories delivered to your mailbox each weekday.        65 comments · 10 minutes ago 13 comments · 3 hours ago 12 comments · 1 hour ago 116 comments · 3 hours ago ",news.wttw.com,https://news.wttw.com/2024/02/20/she-s-not-quitting-takeaways-nikki-haley-s-push-stay-gop-contest-against-donald-trump,
,,What Americans Don’t Know About Joe Biden,"“People know me,” the Democratic candidate for president likes to say. There’s a catch. He’s old. He worked with Barack Obama. He’s generally seen as a decent guy. If you know more than that about Joe Biden, you know more than many voters. Growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, or having to move because his father lost his job? Writing the Violence Against Women Act? The tragedies he’s lived through, his years as a single father, how he rode the train back to Delaware each night when he was a senator? Even his supposed vulnerabilities, like helping to write the 1994 crime bill, running the Anita Hill hearings, protecting Delaware’s financial industry, or blundering on foreign policy? Many Americans don’t know any of that, according to data from focus groups and polls conducted by Biden allies. For the past year, Biden’s been repeating that people know him. “The good news is the bad news. The good news is that people know me,” is his line. “And they know me warts and all,” he added on The Daily Show a few weeks ago. “The bad news is, they know me. [President Donald Trump] is not going to be able to make things stick that aren’t already real weaknesses on my part.” NEVER MISS A STORY. START YOUR FREE TRIAL. Uncompromising quality.

,,Biden cannot afford to lose a single Pennsylvania voter,"PHILADELPHIA — Northeast Philadelphia native Marc Rayfield is a registered Democrat, considers himself a liberal, and voted for Democrats John Fetterman (for Senate) and Josh Shapiro (for governor) in 2022 and for Joe Biden in 2020. Now, though, he says he finds himself estranged from the party due to rising crime and homelessness in his beloved city of Philadelphia. Because of his crime concerns, Rayfield is now doing something he thought he’d never do in his life: buying a gun and going to target practice. So is his wife. “I see what’s taken place in cities across the country,” said Rayfield, who is well respected in the community for his years of volunteer efforts for various Philadelphia organizations. “I travel a lot. I’ve been to every major city in the last year in the country.” Rayfield is a 60-year-old former executive at CBS News who took the skills he learned in the news business for over three decades into the organic spirit business as an entrepreneur. His new gun decision, he said, was “largely influenced by a lot of the social policies that are really impacting our cities coming out of the death of George Floyd and COVID.” “We decided, as somebody who had never fired a gun in my life, that it was about time to be open-minded and considerate,” he explained of taking gun safety lessons through a program that uses certified instructors. “The final straw was sort of seeing what’s taking place as a result of what’s going on in Gaza and how that’s impacting college campuses and the rise in antisemitism,” he said, adding, “It was the final straw, but not the first straw.” Rayfield is by no stretch of the imagination an uninformed voter. He says he knows what is at stake in this year’s presidential election, which is shaping up to be a rematch between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden, yet he finds himself unhappy with his choices thanks to issues such as crime and the southern border crisis. “Well, first of all, I would never vote for Trump, never, but I don’t feel great about Biden at all, and I would not vote for Kamala Harris,” he says definitively about all three. Rayfield says he is hoping for two things: either a third-party candidate emerges who would ensure Trump loses, or Biden dramatically deciding over the summer to bow out. “I’m hoping that maybe during the convention, he pulls the Lyndon Johnson and says that he’s not going to run again and they’ve already identified somebody, but I don’t even know who that person would be, but it would have to be anyone else but Biden and Harris,” he said. Pennsylvania is arguably once again the most important state in the country in determining who the next president will be. Trump narrowly won it in 2016, but Biden narrowly won it in 2020. If Biden wants to hold on to that narrow margin of victory, he cannot afford to lose one vote — in particular, voters such as Rayfield who is a reliable Democrat, lives in the Philly suburbs, and does not espouse the social justice requirements demanded of Biden from the progressive Left. Yet Biden has lost him. Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, says the reality is that neither Trump nor Biden has much of a margin of error in this evenly divided state. “It’s hard to imagine large shifts in the electorate short of a historic event,” Borick said. “Biden has a number of weak links in his coalition and while many of his 2020 voters wouldn’t flip to Trump, the lack of enthusiasm for Biden can translate into some voters taking a pass on the election or taking a flyer on a third-party candidate.” Rayfield isn’t the only part of the Biden coalition that is detaching from the president, who won the state by a single percentage point in 2020. A large chunk of that support came from black voters, 92% of whom chose Biden. Muhlenberg’s survey of voters in Pennsylvania in late December showed Biden only garnering the support of 52% of people of color while Trump was earning a solid 29%, an eye-popping number for a Republican presidential candidate.  The survey also showed that 65% of registered voters in Pennsylvania don’t believe Biden deserves to be reelected. Larry Ceisler, a Democratic Philadelphia-based public affairs professional, says Biden cannot afford to lose someone like Rayfield when the current president is facing his left flank saying they are not going to vote for Biden because Biden has not sided with the Palestinians in Gaza. “It could be a real problem,” said Ceisler, whose strategic communications experience is well respected across the state and nationally. “Neither Biden nor Trump can afford to lose votes because you look at the states that are going to be competitive, and you look at the last two elections, and you’re talking a handful of votes across all these states,” he said of states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia, all of which Biden won narrowly in 2020. “So while it bothers me that Biden is sort of pulling back on Israel, or at least talking a different game because he’s concerned about Michigan, and Trump is now sending out mixed messages on abortion, both candidates and their teams realize how tight things are, and if you tilt one way, then you take the chance of losing it on the other side,” he said. Ceisler was referring to Biden’s remark at a press conference 10 days ago in which he criticized Israel’s military operations in Gaza, saying “the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip, has been over the top.” Ceisler said if Biden goes too far in favor of the Palestinians, he loses legacy Democrats like Rayfield, but if he seems too supportive of Israel, he loses young social-justice-type voters. Losing too much of either group could open the door for a third-party candidate to earn support from former Biden voters. “It is unbelievable to me that they are willing to say, ‘OK, well, we’ll let Trump win, who is even going to be more supportive or more contrary to what we feel about Gaza and all the other things we care about are going to go down the drain,’” he said of young progressives who have voiced their decision to either stay home or vote for a third-party candidate. For example, this past Saturday, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) pleaded with Michigan Democrats to vote “uncommitted” in the state’s Feb. 27 primary rather than for Biden. Ceisler said this clamoring on the far Left of his party leads him to believe there are people and organizations on the Left that want Biden to lose, “because I think that they want to rid the Democratic Party of the influence that comes from sort of the establishment centrist part of the party.” Between 1996 and 2016, Pennsylvania was a reliable electoral win for Democratic presidential candidates, but it kept getting tighter every four years. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Case in point: Bill Clinton won 27 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties in 1996, but by 2012, Barack Obama had only won 13 of them. In 2016, Trump only needed to exceed Mitt Romney’s 2012 numbers in 10 rural counties by 2,000 votes each. That’s exactly what Trump did. In 2020, Trump lost some of those counties and narrowly lost the state. In 2024, Pennsylvania is up for grabs. But if Biden is losing middle-of-the-road suburban Democrats like Rayfield, then his problems are deeper than many realize.

Musk predicted his Neuralink Corp. would carry out its first brain implant later this year. , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk said he cannot envision himself voting for President Joe Biden in the 2024 election.  “I think I would not vote for Biden,” Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., said Wednesday at the New York Times Dealbook conference. He’d been asked if he could see himself casting a ballot for Biden in a hypothetical matchup with former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner. Asked if that meant he would vote for Trump, Musk demurred. “I’m not saying I’d vote for Trump,” he added with an audible sigh. “This is definitely a difficult choice here.” Musk has said he voted for Biden, a Democrat, in 2020 but the two men have had a contentious relationship since the president took office.  Earlier: Musk Says Ad Boycott on X May Kill It, Slings Expletives Biden has rarely mentioned Musk or Tesla, the world’s leading electric vehicle manufacturer, even when discussing issues involving the automobile industry or the administration’s efforts to promote EVs. Biden invited the chief executives of the Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. to the White House for an event in 2021 but did not extend an invitation to Tesla.  That rankled Musk, who cited the administration’s snub on Wednesday. Without “doing anything to provoke the Biden administration, they held an electric vehicle summit at the White House and specifically refused to let Tesla attend,” Musk said. “Biden went on to add insult to injury and publicly said GM was leading the electric car revolution.” Biden offered rare praise for Musk earlier this year, when the automaker opened part of Tesla’s charging network to other electric, a move the president called a “big deal.” “Thank you, Tesla is happy to support other EVs via our Supercharger network,” Musk replied in a post on X, then Twitter. He bought the social media company a year ago.  Since Biden has taken office, Musk has sought to court influence with Republicans and is a longtime donor to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He’s also offered praise for many of Biden’s political adversaries and encouraged the public to vote for a GOP Congress in the 2022 midterm elections.

,,Counterpoints,"     February 21, 2024  From time to time, people ask the question, “Why don’t you write about the Democrats for once?” Only on occasion do they complete the sentence with what they’re really thinking: “and all the stupid/terrible/ outrageous stuff they come up with.” All right, challenge accepted. Let’s go straight to the top on this one. There’s a cottage industry of pundits who insist on flogging the fantasy that Joe Biden will not be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024. Nikki Haley, who is about to be rendered politically irrelevant when she loses her home state of South Carolina in a rout to Donald Trump in the Feb. 24 GOP primary, has been on TV in recent days saying Republicans should leap at the chance to nominate her to run against Kamala Harris in November. To be fair, Harris does stand a marginally better chance (as in, highly remote) than Haley of carrying her party’s banner in the fall. So seeing Nikki working so hard to pump up Kamala as her rival isn’t the craziest thing in the world, since that honor already is reserved for the farcical notion that Haley and not Trump will be her party’s standard bearer in 2024. I’ve been saying it for some time now: America, get used to a Biden-Trump rematch. Apparently, judging from talk show gabfests and polling data, lots of people — maybe most people — haven’t yet gotten their heads around this electoral near-certainty. Sure, something could always happen to upend matters, but that’s been the human condition since time immemorial. You never know when the next meteor strike is just around the corner. The fascination with the idea that Democrats will field a late replacement for Biden springs from an immutable reality: Joe’s old. Perhaps you’ve seen a roundtable discussion about this on television. Lord, those 24-hour cable news hacks never shut up. (No matter how much you might wish otherwise.) Yes, to confirm what you already know, Joe Biden is 81 years old, he’ll be 86 at the end of his (prospective) second term, and since he doesn’t wear five layers of bronzer like Pancake Don, he looks older on television than some of his elderly peers (such as Trump, 3-1/2 years Biden’s junior) do. So yes, Biden being in his 80s is not ideal. If only someone could prevail upon the president to declare that his work in the White House is complete and it’s time for a new generation of leadership to carry forward the Democratic cause, starting with a vigorous young candidate for president who will take down Donald Trump once and for all. One can image the conversation: PARTY ELDERS: Good day Mr. President. JOE BIDEN: Great to see you fellas again in the White House. What can I do for you? ELDERS (not as elderly as BIDEN): Mr. President, we’re here to deliver a message that for the good of the country, it’s time for you to step aside as Democratic nominee for presi- (BIDEN presses red button under the Resolute Desk, Secret Service agents rush in, hustle visitors out of the Oval Office and White House and deposit them on their duffs on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.) Okay: as promised up top, let’s get to the stupid stuff that Dems (and their fellow travelers) do. What is the most disastrous decision by a prominent liberal figure in recent memory? There’s really no debate here: that would be the refusal by Ruth Bader Ginsburg to retire from the Supreme Court when she could have stepped down years earlier with a like-minded successor ready to take her place. Ginsburg is a liberal hero for her blistering dissents to some of the Supreme Court’s most egregious judicial rulings (it’s a long list), but Ginsburg also supplied the crucial fifth vote for the fragile majority that kept abortion legal despite an increasingly conservative court. When Ginsburg died in 2020 at age 87 (after a fifth cancer diagnosis), her seat went to an ardent foe of reproductive rights (Trump appointee Amy Coney Barrett) and Roe v. Wade, the decision that established a constitutional right to abortion a half-century earlier, was swept out to sea. In her stubborn insistence that she stay on the Supreme Court — call it hubris if you will — Ginsburg set in motion the repudiation of all she had stood for and fought for during an otherwise sterling lifetime of service. This same nightmare scenario hangs over Biden. What if, by dint of his sheer obstinacy, Trump regains the presidency? People forget sometimes what a disaster Trump was during his term of office (think bleach injected in the veins, Sharpies and hurricane storm paths, the family separation policy and you’ve only scratched the surface.) If Trumps somehow gets back to the White House, you might as well get used to bumbling incompetence, smash-and-grab thievery and corruption and tyrannical excess becoming the wallpaper of your everyday life. (If you live in Europe, having the Russian army show up at your border is also a strong possibility with Putin’s number-one fanboy laying down in the White House.) Whatever you think Joe Biden is bad at, Donald Trump would be far worse. But will voters see it that way come November? Biden’s advanced age, coupled with his poor polling, would seem to invite a challenge from within his own party. Yet no serious challenger has stepped forward. Lifelong grifter and nepo baby Robert F. Kennedy Jr. originally launched a bid for the Democratic nomination, but his candidacy was so transparently a right-wing put-up job that he has since gone the independent route. (Some polling suggests that Kennedy, whose anti-vax advocacy is his main calling card, might actually help Biden’s re-election fortunes by stealing votes away from Donald Trump.) An obscure Democratic congressman from Minnesota, Dean Phillips, entered the Democratic race after declaring Biden too old to do the job, and he just got under 20 percent of the primary vote in New Hampshire (where Biden wasn’t even on the ballot as a write-in candidate) and 2 percent in South Carolina (the first officially sanctioned party primary). Phillips is young, moderate, handsome, and the type of candidate that pundits yearn for when calling for an alternative to Biden. Yet Democratic voters aren’t biting. Why not? Here’s a simple theory, and one that, contrary to exposing the folly of the Democratic electorate in general and Joe Biden specifically, actually speaks to a mature view of politics as a team sport. Intraparty challenges to sitting presidents never go well for the party in charge. Examples abound (Ted Kennedy taking on Jimmy Carter in 1980, Pat Buchanan primarying George H.W. Bush in 1992) but you don’t need to resort to history to understand that a house divided cannot stand. Biden is intent on running for re-election, he is broadly acceptable to most all of the factions that make up the sprawling Democratic Party, and that’s pretty much all there is to say on the matter. Once again, back to our premise: is this smart politics, or stupidity borne of mass delusion by the Democratic grassroots and party bigfoots alike? Barring the unexpected, we’ll know the answer in November. Biden-Trump II is shaping up to be a close race, no question about it, and pinning one’s hopes on an unpopular incumbent with age issues is the epitome of a high stakes gamble. (I’m perhaps more forgiving of Joe Biden’s memory lapses than most seeing as how I can’t find my car keys at least four times a week.) One thing about Biden, though, is that he is easy to underrate. He’s never been a great orator, he was gaffe-prone as a much younger man, and it took him three tries before he ascended to the White House. Yet his record of enacting momentous legislation is greater than any of his successors going back to Lyndon Johnson. His overall record is one filled with accomplishment: record job growth, historically low unemployment, an expanding economy, wages rising faster than inflation (which has come way down after a post-pandemic runup of prices), and falling poverty and budget deficits. On the international front, Biden has realigned U.S. foreign policy to check Chinese ambitions in the South Pacific, he has strengthened our democratic alliances, and most importantly, he’s been a champion of Ukraine in its battle for survival in the face of a murderous, unprovoked war launched by Vladimir Putin. Even Biden’s perceived weaknesses are mostly a bum rap: Biden played a key role in recent bipartisan negotiations to secure the border (the lead Republican in those talks, Oklahoma senator James Lankford, is as conservative as they come) only to see the resulting bill fail due to opposition by MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives. (The raw immigration numbers under Biden also don’t differ all that much from those of the Trump Administration.) On another front where Biden has drawn criticism — the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan — what rarely goes said is that the U.S spent 20 years in that woebegone country failing to build a stable government, and the president who pulled the plug on this hopeless experiment was always going to encounter trouble at the end. Did you know that the U.S. evacuated 122,000 people from Kabul before the fall to the Taliban? I did not until recently. These actions, and this president’s record, speak to a broadly competent record of governance that will go up in flames if Trump regains the White House. Would another, younger Democrat be a better choice for the party in November? Maybe, but that’s not the choice on the table. This is a far different situation than the Ruth Bader Ginsburg disaster, when liberals had a chance to secure a seat on the court with an engineered appointment, which does not describe 2024’s reality. We don’t know if a different candidate would run a better race than Biden — age does, after all, come with advantages. Biden is tried and tested and has a record that he can defend, and arguments he can credibly run on. The most important is the one he rode to victory in 2020: Donald Trump is a serial criminal and an aspiring autocrat whose candidacy represents a dire threat to American democracy and to the world, and he must be stopped. Writing this week in the New York Times, Ezra Klein observes that Biden has held together a Democratic Party that could easily have splintered. Think back to the 2020 campaign, when he beat Bernie Sanders, when he beat Elizabeth Warren, when his victory was seen as, was in reality, the moderate wing triumphing over the progressive wing, the establishment over the insurgents. But instead of making them bend the knee, instead of acting as a victor, Biden acted as a leader. He partnered with Bernie Sanders. He built the unity task forces. He integrated Warren’s and Sanders’s ideas and staff into not just his campaign but also his administration. I had a conversation recently with Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House progressive caucus, and I asked her why the Democratic Party hadn’t ruptured the way Republicans did. She pointed me back to that moment. Biden, she said, made this “huge attempt to pull the Democratic Party back together before the 2020 election in a way I’ve really never seen before.” And it worked. Democrats had 50 votes in the Senate. Fifty votes that stretched from Bernie Sanders on the left all the way to Joe Manchin on the right. Biden and Chuck Schumer, they often could not lose even one of those votes, and at crucial moments, they didn’t. With that almost-impossible-to-hold-together coalition, the Biden administration and congressional Democrats passed a series of bills — the bipartisan infrastructure deal, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act — that will make this a decade of infrastructure and invention. A decade of building, of decarbonizing, of researching. They expanded the Affordable Care Act, and it worked — more than 21 million people signed up for the A.C.A. last year, a record. They did what Democrats have promised to do forever and took at least the first steps toward letting Medicare negotiate drug prices. And the Biden team, they said they were going to run the economy hot, that at long last, they were going to prioritize full employment, and they did. And then inflation shot up. Not just here but in Europe, in Canada, pretty much everywhere. The pandemic had twisted global supply chains and then the economy had reopened, and people desperate to live again took their pandemic savings and spent. And the Biden team, in partnership with Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve, got the rate of inflation back down, and we are still beneath 4 percent unemployment. And I don’t want to just skip over that accomplishment. Most economists said that could not be done. The overwhelming consensus was we were headed for a recession, that the so-called soft landing was a fantasy. It got mocked as “immaculate disinflation.” But that is what happened. We didn’t have a recession. We are still seeing strong wage gains for the poorest Americans. Inequality is down. Growth is quick. America is far stronger economically right now than Europe, than Canada, than China. You want to be us …. Yes, you do. Instead of leaving matters there, Klein proceeds to go off on an unhelpful tangent about how Democrats should and can replace Biden on the ticket. Maybe editorial flights of fantasy attract more eyeballs than just another reality-based opinion piece on how Republicans are utterly unable to govern, but it’s also a fundamentally dumb take that shows naivety by our supposed media sharpies. Keep it simple, stupid really can be the best advice.     Your email address will not be published.

,,Letter: Backing Biden is the only way to avoid Trump dictatorship,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        Regarding the letter to the editor, “Even for a Democrat, watching Biden has become painful” (Feb. 14): Quite apart from the partisan, unwarranted assessment of Robert Hur, a Republican, that President Joe Biden is a well-meaning elderly man with poor memory, it is true that Biden owns his share of gaffes — as does Donald Trump, who is almost as old as Biden. However, the reality is Biden will be the Democratic presidential nominee. The election is less than nine months away and there is no other serious Democratic candidate. To suggest that Biden bow out is not realistic and for him to do so would be tantamount to handing Trump the presidency. There is no solace in the hope that Trump’s legal issues will “sideline” him in his quest for the presidency. It is quite possible that none of the cases now pending would be tried by the election. Even if he were to be convicted, he could still win at the ballot box because his supporters are blind to his corruption and loyal to a fault. Trump has already indicated he would terminate parts of the U.S. Constitution. If elected, what would prevent him from setting aside any convictions against himself? The fact is that the 2024 presidential election will present a choice between Biden (democracy) and Trump (autocracy). Those who choose to abstain from casting a vote or vote for a third-party candidate are paving the way for a Trump victory at the ballot box. Stephen J. Sexauer Crestwood    On this edition of Inside the Race Weekend, Politico White House Reporter Myah Ward and Politico Politics Reporter Brittany Gibson join Scripps News National Political correspondents, Haley Bull and Charles Benson, and host, Joe St. George to discuss if this presidential race may see a rise in popularity of third-party or independent candidates. With Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulling big numbers in Wisconsin in the latest polls, Benson highlighted the battleground states history with third-party candidates. Gibson, who specifically covers third-party candidates, said Kennedy has been polling better than a lot of recent third-party campaigns. One of his interesting strategies is focusing more on podcast interviews instead of traditional media interviews with local news outlets. Another big topic right now is the age of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Bidens memory was recently questioned after a report from Special Counsel Robert Hur claimed the 81-year-old president didnt remember when he was vice president or when his son Beau died of brain cancer.Bull said Biden has forcefully fought back against the claims his memory isnt good. Ward said it could make some voters stay home, with a lack of enthusiasm for candidates that dont connect with younger voters.

,,"I Love You, Please Vote For Biden"," If you’ve ever had a family Thanksgiving turn nuclear after Aunt Helen decided to share her opinion on All Lives Matter during the dessert course, you know it can be extremely difficult to change your loved ones’ minds about deeply held political views. But talking about these subjects with close friends and family doesn’t always lead to slammed screen doors and smashed pie plates. Sometimes these relationships provide a way into perspective-shifting conversations that might otherwise be impossible. “There is someone in your life that only you can get through to,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “I need you to use your relationships to get through and check in on people and make sure they’re stepping up and doing the right thing, and they’re not staying home on Election Night, and they’re not giving their vote to Donald Trump.” The Cut talked to seven people about how they got through to that person in their lives — from jaded nonvoters to disillusioned Republicans — and convinced them to cast their vote for Joe Biden this fall. As 15-year-old Claire said of getting her Republican grandma in Florida to vote for Biden, that personal closeness can make all the difference: “She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true.” Interviews have been edited for length and clarity, and names have been changed. My dad used to be a Republican congressman. Our family always grew up pretty conservative, though it sure feels, as I get older, I’m becoming more liberal, especially with Trump in power. I think Trump is an absolute menace. There’s no way I would ever have voted for him. In 2016, I did a write-in for John Kasich, but this year I’m voting for Biden. My brother’s a retired banker down in Dallas, and he’s ten years older than me. He’s a conservative Republican, he’s a loyal soldier for the party, but he also believes Trump is a moron. He knew he wasn’t gonna vote for Trump this time; he was planning to write in Reagan’s name. And I just started pleading with him, saying, “Texas is in play. The state is so close. And if the Republicans can lose Texas, maybe that’s a wake-up call for them to get their act together.” The Republicans are pulling out every dirty trick they can to suppress voting and try and save this guy’s bacon. And I said, “You can’t just vote for Reagan or Ross Perot and feel good about it.” We talk probably three times a week on the phone, if not more. His wife is also a conservative Republican, and she can’t stand Trump, like me. She and I weren’t plotting together, but it was definitely a tag-team effort. I think my brother’s a smart guy. He’s not a fan of Joe Biden [politically], but he believes he’s a decent human being and a good man. And I think he knows that the country’s in a bad place right now and we do have to put country over party. I live in rural Pennsylvania. It’s very red, and I was a big Trump supporter in 2016 when I was in high school. As the years went on, I started to drift away, and I finally turned and got on the Bidenmobile in about September. COVID-19 was kind of the final straw for me. Other countries have beaten this back, and we’re climbing like crazy. I also personally feel like, as someone who studies climate change and someone who is LGBTQ, another four years with Donald Trump in the White House is not the best for a person like me. When I first supported Trump, I did not realize I was LGBTQ, and I wasn’t nearly as much of an environmentalist as I am now. My boyfriend and I met in 2019 and started dating this spring. He had been a Trump supporter but was increasingly on the fence, and he was starting to show the early signs of getting annoyed with Trump’s rhetoric. Still, he said he wasn’t going to break his back going to the polls, but if he did manage to go, he was gonna vote Trump, just do a straight red ticket. And then that’s when I kind of threw a lot of persuasion at him. It started as a little bit of joking banter, like, “Vote for Biden and I’ll buy you this.” And then eventually, I kind of got to him. I helped him realize that, of the two main options available, Biden was the lesser of two evils. I said, “Do you want to spend the next four years reading angry tweets and opening up Twitter and saying, ‘Oh, what did Trump do now?’” I think the first debate also really helped convince him because Trump spent the entire time attacking Joe Biden’s son and Joe Biden as a person, and I think he felt that Biden at least portrayed an ounce of professionalism that was desperately needed. He kind of just said, “Fine, finally I get it, I’ll do it.”  My son is in the National Guard; he’s 21. He’s like a lot of people in that generation, where they think it doesn’t really matter. He’s pretty progressive, he supported Bernie, and none of his friends are voting, because they don’t like Biden either. But he’s been activated four times now during COVID, for protests in Seattle and for COVID relief, doing testing and food banks, and he’ll be activated for the election, for whatever may or may not happen. In encouraging him to vote, I said, “Remember, you’re also voting for your boss, because we also have a tight gubernatorial race.” I told him, you know, “If we get a conservative governor here, that guy is gonna activate you every time somebody breathes wrong.” He doesn’t want to be at those protests; if he had his way, he’d likely be on the other side of them. I’ve voted in every election since I turned 18, but this is his first presidential election. It’s hard to convey to him how different this election is from any other during my lifetime, and he really doesn’t have the luxury of standing idly by, waiting for a better candidate. He got his ballot, and I was like, “Are you gonna fill it out?” I said, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, but this is why I really want you to vote for Biden.” And he did it. My grandma lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She has been a Republican pretty much her whole life, but she did not agree with what Trump was doing with COVID, because she’s older and she’s immunocompromised. I FaceTime her every Sunday for about an hour. A year ago, we didn’t really talk about politics. But in the past couple months, I’ve been trying to incorporate it a little bit more because I had a feeling that she wasn’t going to vote. I tried to show her that not everyone has benefited from Trump being president. For example, she is upper class, and my mom and dad and brother are not, and I kind of showed her that not taxing everyone equally is not effective. And she said she never thought about how taxing the upper class would be helpful to everybody else. Especially with Black Lives Matter becoming bigger this year, I think she also realized that racism is a really big problem. Where she lives, it’s mostly white people, and she hasn’t lived with other minorities in a really long time. And I started explaining the protests and how police were targeting Black people, because I don’t think she really understood. Recently, she told me that she was going to vote for Biden because she believes Trump is evil and it’s the right thing to do, not only thinking about herself but thinking about everybody. It was awesome.
Me and her have gotten really close. And I think that us being really close really helped me convince her, because she trusts me and respects my opinion. She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true. I tried to get my dad to vote blue in 2016. I don’t think that worked — he still hasn’t really said who he voted for, but I think he has pretty much always voted Republican. Since then, anytime I thought Trump did something dumb, I would try to start a conversation, and that didn’t really work. But as this election got closer, I was really trying to tell him about how important it would be for my future and potentially my kids’ future if I have kids. Millennials have this idea that it’s not ethical to necessarily bring kids into the world when there are politicians in office that don’t believe in climate change. He thought that idea was really out there, and he said he couldn’t believe I thought that way. He thought that’s kind of a crazy way to think about having kids, like it doesn’t really matter who’s in office, you’re gonna live your life. Marrying those things together, I think, was probably a new concept for him. He did definitely push back and say that’s not the way to think about having kids, and I said, “Well, that’s the way that I’m thinking about it, and you could help with this if you voted for Biden. That would be a step in the right direction.”   While he was never interested in talking about me having grandkids before, the past few years he has kind of been asking me what’s going on. Prior to that, I would have never thought that could be a way in. My mom sent me a photo of his completed ballot [for Biden]; he wouldn’t send it to me. I think he’s still begrudgingly doing it, and that doesn’t feel great, but I guess a win’s a win. The majority of my family is completely out of touch with politics. They don’t understand how policies and the people we elect can affect their lives. They just tend to complain. My sister hasn’t voted in over 30 years. She does watch TV, but because Trump has so dominated the airwaves, she’s just sick and tired of it. She was just frustrated by his childish behavior. And I said, “Let’s do something about it. You need to go vote.” And she’s like, “Dan, I haven’t voted in years, and I’m blind.” She actually went blind this past year because of diabetes, and she’s only gone blind in the last six or seven months so she’s still struggling with how to live this way. So I printed off the Missouri absentee ballot application and sent her hard copies of it, and I walked her through the ballot and explained how to get it submitted in Missouri and all that. And because I went to the effort to make it easier for her, she was motivated to follow through, but I did have to lead her every step of the way. Miranda and I have been friends since we were next-door neighbors in second grade. We can talk about anything without being judgmental. I’ve always called her my one Republican friend, and she’s always called me her tree-hugging friend. Politics was never a major topic of discussion for us. Of course, Trump has changed that. I sort of explained to her what’s happening around the world and showed how fascism and authoritarianism are rising up everywhere, like Hungary, Poland, Brazil, Turkey, India, and I started naming off all the countries that have fallen to authoritarian regimes over the last decade and kind of brought it back home. One of my children has Jewish heritage, and one of my children has Muslim heritage and I sort of explained to her how terrified I am for them. We’re applying, through my husband, for Italian citizenship. That’s how scared we are. I think that sort of brought it home to a personal level. I remember we were talking about race issues, and I tried to explain it very simply. I said, “Miranda, do you think that you would have the same life if you had been born to the same parents and lived in the same house next door to me and everything was the same except you were Black instead of white?” And I think she was able to realize that no, she wouldn’t have had the same life — like my parents back then wouldn’t have let me be friends with her. I come from a very racist family, and things wouldn’t have been the same. I feel like if I were to go to a Trump supporter that I ran into who didn’t love me, it’s futile for me to waste my breath trying to convince them of anything. But Miranda knows me, and I feel like you can convince the people that love you. Really the only way I’ve been able to reach people is “If you believe this is happening, or if you believe it could be happening, and if you love me, don’t you care about what that’s gonna mean?” Because our family, I feel like, is in a particularly vulnerable spot. That’s how I got through to her.   Limited-time offer: Join today and get two free gifts — our new Cut tote and the Spring Fashion Issue.

,,Which Republican Candidate Should Biden Be Most Afraid Of?,"2024 ELECTION A FiveThirtyEight Chat MAY 2, 2023, AT 6:00 AM Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited. ameliatd (Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux, senior reporter): It’s finally official: President Biden is running for reelection. After months of teasing a potential bid for a second term, he dropped a prerecorded video on April 25 saying that his 2024 campaign has officially begun. In that announcement, Biden started to make his own pitch for another four years. “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom. More rights or fewer,” he said in the video. And while he didn’t name any rivals, pictures of Republican opponents — like former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — flashed on the screen as he spoke. Without a serious primary challenger (yet, anyway), potential GOP opponents are clearly on Biden’s mind. But the Republican primary is just getting off the ground. So let’s talk about which potential GOP candidate would be Biden’s most formidable opponent. Which Republican, even if they haven’t officially announced yet — looking at you, DeSantis — has the best chance of beating Biden, based on what we know now? kaleigh (Kaleigh Rogers, politics reporter): Here’s my hot take for 2024: Biden has a better shot against some of the front-runners like Trump and DeSantis than against one of the currently-less-hot candidates. He’s an incumbent candidate whose approval rating is nothing to write home about, even among Democrats. There’s a serious risk of Democrats feeling apathetic about this election, especially if the candidate is someone they assume Biden will beat. But if Trump or DeSantis is the nominee, the prospect of one of those candidates winning could be enough to scare Democrats into showing up at the polls. For better or worse, polarization means our elections are as much about whom voters don’t want as much as they are about whom they do want: One survey found that as many as one-third of voters in 2020 said they were voting against a candidate rather than for the one they chose. Biden may benefit if he’s running against someone whom Democrats view as a threat. ameliatd: ÑÐÐÑÐÑâÐÐÐÑÒÐÑ take, Kaleigh! What do you think, Geoffrey and Nathaniel? RECOMMENDED POLITICS The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now     nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior elections analyst): Oh, interesting, Kaleigh! I was thinking about this question in terms of Trump versus DeSantis. But that’s probably too closed-minded of me. Although it would be a pretty huge upset for someone polling as low as former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to win the GOP nomination, it’s very possible they would be stronger general-election candidates than either Trump or DeSantis because they are more temperamentally moderate. kaleigh: Right, and I think a more moderate candidate comes with a dual risk: Democratic voters will either think Biden can beat a moderate, or they’re OK with the possibility that he won’t. nrakich: In fact, I’ll go a step further and say that, of the candidates in the race right now, Haley would be the strongest general-election candidate. There is credible daylight between her and Trump(ism) on issues like election denialism (she criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol). And fairly or not, the fact that she’s a woman of color would likely make her seem more moderate. Political science research tells us that Republican women, especially women of color, are perceived as more moderate than conservative, which can be a problem in primaries but a potential help in general elections. geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, senior elections analyst): That all makes sense to me. However, while it’s early, there is only a small chance that someone besides Trump or DeSantis wins the GOP presidential nomination. We know early primary polls are actually fairly predictive, so to have those two candidates so far ahead of the rest of the field at this point makes it hard — though not impossible — to see anyone else facing Biden. So the question, to Nathaniel’s point, is mostly about which of those two has a better chance of defeating Biden.  ameliatd: OK, so if we’re talking about which candidate with a realistic shot of actually being the nominee has the best chance of beating Biden — who is it? Trump or DeSantis? And yes, I know DeSantis isn’t officially in the race yet — but let’s assume he is. nrakich: I think it’s DeSantis. He managed to win reelection in Florida last year by 20 points! That was very impressive; Florida has a FiveThirtyEight partisan lean of only R+7. And yes, I know he was running against a flawed candidate in Democratic former Rep. Charlie Crist, but that’s likely only part of the story. In addition, virtually all evidence indicates that Trump is a big electoral drag on his own, and for the GOP. He won in 2016 only by the skin of his teeth, and that was against a historically unpopular Democratic candidate in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  And then, of course, he lost in 2020 to Biden, who will likely be his (or DeSantis’s) opponent again in 2024. And the candidates he endorsed did really poorly in the 2022 general election, too. An analysis from The Economist estimated that they did 5 percentage points worse than a non-Trump-endorsed candidate would have.  geoffrey.skelley: I tend to agree that DeSantis is a somewhat better bet against Biden than Trump. He’s not as well-known as Trump and he tends to have a better net favorability rating among Republicans than the former president in most polls, usually because fewer Republicans have a negative opinion of DeSantis. If he can maintain that favorability edge even as he becomes better-known, DeSantis could wind up doing a better job of retaining most Republican support in the general election, whereas Trump’s controversial record could result in him losing a small number of Republicans to Biden — and in a close election, that could matter. Additionally, Trump polls quite poorly among independents, so DeSantis could be a chance for the GOP to get a fresh start with this group. I’m not sure how much better than Trump he could do — to Kaleigh’s earlier point, high levels of polarization have made this a game of inches when it comes to substantially shifting the electorate toward one party or the other. But I do think DeSantis is likely to perform better than Trump. kaleigh: Totally. The reality is that Biden beat Trump once before, and I’m not convinced anything has shifted in Trump’s favor since then. In fact, I think things look worse for Trump. Jan. 6 poured a lot of cold water on the MAGA movement, and the scandals that have followed (the multiple investigations, the indictment, the mishandled classified documents), while temporarily boosting good will for Trump among Republicans, may make GOP voters ultimately see him as too much of a liability. nrakich: I do want to reemphasize Geoffrey’s point about polarization, though. When we’re talking about which candidate is more “electable,” chances are their advantage is only a couple percentage points. Though, in a close election, that could matter … ameliatd: But, OK — what happens to Trump’s enthusiastic fan base within the GOP if DeSantis wins? Is it possible they just don’t turn out for DeSantis? geoffrey.skelley: DeSantis is very Trumpy. I don’t think they’re going to have much trouble turning out for him against Biden. Granted, we don’t know what Trump would do if he lost the GOP nomination — he might hold a serious grudge and try to actively undermine his party’s campaign. kaleigh: A lot of Trump’s loyalists would likely pivot and rally behind DeSantis. He has enough of the anti-woke bona fides to scratch that itch for the MAGA base. But I think some will drop off. Trump inspired a meaningful number of nonvoters to turn out to the polls for the first time in years, and many of those voters may fall back out of the electorate if the GOP candidate lacks the fiery charisma of Trump.  And on the flip side, Geoff, if Trump rallies behind DeSantis (not his typical M.O. but he’s nothing if not surprising), that could be all the boost DeSantis needs to secure the base after the primary. nrakich: Yeah, despite Trump’s attacks on DeSantis, Trump primary voters so far still have a strongly positive opinion of the Florida governor. According to Morning Consult, 47 percent of Trump voters identified DeSantis as their second choice for president. Only 27 percent identified a different candidate, and the actual “never-DeSantis” crowd is probably even smaller than that.  Also, just in general, the idea that dissatisfied primary voters don’t end up voting for their party’s nominee in the end is overrated. Almost all of them will end up voting for the GOP nominee just to stop Biden. For example, in the 2008 exit polls, 89 percent of Democrats said they voted for former President Barack Obama even after his bruising primary fight with Clinton that year. That number (around 90 percent) is pretty typical in terms of same-party vote share. ameliatd: But what happens if DeSantis goes so far right in the primary that he’s in basically the same position as Trump with independents? I am going to force one of you to take Trump seriously as a contender against Biden! geoffrey.skelley: Oh, it’s not that we don’t take Trump seriously. He could very well defeat Biden. I just think there’s good reason to see DeSantis as having a higher ceiling than Trump in a general election. nrakich: Yeah, Amelia, I do think that could happen. DeSantis isn’t even in the race yet. I’m just talking about where things stand right now. But I do think DeSantis would have to do a lot of extreme stuff to develop a brand as toxic with independents as Trump’s. That said, he has been working overtime to develop that uber-conservative record. The type of six-week abortion ban that he recently signed into law, for example, is unpopular nationwide. (According to a recent Fox News poll, 52 percent of Americans would oppose a six-week abortion ban in their state, and only 44 percent would support it.) And if abortion remains as big an issue in 2024 as it was in 2022, that could put him behind the eight ball. kaleigh: Yeah, I think we’re all trying to choose between three not-particularly-stellar candidates, and this early in the game, there’s a case to be made for Trump, Biden or DeSantis coming out on top. ameliatd: OK, so let’s talk about Trump. What would have to happen for him to be a stronger contender against Biden than DeSantis? Because Nathaniel’s right — it’s early, and DeSantis is unproven on the national stage. geoffrey.skelley: DeSantis certainly does have plenty of potential negatives. He may go so far to the right with an eye on the primary that he’ll be vulnerable in a general election. So even if he might be a better pick for the GOP than Trump, the differences here are not necessarily that large. And some might turn to the polls to argue Trump is stronger. I took an average of general election polls of registered or likely voters in April, and on average Trump’s margin against Biden was a couple of points better than DeSantis’s. However, we also know that Trump has basically universal name recognition, whereas DeSantis is well known but not to the extent Trump is. As a result, surveys asking about the Florida governor tend to have more undecideds, which may be aiding Trump in this comparison. Moreover, while primary polls conducted in the first half of the year before the election have some predictive power, general election polls at this point are not worth very much. It’s not usually until the spring of the election year that general election polls start to have meaningful explanatory power for the eventual November outcome, which makes sense: That’s about the time we start to get a firmer idea of what the general election matchup could look like. And given the small margins in most recent elections, even minor swings closer to November could matter, so there’s still a long way to go. kaleigh: Part of it could come down to the campaign itself. Biden is 80. He’ll turn 81 late this year. He’s not the same candidate he was in 2020. If his campaign isn’t energetic enough, it could prompt voters to stay home or even feel willing to give Trump another shot, especially if Trump is campaigning well and avoiding some of the bigger gaffes of past elections. Again, we’re talking about slim margins here that could make the difference. geoffrey.skelley: Right, to Kaleigh’s point, there are also a bunch of unknowns, like the state of the economy, scandals, war and other factors that could influence the trajectory of the general election later. nrakich: Yes, Kaleigh, I think that’s a key point. According to a YouGov/Yahoo News poll from February, 68 percent of registered voters said Biden is too old to start another term as president. But Trump himself is 76! Meanwhile, DeSantis is only 44 years old, he has a young family, etc. I know this is super pundit-y, but given how unpredictive the early polls are at this stage, I think it’s as good a theory as any: The age contrast between DeSantis and Biden could benefit DeSantis in a general election. geoffrey.skelley: That seems possible, Nathaniel, although Biden could come out firing in a debate with the line Ronald Reagan used in 1984 against Walter Mondale (who was in his mid-50s but still 17 years younger than Reagan): “I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” kaleigh: A classic debate zinger! geoffrey.skelley: Reagan was the last president to face serious questions about his age and mental acuity, so the comparison to Biden seems apt. kaleigh: And, compared to 80-year-old Biden and 76-year-old Trump, Reagan was a spry 73 at the time! ameliatd: So it sounds like one big question mark here is Biden himself. And he’ll have to run a very different campaign than he did in 2020 — simply because we were deeply in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic then, and nobody could campaign. But what do Republican voters think? Do they view one candidate as more electable than the other? nrakich: Yes, Amelia, so far, Republican voters think Trump is more electable than DeSantis! According to Morning Consult, 54 percent of potential GOP primary voters think Trump has the best chance of beating Biden, while only 25 percent said DeSantis. I don’t know if that’s because of name recognition, or because many Republican voters still believe Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 election, or some other reason, but it’s definitely the opposite of what I would have expected. geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, Nathaniel. It’s also not clear how much electability even matters to Republican voters. Polls have varied, but a March survey from CNN found that 59 percent of Republicans and independents who leaned Republican said they preferred a candidate who agreed with them on the issues, compared with 41 percent who preferred one who had a strong chance of defeating Biden. Meanwhile, 63 percent of Republican adults told YouGov/The Economist in mid-April that agreeing with a candidate on the issues was more important than their chances in the general election; only 23 percent said the latter was more critical.  However, another mid-April poll from Impact Research and Fabrizio, Lee & Associates on behalf of the Wall Street Journal found 51 percent preferred a candidate with the best chance of winning the general even if they disagreed on some issues versus 44 percent who wanted to agree with the candidate on everything even if the candidate would have a tougher time winning in November. The wording and results in these polls differ to some extent, but regardless, there definitely isn’t a huge majority of Republicans who are prioritizing winning over the issues. nrakich: An interesting strategy from a party that is in real danger of losing four of the last five presidential elections!

,,"Ahead of South Carolina primary, Nikki Haley vows to stay in the race until ‘the last person votes’"," Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday reiterated her plans to continue her White House bid against former President Donald Trump, just five days ahead of the South Carolina Primary. “Some of you—perhaps a few of you in the media—came here today to see if I’m dropping out of the race. Well, I’m not. Far from it,” Haley said in a speech in Greenville.   Haley vowed she is not exiting the race now, saying she will continue to compete in the primary past the South Carolina primary and through Super Tuesday on March 5. “That’s why I refuse to quit. South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I’ll still be running for president. I’m not going anywhere,” she said. “I’m campaigning every day, until the last person votes, because I believe in a better America and a brighter future for our kids.” Haley’s remark come as she continues to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination, though he has won every delegate contest so far and holds a wide lead over Haley in her own home state, making many question the path forward for the former governor’s campaign. Haley had previously said that she had to do better in the South Carolina primary than she did in New Hampshire primary – where she lost to Trump by 11 points – but she is no longer saying that she must hit that goal. Polls consistently show Haley trailing Trump in South Carolina by a considerable margin. According to the latest new CBS/YouGov survey, Trump leads Haley among likely voters in South Carolina’s upcoming Republican primary, 65% to 30%. Those results echo previous Monmouth University-Washington Post polling, which also found Trump taking majority support. Haley made her case for staying in the race by pointing to a number of factors, including her view that some politicians who embrace Trump publicly “privately dread him.” “Look, I get it. In politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong. A lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it… Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party. They’re just too afraid to say it out loud,” Haley said. Haley said that her “own political future is of zero concern” and said that she plans to stay in the race for “something bigger” than herself, saying Americans have the right to have their voices heard at the polls. “They deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don’t rig elections!,” she said. Haley also said she has “a handful of serious concerns” about Trump but has “countless serious concerns” about Biden. Her remarks differ from her previous comments in New Hampshire, when she told CNN’s Dana Bash that Trump and Biden are “equally bad” for Americans. The Trump campaign sought to undercut Haley’s message by releasing a memo hours before Haley’s speech, arguing their calculations show Trump will earn the number of delegates needed to become the Republican nominee by March 19 at the latest and that Haley’s campaign was “out of gas.” “The true ‘state’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign? Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump,” Trump campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in the memo. The memo reads, “Nikki Haley’s campaign ends Saturday, February 24th, fittingly, in her home state, rejected by those who know her the best.” Trump has been in South Carolina for a single event since the New Hampshire primary and he will be back in the state on Tuesday night for a town hall with Fox News. Pitching herself as the best alternative to both President Joe Biden and Trump, Haley again painted both leaders as ”two old men who are only getting older,” and accused them both of polarizing the country. “The truth is, Americans already know what Joe Biden and Donald Trump will do. But we’re just as concerned with who they are. They’re dividers at a time when America desperately, urgently, needs a uniter,” Haley said as she continued to offer a message of unity. “In the America I know and love, we disagree strongly, but we do it without hating each other, and we still have a shared national purpose. In the America I know and love, we respect freedom and the rule of law, we refuse to use the awesome power of big government to punish those we dislike, and we recognize that America has done more good for more people than any country in the world.” Haley’s speech ended on a visibly emotional note as she highlighted her husband’s current deployment with the South Carolina Army National Guard. “As I prepare for what lies ahead, Michael is at the front of my mind. I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight. But we can’t,” Haley said, as she began tearing up. Haley often talks about her husband’s military service on the campaign trail – especially after that service was mocked by Trump, who recently questioned his whereabouts – but she does not routinely tear up when she reflects on his service. “Michael is fighting for the country he loves. So are all his brothers- and sisters-in-arms, wherever they’re stationed in our dangerous world. They have made their stand because America is worth fighting and even dying for. Now I will continue to make my stand because America is worth living for,” she added. CNN’s Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.

,,Trump or Haley? What latest SC Republican polls say about who's leading ahead of primary,"South Carolinians will cast their ballots in the Republican presidential primary Saturday, and despite candidate Nikki Haley’s prior tenure as the state’s governor, polls point to former President Donald Trump as the likely victor. A February poll led by Suffolk University/USA TODAY published Tuesday morning showed that 63% likely South Carolina Republican primary voters surveyed plan to vote for Trump, while only 35% plan to vote for Haley. The poll was conducted between Feb. 15-18 and included 500 responses. A larger poll conducted between Feb. 13-15 of likely Republican primary voters in the state led by partisan Trafalgar Group also reported that 63% of responders said they plan to support Trump, compared to less than 34% who said they plan to support Haley. Voting in SC's Republican primary?How to check registration, where to vote. Both candidates made appearances in the Upstate this week ahead of the weekend’s primary. Still, polling among Upstate residents specifically shows support for Trump. Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide A poll from The Citadel School of Humanities and Social Sciences included a breakdown of likely South Carolina Republican voters by region. Residents in the Upstate were more likely than residents on the coast or in the Midlands to say they’d vote for Trump in the primary. Elections 2024:Trump and Haley in Greenville ahead of Republican primary Of Upstate residents who responded to The Citadel survey, 70% said they plan to vote for Trump, compared to only 25% who said they plan to vote for Haley. About 3% of Upstate residents who plan to vote in the primary said they have another candidate in mind, while 1% said they were unsure. National poll averages published by news and data site 538 show that nearly 78% of Americans planning to vote in the Republican primary intend to support Trump, compared to nearly 17% who said they plan to vote for Haley. Although Haley’s polling numbers are higher in her home state than they are across the country, 70% of those planning to vote in the South Carolina Republican primary said they expect Trump to win “by a large margin,” according to the Citadel’s poll. Haley on Tuesday said that despite Trump’s lead, she does not intend to drop out of the race. ""I have no fear of Trump’s retribution,"" Haley said during a Tuesday speech in Greenville. ""I’m not looking for anything from him."" Analysis:Fearing Biden, Trump rematch, SC Democrats weigh crossing party lines in upcoming primary South Carolina favored Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, where he received nearly about 55% of the state’s votes in each cycle. Ahead of the primary, Haley has made campaign stops throughout the state and frequently criticized the former president. The former governor recently made a joke about Trump’s legal fees as he undergoes investigations on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live two days ahead of an appearance in Spartanburg. Trump currently faces 91 felony charges in four states, including allegations that he attempted to reverse results after his loss during the 2020 election. According to a poll from Monmouth University and The Washington Post, 88% of South Carolinians planning to support Trump in the primary believe he should stay on the ticket even if he is convicted of a crime related to the 2020 election. Haley’s polling numbers may be trailing Trump’s, but her platform resonates with Upstate supporters according to the Suffolk University poll. In the Upstate, 42% of those who responded to the survey said immigration and border security were the most pressing concerns in the country. Throughout Haley’s various South Carolina appearances, including a rally in Greer on Monday night, she’s indicated she would crack down on border security. Haley frequently uses the line “Instead of a catch and release, we’ll do a catch and deport,” when speaking at her events. Trump has also been a vocal supporter of large-scale deportation and border arrest programs. Ahead of his presidency, he claimed he would build a wall around the U.S. southern border, which he did not complete. The Suffolk University poll also showed that despite Trump’s general lead, Haley was more popular among those planning to vote in the Republican primary who would lean more liberal or moderate. In both categories, 59% of those surveyed said they’d support Haley rather than Trump in the primary. More than 90% of those who responded to the Trafalgar Group survey were white, as were more than 84% of responders in the Suffolk University survey. In South Carolina, white residents make up nearly 69% of the state, while Black residents make up more than 26%. Asian residents account for 2% of the state’s population and Hispanic or Latino residents account for nearly 7%. As of Jan. 31, more than 3.24 million South Carolinians were registered to vote.Black voters accounted for 24.4% of registered voters in the state, Asian voters made up 1.3%, Hispanic residents made up slightly over 2% and Native American voters made up less than 1%. White voters accounted for 71% of registered voters in the state. 'I'm not going anywhere':Nikki Haley vows to keep fighting Donald Trump in 2024 GOP race Meanwhile, The Citadel poll showed a similar demographic divide in support for the former president. Among white responders, 63% had a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Trump, compared to only 14% of Black responders. A Trump victory Saturday could set up a likely rematch with incumbent President Joe Biden. Biden won the South Carolina Democratic primary at the beginning of February. The Associated Press called the race just over 20 minutes past the opening of the polls, with Biden sweeping about 96% of the vote.

,,"If Trump wins, more voters foresee better finances, staying out of war — CBS News poll","Watch CBS News November 5, 2023 / 9:30 AM EST / CBS News With views of things in America continuing to be bad and now hitting their most negative marks of the year, one might expect an incumbent president to trail in a pre-election poll — as Joe Biden does in this one. But that's only half the story. The other half is that Donald Trump holds distinct advantages in his own right when voters look forward: More voters think they'd be better off financially if Trump wins in 2024, and more voters think it's Trump who can keep the U.S. out of a war, if he wins. Mr. Biden's Democratic base looks a little more shaky than Trump's going into next year, too, which isn't helping him. On those financial measures, Mr. Biden hasn't fully made the case to his fellow Democrats that he'll help them financially, or address inequality — certainly not in the way Trump has convinced Republicans.  Looking overseas, Democrats aren't as sure about Mr. Biden avoiding an overseas war as Republicans are about Trump doing so. And then more directly, Democrats are just less apt to say they'll vote. Granted, it's far off, but it does speak to the challenges Mr. Biden has in front of him one year out from Election Day. Those partisans may be reading the polls, too: Mr. Biden's backers react to the idea of a rematch by mainly saying they're nervous and frustrated; Trump's say they're hopeful and motivated. Plus, as ever in American politics, views on race continue to play a role.  Let's unpack these more — first, the financial factor: Americans have long described financial setbacks because of inflation and interest rates. Those who feel they're worse off financially are backing Trump. And this isn't just punitive toward Mr. Biden — those voters overwhelmingly think they will be financially better off if Trump wins.  And voters continue to believe the wealthy are favored over the middle and working class in America today, and Mr. Biden has not persuaded them this would change during a second term, nor does he have any meaningful advantage over Trump in being seen as helping the middle and working class. The overseas factor:  As foreign policy dominates the news, it isn't the central vote driver here (it rarely is in presidential politics) but then again, it isn't helping Mr. Biden either: It's Trump more than Mr. Biden who is more widely viewed as decreasing the chance of the U.S. being in a war, and also more seen as able to increase peace and stability in the world. These are tough numbers for a president trying to inspire confidence in a time of international crisis. Mr. Biden gets less than the full backing from his own party: Democrats are less confident in Mr. Biden decreasing the chances of war in a second term than Republicans are in Trump.  Specifically, on Israel, each set of partisans think their candidate would back Israel the right amount. That's the majority sentiment within Mr. Biden's own party, but a third of Democrats think Biden would back Israel too much — which in turn undercuts Mr. Biden overall on this measure. Democrats are divided over whether the U.S. ought to give military aid to Israel.  Trump taps into the more isolationist tendencies that have long run through American politics, and which certainly seem to hold sway through much of the political right. He leads Mr. Biden with the majority of voters who want the U.S. to stay out of other countries' affairs. And Trump leads, even though more voters think  Trump would side with Russia over Ukraine or not take a side in that war.  Meanwhile, views of how things are going in America are worse now than at the start of 2023, and in fact have ticked to their harshest rating as we head into winter.  The race factor: Always a factor in American politics, race plays a part in the nascent 2024 campaign, too. Most White voters backing Trump believe that it's racial minorities who are favored over White people in America today — but they believe that if Trump wins, he would try to treat everyone the same.  These sentiments have echoes in those expressed by Trump voters as far back as Election Day 2016, when he first won the presidency. But Biden voters, and Democrats overall, see the impact of race in America quite differently: they believe White people are advantaged over racial minorities, and that Mr. Biden would try to treat them the same — views are shared by White voters backing Mr. Biden.  Those financial factors may be hurting Mr. Biden with Black and Hispanic voters, key parts of the Democratic coalition, who are not convinced they would be helped financially if he wins a second term.  Hispanic voters are much likelier to say their finances would improve under Trump than Mr. Biden. And most Black voters do not expect their finances to change if Mr. Biden wins again.  Partly as a result, he's down in support from 2020 with both those groups. His big majority of Black voters today isn't quite as big, and Hispanic voters are divided in their vote preference — similar to what we saw in September, but markedly down from the two-thirds who voted for him in 2020. The abortion factor: The abortion issue helped keep Democrats competitive in the 2022 midterms, and they are almost twice as likely as Republicans to say it makes them more likely to vote in 2024. It'll take the spotlight again this week in an Ohio referendum. Here, Mr. Biden does appear to have an opportunity, at least in terms of motivating his party. Most voters think his policies in a second term will try to protect abortion access (the public overall supports abortion being mostly legal). And Democrats are more confident in his affecting that than they are on some other issues.  All this helps put Trump in a better national position for this potential 2024 matchup, three points over Biden - a number that is slightly higher than September's and which would almost surely translate into a comfortable Electoral College win for Trump, were it to emerge in the national vote next year.  Finally, here are those differences in how each candidate's backers see the idea of a matchup. There's plenty of frustration and nervousness to go around, but it's more Trump voters who express being hopeful and motivated.  Kabir Khanna contributed to this report.

,,Nikki Haley Delivers State of the Race Speech,"Text NIKKI to 23456 “Not Going Anywhere” Nikki Haley Greenville, South Carolina Tuesday, February 20, 2024 Thank you all for being here. It’s another great day in South Carolina! And we’re hoping for an even better day on Saturday! Early voting is underway. I have a quick reminder to all South Carolinians. In a general election, you’re given a choice. In a primary, you make your choice. Make sure you make the right choice! Make sure your voices are heard, today, tomorrow, and on Saturday! Some of you—perhaps a few of you in the media—came here today to see if I’m dropping out of the race. Well, I’m not. Far from it. And I’m here to tell you why. I’m running for president because we have a country to save. Since the start of my campaign, I’ve been focused on the real issues our country faces. The ones that determine whether America will thrive… or spiral out. I’m talking about the millions of students who don’t know how to read or do basic math. The families who can’t afford groceries, much less a first home. The total lawlessness on our southern border. I’m talking about the murders in our cities, the fentanyl on our streets, the children who’ve been killed in their mom’s car by stray bullets. And I’m talking about the American weakness that led to wars in Europe and the Middle East—and the urgent need to restore our strength, before war spreads and draws America further in. These are the challenges I’m here to tackle. But instead of focusing on how to make America stronger tomorrow, some people want to know if I’m going to cave today. We’ve all heard the calls for me to drop out. We all know where they’re coming from. The political elite. The party bosses. Their cheerleaders in the commentator world. The argument is familiar. They say I haven’t won a state. That my path to victory is slim. They point to the primary polls and say I’m only delaying the inevitable. Why keep fighting when the battle was apparently over after Iowa? Look, I get it. In politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong. A lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it. The pressure on them was too much. They didn’t want to be left out of the club. Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party. They’re just too afraid to say it out loud. Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud. I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him. My own political future is of zero concern. So, I hear what the political class says. But I hear from the American people too. I’ve heard from a retired army medic who looked evil in the eye. When he says we’re heading toward disaster—that American lives are on the line—he knows what he’s talking about. He knows we can’t afford more of the same. That’s why he told me to “give ‘em hell.” I’ve heard from a mom who promised to email me every day and does. She just wants a “return to normalcy.” She wants me to keep running for the sake of her 4-year-old son. She hopes he’ll see the “America she grew up in”—an America that’s strong and proud and united in purpose. And I’ve heard from a high-school student, who just last week came to hear me speak. She asked me to sign a note to her teacher explaining her absence. After growing up amid the chaos and anger of the last few years, she finally has hope that America will make it… if we make the right choice. I’m constantly hearing from Americans like these—hundreds a day, thousands a week, and hundreds of thousands since I declared my candidacy. They see the same polls as me. But more importantly, they have the same belief as me. They believe in America. They believe America can do so much better—that we must do better. And they know when the country’s future is on the line, you don’t drop out. You keep fighting. In fact, you fight harder than ever. That’s why I refuse to quit. South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I’ll still be running for president. I’m not going anywhere. I’m campaigning every day, until the last person votes, because I believe in a better America and a brighter future for our kids. Nothing good in life comes easy. I’m willing to take the cuts, the bruises, and the name calling. Because the only way you get to the blessing is by going through the pain. Dropping out would be the easy route. I’ve never taken the easy route. I’ve been the underdog in every race I’ve ever run. I’ve always been David taking on Goliath. And like David, I’m not just fighting someone bigger than me. I’m fighting for something bigger than myself. I’m used to people questioning my intentions, so I’ll make a few things clear. Some people used to say I was running because I really wanted to be Vice President. I think I’ve pretty well settled that question. Other people say I’m trying to set up a future presidential run. How does that even work? If I was running for a bogus reason, I would have dropped out a long time ago. The rest of the fellas already did that. They have their own plans. I don’t judge them. But I’m still here. I’m fighting for what I know is right. And I don’t care what the party leaders and political elites want. I’ll keep fighting until the American people close the door. That day is not today. And it won’t be Saturday. Not by a long shot. The presidential primaries have barely begun. Just three states have voted. Three. That’s it. After this weekend, we’ll be at four. That’s not a lot. In the 10 days after South Carolina, another 21 states and territories will vote. People have a right to have their voices heard. And they deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don’t rig elections! Americans of every belief and background are tired of our national mess. They don’t want more chaos and craziness. They worry about a national collapse. If I weren’t in the race, we’d be reading the exact same story every day until November 5. There would be widespread reports of Americans suffering from a bad case of “Biden-Trump fatigue.” And it would be true. A stunning 70% of the country doesn’t want a Biden-Trump rematch. The majority of Americans don’t just dislike one candidate. They dislike both. As a country, we’ve never seen such dissatisfaction with the leading candidates. We’ve never had so many Americans mired in pessimism and division. We still have a chance to restore their faith. I will fight as long as that chance exists. Now, I know what Donald Trump is saying. He wants an election with no opponent. But that’s not what voters are saying. Despite being a de facto incumbent, Donald Trump lost 49% of the vote in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Trump lost 46% of the vote. That’s not good. We’re talking about almost half our voters. What does it say about an incumbent who is losing nearly half his party? It spells disaster in November. We shouldn’t silence these voters, like Trump wants. They have the right to keep speaking out. Trump sees this. That’s why he and his allies are now trying a different tack. They’re saying I’m helping Joe Biden by staying in. Let’s unpack that for a second. First thing’s first: Joe Biden is doing more damage to himself than any Republican could ever do. Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds like his mind is closing up shop. The Democrats are getting weaker by holding a coronation for Biden. Republicans will get stronger through a vigorous competition. We have plenty of time to hash this out. If the race ended today, we’d have the longest general election in history. There are still eight and a half months before Election Day. Do we really want to spend every day from now until November watching America’s two most disliked politicians duke it out? No sane person wants that. But there’s another reason Trump is wrong. At the end of the day, the only candidate who’s helping Joe Biden is Donald Trump, because Trump is the only Republican Biden can beat. The Democrats know it. They don’t even try to conceal their glee at the prospect of running against Trump. They want to win—so they want the guy they’ve already beaten time and again. Trump knows it too, but he won’t admit it. True to form, he’s taking out his anger on others. He’s getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He’s trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they’ll be barred from MAGA—permanently. That’s not the way you win elections. Well, I’ve dealt with bullies my entire life. They don’t intimidate me. They only motivate me further. And I’ve never met a bully I couldn’t take on. There are also those who try to paint me as, quote, “Never Trump.” That’s not who I am. Never have been. I supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. I was proud to serve America in his Cabinet. My purpose has never been to stop Trump at all costs. Like most Americans, I have a handful of serious concerns about the former President. But I have countless serious concerns about the current president. Joe Biden has turned our country upside down. It’s not normal for millions of migrants to illegally cross our border without being stopped. It’s not normal for our schools to be more focused on gender pronouns than reading and math. It’s not normal to have skyrocketing prices and soaring crime. And it’s not normal to have wars raging in Europe and the Middle East. All of that is on Joe Biden. But he’s not the only one who’s replaced normalcy with chaos. Donald Trump has done that, too. It’s not normal to insult our military heroes and veterans. It’s not normal to spend fifty million dollars in campaign donations on personal court cases. It’s not normal to threaten the people who back your opponent. And it’s not normal to call on Russia to invade NATO countries. Donald Trump has done all that and more in just the last month. Look, I’ve said it many times — I think Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. But times change—and so has Trump. He’s gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He’s completely distracted. And everything is about him. He’s so obsessed with his own demons from the past, he can’t focus on delivering the future Americans deserve. We have two hugely flawed candidates in Biden and Trump. Americans know it. They’ve been saying it for years. And we all know why. Trump and Biden are two old men who are only getting older. Nearly 60% of Americans say Trump and Biden are both too old to be president—because they are. We’ve all seen them fumble their words and get confused about world leaders. That’s not who you want in the Oval Office when Russia launches a nuclear weapon at our satellites or China shuts down our electricity grid. We’re talking about the most demanding job in human history. You don’t give it to someone who’s at risk of dementia. You give it to someone who is disciplined—someone who can work day and night for eight years straight. No vendettas. No drama. Just results. Even if Trump and Biden weren’t too old—and again, they are—Americans still oppose them because we know what they’ll do. They’ve already done tremendous damage—and they’re just getting started. Biden has crippled families with years of inflation. He’s put welfare over work and doled out more corporate welfare than any president, ever. Meanwhile, Trump added more to the national debt than any president in history. And it wasn’t because of COVID, no matter how many times he tries that excuse. Now he wants a 10% tax hike on every American. Just like Biden, Trump will devastate families and destroy good-paying jobs. We need to shift our economy into overdrive—not reverse. Most importantly, we need a President who protects America. Biden has failed this basic duty. As Commander-in-Chief, he tried to cut the military. He’s made us weaker while our enemies get stronger. He withdrew from Afghanistan in a way that encouraged our enemies to do whatever they want. Three years later, Russia has invaded Ukraine. Hamas has murdered Israeli women and children in their beds. China is launching unprecedented cyberattacks on American infrastructure. Iran is killing American soldiers. At the same time, Donald Trump has plenty of his own problems on national security. He’s all but said he’ll abandon Ukraine. That’s a massive gift to Vladimir Putin. Now Trump is inviting Putin to invade NATO countries. Those are the same countries that stood with us after September 11th. Of course we should demand they pay more. But abandoning them will only bring more war. Putin is already planning his next move. He’s eyeing our allies in the Baltics. A Russian attack would put America at war. Russia isn’t the only country that smells blood in the water. When the dictators in Iran, North Korea, and Communist China see America step back, they rush into the breach. They think America’s time has passed—and their time has come. The truth is, Americans already know what Joe Biden and Donald Trump will do. But we’re just as concerned with who they are. They’re dividers at a time when America desperately, urgently, needs a uniter. All they do is turn us against each other. Trump calls his fellow Americans vermin. Biden calls his fellow Americans fascists. Trump and Biden don’t just demand that people pick sides. They demand that their followers hate the other side. Look where that’s gotten us. Congress is too divided and broken to do its job. Families won’t even talk to each other at the dinner table. We’re separating into opposing camps that view each other as un- American, if not downright evil. These are dangerous times. The most important thing we must do is regain our focus and shared sense of purpose. The worst thing we can do is become even more distracted and divided. The reason I’m running—the reason I continue to run—is to remind everyone what it means to be American. I’m the proud daughter of legal immigrants. I grew up as a brown girl in a black-and-white world. I saw our state move beyond hatred and elect the first female minority governor in American history—as a conservative Republican. And in just a few days, my parents are going to cast their vote for their daughter for President of the United States. I’ve thought this week about what that means to them. But I know what it says about our country. In the America I know and love, we disagree strongly, but we do it without hating each other, and we still have a shared national purpose. In the America I know and love, we respect freedom and the rule of law, we refuse to use the awesome power of big government to punish those we dislike, and we recognize that America has done more good for more people than any country in the world. It’s not America First to withdraw from the world. It’s not America First to praise dictators who want to kill Americans. It’s not America First to bankrupt Social Security by doing nothing to fix it. And in fact, it’s America Last to keep losing one election after another to the Socialist Left. That’s what we get with Donald Trump. I’m running for president to restore a country that’s strong and proud. That is why I will stay in the race after South Carolina votes. And to my beloved fellow South Carolinians, I ask that you stand with me. Stand with your family, friends, and neighbors. See the America I see. And remember that we can still unite and move forward together—not with anger and fear, but with faith and hope, like we’ve done before. Let’s finally leave the past behind—and let’s forge a new American future. This vision has guided every generation. It summoned me to serve as governor of this great state, and as ambassador for the greatest country in the world. And that same vision called my husband to serve in the uniform of the United States. He’s a major in the South Carolina Army National Guard. As I prepare for what lies ahead, Michael is at the front of my mind. I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight. But we can’t. He’s serving on the other side of the world, where conflict is the norm. Where terrorists hide among the innocent. Where Iran’s terrorist proxies are now attacking American troops. This is Michael’s second deployment. It was hard for us to say goodbye the first time, when he deployed to Afghanistan. It was even harder last summer when he deployed to Africa. As every military family knows, when a loved one deploys, it’s a year-long prayer. It’s a prayer for their safety, more than anything else. But it’s also a prayer of gratitude. The kids and I know why Michael went. He stepped up to keep us safe—and not just us. He stepped up to defend our nation’s freedom and our way of life. Michael is fighting for the country he loves. So are all his brothers-and-sisters-in-arms, wherever they’re stationed in our dangerous world. They have made their stand because America is worth fighting and even dying for. Now I will continue to make my stand because America is worth living for. Thank you. God bless you, God bless South Carolina, and God bless America.

,,Some Michigan Jews Aim to Pressure Biden on Israel by Voting ‘Uncommitted’ in the Primary,"  (JTA) – About two dozen progressive Jewish activists tuned into the “MI Jews Uncommitted Phone Bank” this week, ready to ask their networks not to vote for President Joe Biden. Their virtual phone bank, held ahead of Michigan’s Feb. 27 primary, was unlike any other. Instead of a get-out-the-vote campaign, this crew would be better described as don’t-get-out-the-vote.  Upset with Biden’s stalwart support for Israel in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and with the tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties, most of them civilians, these Jews want to use their moment at the ballot box to force the president to change course.  The campaign subscribes to the view that Israel’s actions constitute genocide, a charge common among pro-Palestinian activists that Israel and the United States strenuously deny. Israel says it is not intentionally targeting civilians and blames Hamas for embedding among and beneath them. “As Michigan Jews, we are important messengers in a multiracial and multi-faith, anti-war coalition telling President Biden that we are uncommitted to his administration’s funding of genocidal war in Gaza,” a mission statement reads. The Jews backing the Uncommitted campaign — which is also called Listen to Michigan — are part of a fast-growing movement, initiated by local Arab American activists, that hopes to send a message to the White House about its Israel policy. And they think the swing state’s new early primary slot gives them a perfect chance to do so. “I think that there is an assumption from the Biden administration, as well as many others in power, that they can count on Jewish support and the Jewish vote as things carry on in this way in Gaza,” Eleanor Gamalski, a local Jewish organizer who headed up the phone bank, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “Many Jews that I know would object to that.” Gamalski is the deputy director of Detroit Jews for Justice, a social justice nonprofit, and a onetime staffer for Andy Levin, the Jewish former Democratic congressman and member of a Michigan political dynasty. But her participation in the Uncommitted campaign is on her own behalf. She’s a longtime friend of Abbas Alawieh, a Lebanese American Democratic strategist who helped launch the campaign alongside Layla Elabed, sister of Detroit Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American and the House’s most vocal Israel critic.  To Gamalski, the movement seemed like a perfect opportunity to push for policies her progressive Jewish network wants: namely, a ceasefire in Gaza, an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian security prisoners, and a commitment “to stop sending U.S. weapons and dollars to fund this genocide.” Michigan is one of a handful of key swing states that helped determine the last two presidential elections, in one case by a razor-thin margin: Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by only about 10,000 votes. The Uncommitted campaign hopes to demonstrate it has at least that number of supporters, a large enough bloc to potentially swing the state and force Biden’s attention.  Campaign organizers declined to tell JTA how many people had signed its pledge. But Arab and Muslim Americans have been warning for months that their communities could withhold their votes from Biden over Gaza. With an estimated more than 300,000 Arab Americans in the state along with assorted allies, the 10,000 mark seems plausible to reach. (Getting to Biden’s margin of victory in 2020, more than 150,000, would be more difficult.) At least some Jewish voters will be part of the count — including, possibly, Levin himself. He told JTA he’s backing the Uncommitted campaign precisely because he wants to ensure Biden takes Michigan in November. He doesn’t think the president’s current course on Israel will cut it: not just for Arab and Muslim Americans, but also for other constituencies like Black churches, which have become increasingly vocal in their calls for a ceasefire. “I’m betting on Joe Biden to find a way to become a peacemaker in Israel and Palestine, so that people can vote for him later,” Levin said. “I feel like this is existential for Joe Biden’s political survival. I don’t see how he wins reelection without winning Michigan, and I don’t see how he wins Michigan without changing course.” Levin isn’t the only big progressive voice supporting the campaign. Our Revolution, an activist group founded by progressive Jewish Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 and currently chaired by Jewish labor activist Larry Cohen, also announced this week that it would encourage its 87,000 Michigan followers to vote Uncommitted to “push Biden to change course on Gaza now.”  Michigan is also home to a Jewish community of around 100,000, and its big Jewish institutions and personalities — including Temple Israel, the nation’s largest Reform congregation, as well as a politically connected yeshiva and a former president of AIPAC — remain staunchly pro-Israel. A poll from November showed that most American Jews back Biden’s approach to the conflict, and previous polls have shown that most U.S. Jews have an affinity for Israel. The Detroit JCRC/AJC, the local federation’s community relations arm, told JTA it would not be issuing any public comment on the Uncommitted campaign. And the campaign is new enough that some major figures in the state’s Jewish community told JTA they had not heard a lot about it — though they were not happy about what they learned. “Any effort that takes votes away from Joe Biden will only benefit Donald Trump, and job one is to make sure he doesn’t become president,” Mark Jacobs, a local liberal AIPAC supporter who also co-founded the Detroit Coalition for Black and Jewish Unity, told JTA. Jacobs — who has done significant outreach to Detroit-area Black churches since the outbreak of war on Oct. 7 and is preparing to launch a leadership academy this month for Black and Jewish teenagers — didn’t know about the Uncommitted campaign; he said he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the coalition or AIPAC. When he found out about the campaign, Jacobs said he didn’t think a successful Uncommitted initiative would change many Jewish votes in Michigan, even if Biden took a more aggressive posture toward Israel as a result of the pressure. “Arguably, there may be a sliver of Jewish voters who are a bit on the fence about Biden and maybe if he becomes more vocal during the political season, saying things that are not embraced by many members of the Jewish community, then that could have an impact to some extent,” he said. “But I’m just so fixated on the god-awful harm that would be caused by a Trump presidency.”  Few are as familiar with navigating intra-Jewish politics in the state as Levin himself, who lost a primary race for his redrawn House seat in 2022 after pro-Israel groups unhappy with his policies spent more than $4 million to back his non-Jewish opponent over him. Still, Levin insisted, Biden “doesn’t have to worry about the Jewish vote, I don’t think.” In an acknowledgement of the growing pressure on him regarding Israel, Biden’s team met recently with Arab leaders in the state to apologize for “missteps” in his handling of the war, including not more forcefully advocating for Palestinian lives. Alawieh said he interpreted this as referring to the president’s public statements, not his actual Israel policies.  “Senior Biden officials were talking about the mistakes as more of a messaging problem,” Alawieh told reporters during a Listen to Michigan press briefing last week. “But what was absent from what they were saying was any commitment to push even privately for a ceasefire that saves lives.” Asked by JTA what it would take for him to come back around on Biden before November, Alawieh said he wanted to see the president “apply the most basic levels of accountability to condition military funding” to Israel. Elabed said she would need to see “a permanent ceasefire” before she would even consider voting for Biden. Many in Michigan and beyond aren’t thrilled with the campaign’s goals. “This is how Trump becomes president again,” reads a typical comment on the Listen to Michigan Instagram, a concern also echoed by Michigan’s popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.  “A potential second term for the former president would be very hard on all the communities that are still being impacted by what’s happening overseas as well, and that’s something that shouldn’t be lost on people’s calculation, too,” Whitmer told reporters Thursday. Gamalski rejects that argument. “I think the Biden administration, if they are to lose to Trump in November, it’s because of the choices that they have made and the courage they failed to exhibit in standing up to the weapons industry and in calling for a stop to this war,” she said.  Organizers insist the campaign only applies to the primary (in contrast to another local campaign, Abandon Biden, encouraging Michigan voters to stay home altogether in November). Yet many members are noncommittal about how they’ll vote in the general. One of Listen to Michigan’s Instagram posts suggests the campaign could hurt Biden more than just symbolically.  “Uncommitted is the best strategy because it not only takes votes away from Biden but removes delegates from him if we can get to a 15% threshold,” the post reads. “If Biden doesn’t get enough delegates nationally he doesn’t get the nomination.” And then there’s the fact that some of the loudest voices pushing for an Uncommitted vote have also praised Hamas or downplayed the extent of the atrocities it committed on Oct. 7. Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, headquartered in Dearborn, said at an October rally, “We are not going to be intimidated by staying silent when they say Hamas is a terrorist organization.” He was in the meeting with Biden officials and has endorsed the Uncommitted campaign, saying, “Vote for anyone you want to vote for, but don’t vote for Biden because he is complacent in the crime against Palestinians.” The Jews backing the campaign acknowledge the presence of views like Silbani’s but say it doesn’t change their support. Levin said it’s “all the more reason to get in there and hold up a banner of integrity and of sanity,” to prove that not everyone backing a ceasefire is a Hamas supporter. Gamalski chooses to focus on the ways in which she does feel kinship with the campaign’s organizers.  “It’s really evident to me that the folks organizing this are concerned about bringing about a better future for everyone, including Jews,” she said. “I know that folks in this coalition have shown up for me and spoken out against antisemitism, and they don’t compartmentalize their work on any one oppression. And so I knew right away that I was in good company.” Log In   ",www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html,
,,Nikki Haley hasn’t yet won a GOP contest. But she’s vowing to keep fighting Donald Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — There are no wins on the horizon for Nikki Haley. Those close to the former United Nations ambassador, the last major Republican candidate standing in Donald Trump’s path to the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, are privately bracing for a blowout loss in her home state’s primary election in South Carolina on Saturday. And they cannot name a state where she is likely to beat Trump in the coming weeks. But ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of Saturday’s result. And backed by the strongest fundraising numbers of her political career, she vowed to stay in the fight against Trump at least until after Super Tuesday’s slate of more than a dozen contests on March 5. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In fact, some Republicans are encouraging Haley to stay in the campaign even if she continues to lose — potentially all the way to the Republican National Convention in July. Her continued presence could come in handy in the event that the 77-year-old former president, perhaps the most volatile major party front-runner in U.S. history, becomes a convicted felon or stumbles into another major scandal. As Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement presses for her exit, a defiant Haley will outline her rationale for sticking in the race for the foreseeable future Tuesday afternoon in South Carolina. In an interview ahead of the speech, she highlighted Trump’s legal exposure and criticized MAGA activists who say she’s hurting Trump’s chances against President Joe Biden in the general election by refusing to drop out. “That’s about the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. If I get out of the race today, it will be the longest general election in history,” Haley said. She also pushed back when asked if there is any primary state where she can defeat Trump. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” Haley’s hurdles History would suggest Haley has no chance of stopping Trump. Never before has a Republican lost even the first two primary contests, as Haley has by an average of 21 points, and gone on the win the party’s presidential nomination. Polls suggest she is a major underdog in her home state on Saturday and in the 16 Super Tuesday contests to follow. And since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015, every effort by a Republican to blunt Trump’s rise has failed. Yet she is leaning into the fight. Lest anyone question her commitment, Haley’s campaign is spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan ahead of the state’s Feb. 27 primary, according to spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. At the same time, the AP has obtained Haley’s post-South Carolina travel schedule that features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Indeed, Haley’s expansive base of big- and small-dollar donors is donating at an extraordinary pace despite her underwhelming performance at the polls. That’s a reflection of persistent Republican fears about Trump’s ability to win over independents and moderate voters in the general election and serious concerns about his turbulent leadership should he return to the White House. “I’m going to support her up to the convention,” said Republican donor Eric Levine, who co-hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month. “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” “There’s value in her sticking in and gathering delegates, because if and when he stumbles,” Levine continued, “who knows what happens.” Levine is far from alone. Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, Perez-Cubas said. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever — which includes $2 million in small-dollar donations online in the 48 hours after Trump threatened to “permanently bar” Haley supporters from his MAGA movement. Haley raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. The lone member of Congress who has endorsed Haley, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., insisted that she would stay in the race even if she is blown out in South Carolina, a state where she lives and served two terms as governor. “Obviously, you want to win them all, but for those who say it’s going to embarrass her, or end her political career, I disagree. She’s willing to take that risk,” Norman said in an interview. “I think it’s a courageous thing she’s doing.” Moving forward, Haley’s team is especially focused on several Super Tuesday states with open or semi-open Republican primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate — especially independents and moderates — instead of just hardcore conservatives. Trump not happy Trump, in recent days, has shown flashes of fury in response to Haley’s refusal to cede the nomination. He called her “stupid” and “birdbrain” in a social media post over the weekend and his campaign released a memo ahead of her speech on Tuesday predicting that she would be forced out of the race after losing her home state on Saturday. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” Trump’s campaign chiefs wrote. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Eager to pivot toward a general election matchup against Biden, the Republican former president is taking aggressive steps to assume control of the Republican National Committee, the GOP’s nationwide political machine, which is supposed to stay neutral in presidential primary elections. Last week, Trump announced plans to install his campaign’s senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as RNC’s chief operating officer and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the committee’s co-chair. And there is every expectation that current Chair Ronna McDaniel will step down after Trump wins South Carolina’s primary and party officials will ultimately acquiesce to Trump’s wishes. Privately, Haley’s team concedes there is nothing it can do to stop the Trump takeover. In the interview, Haley warned her party against letting Trump raid the RNC’s coffers to pay for his legal fees while taking a short-term view of Trump’s political prospects. Trump’s standing will fundamentally change if he is a convicted felon before Election Day, Haley said, acknowledging that such an outcome is a very real possibility as Trump navigates 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” As for her path forward, Haley said she’s focused only on her plans through Super Tuesday. As for staying in the race through the July convention, she said she hasn’t thought that far ahead. Some voters wish she would. Gil White, a 75-year-old Republican veteran from James Island, South Carolina, said he was a Trump loyalist until the former president criticized Haley’s husband, a military serviceman, last week. “For him to disparage a military man in deployment is just too much,” White said while attending a Haley rally in Kiawah Island over the weekend. He acknowledged concerns about Haley’s chances against Trump, but said he wants her to stay in the race even if she continues to lose. “I want the choice,” he said. ___ AP writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.

,,Poll: Most Americans don't want Biden or Trump to run,"President Biden and former President Trump speak during a presidential debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, on Oct. 22, 2020. Photo: Kevin Dietsch/UPI/Bloomberg via Getty Images Most Americans say they don't want former President Trump or President Biden to run for president in 2024, new polling shows. The big picture: Biden formally announced Tuesday that he is seeking re-election and Trump, the current frontrunner in the Republican race, announced his bid in November, setting up a rematch that most voters are unenthused about. Driving the news: According to a new NBCNews poll, 70% of Americans believe Biden should not run for re-election, with 51% of Democrats saying that. (The poll was taken before Biden officially announced his re-election bid). Still, Democratic and Republican voters still say they will vote for the former and current president in the general election. The big picture: Biden sees Trump as a threat to America and as the primary reason to run for president and build his campaign around, Axios' Hans Nichols reports. Methodology: The NBC News poll was conducted April 14-18 of 1,000 adults — including 861 reached by cell phone — and it has an overall margin of error of ±3.1 percentage points. Go deeper...

Why it matters: Biden administration officials say they want to try and get a deal before the start of Ramadan in less than three weeks in order to ensure there is a temporary ceasefire in place during the Muslim holy month. But major gaps between Israel and Hamas remain.

,,Voters Say Those on the Other Side ‘Don’t Get’ Them. Here’s What They Want Them to Know.,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  In the wake of a bitterly contested presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants to work to narrow the nation’s deep partisan divisions. It is likely to be a formidable task. Voters who supported Biden and Donald Trump say they not only differ over policies, but also have fundamental disagreements over core American values. Yet there is a sentiment with which large shares of both Biden and Trump voters agree: a feeling that those who supported the other candidate have little or no understanding of people like them. Just 2% of Biden voters – and an equally small share of Trump voters – say those who voted for the opposing candidate understand them “very well,” according to Pew Research Center’s November post-election survey. If they had the chance, what would Biden and Trump voters want those on the opposing side to know about them to understand them better? Pew Research Center asked them – and they had a lot to say. Explore a sampling of voters’ word-for-word answers, and see how some common themes emerge. Many voters responded by asserting their own political values: About a quarter of Biden voters (26%) and 32% of Trump voters wanted their counterparts to know some of the key values that are important to them. About one-in-ten Biden (12%) and Trump voters (11%) used the opportunity to tell those in the other camp not to ascribe negative stereotypes to them. These voters described in some detail how they feel mischaracterized and how the other side’s criticisms of them are flawed or inaccurate. Some voters struck themes of unity and common ground, including 13% of Biden voters and 5% of Trump supporters. They offered a perspective that Biden and Trump supporters are more alike than they are different or expressed a need for both groups to recognize each other as Americans. While some voters called for unity, larger shares (21% of Biden voters and 23% of Trump voters) criticized the opposing candidate or his supporters, often in harsh terms. This included explanations of why they are personally against Trump, Biden, or their opposing party’s behavior and policies. Two other themes worth noting were expressed by small shares of both Trump and Biden voters: 7% of Trump voters and 6% of Biden voters wrote about how they believe the other side is being misinformed. And about 3% of Biden and Trump voters took this opportunity to share personal, humanizing details about themselves. Explore more of what Biden and Trump voters want the other to know about them below.         Notes: Based on voters. Open-ended question. Open-end responses coded for multiple responses.

,,," Part of the McClatchy Media Network Wednesday, February 21, 2024 Today's eEdition Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off Saturday in South Carolina’s first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary, the first head-to-head matchup for the last two remaining major candidates since the New Hampshire primary a month ago. The contest takes place on Haley’s home turf. She was South Carolina's governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base. Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet. Haley has increasingly questioned Trump’s fitness for office, most recently criticizing his comments on Russia and NATO. It is a marked contrast from earlier in the campaign when she and other GOP hopefuls avoided criticizing Trump directly. The South Carolina primary is usually an indicator of which candidate will win the Republican presidential nomination. Since the modern version of the state’s primary began in 1980, all but one GOP primary winner has gone on to win the party’s nomination. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012. A look at what to expect on election night: The primary will be held Saturday and polls will close statewide at 7 p.m. EST. The ballot will list Ryan Binkley, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, David Stuckenberg, and Trump. South Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party’s primary. But voters may only participate in one party’s presidential primary, so people who voted in the Democratic primary on Feb. 3 may not vote in the Republican contest. Only about 4% of registered voters cast ballots in the Democratic contest, leaving the bulk of the electorate, including any Democrats and independents who favor Haley over Trump and didn’t vote in the earlier contest, eligible to weigh in on the Republican race. There are 50 delegates at stake and 29 will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Twenty-one delegates will be allocated according to the vote in each of the state’s seven congressional districts. The top vote-getter in each district will get three delegates from that district. The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state’s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics. Republican electoral politics have changed dramatically since the last time Haley and Trump each faced other Republican candidates in the Palmetto State. Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday’s primary. In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley’s strongest showings and some of Trump’s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections. Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Haley’s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump. The results are broadly consistent with Haley’s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas. These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties. The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. There are about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. Voters do not register by party. Turnout in the 2016 Republican primary was about 25% of registered voters. It was about 22% in the 2012 primary. Saturday’s contest will be the first Republican presidential primary held in the state since a new early voting law was enacted in May 2022. The law allows voters to cast ballots in-person before Election Day without an excuse. The early voting period for the GOP primary is Feb. 12-22, excluding Feb. 18-19. In the 2016 Republican primary, when voters had to provide an excuse to cast an absentee ballot, about 8% of votes were cast before Election Day. In the 2022 midterm primaries, after the new law went into effect, pre-Election Day voting was at about 21%. About 36% of votes cast in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary were before Election Day. As of Tuesday night, more than 139,000 voters had cast their ballots. In the 2024 South Carolina Democratic primary, the AP first reported results at 7:08 p.m. EST. Primary night tabulation ended at 10:47 p.m. EST with nearly 100% of votes counted. As of Saturday, there will be 142 days until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and 255 until the November general election.

,,Will Biden campaign focus on saving democracy resonate in swing states? Here’s what Lehigh Valley voters say,"         Daily e-Edition Evening e-Edition TRENDING:                                           Raymond Santiago, executive director of Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, sees the recent 38% rise in use of the organization's food pantry as a stark sign: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. (Chris Szagola/AP) BETHLEHEM — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling during lunch recently. Out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the last seven months, the number of visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign that many in the area’s Latino community are struggling. Northampton County, which includes most of Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the campaign coalition President Joe Biden is trying to rebuild. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination in 2024, is a danger to American democracy. Biden hopes the message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped his way after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. The threat messaging “won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge in Montgomery County, a place with deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, as the site of his initial campaign event for 2024, describing the upcoming race as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave in Philadelphia before the 2022 midterm elections. Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season this year. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging was resonating. They represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: Biden’s warning that a second Trump presidency will undermine democratic institutions is, by itself, not enough to motivate voters. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, said her opinion of Trump was already set before Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to halt certification of Biden’s victory. But she doesn’t feel that reminders of that day will be sufficient to engage voters in November. Her own priorities are immigration and federal spending abroad. Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad living in a more rural area of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He believes the warnings are overblown and notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’ ” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock. The bank executive from Nazareth said he also believes the threat concerns are overstated. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges,” he said. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages also will be essential elements of the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry nearly 30 years ago and is now enjoying a revival as a technology and health care hub. The county has long been a political bellwether. The last time its vote differed from the state’s in a presidential election was 1948, said Chris Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. Since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977, she has crossed party lines frequently — until 2016 when she voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time. The people Kodama encounters are more likely to respond to a positive messages. She would like Biden to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit this year to  Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. That strategy “resonates with me and with people I know,” said the artist and former teacher. For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message about Trump is not generating new concerns: “We already know who he is,” she said. Lee said in her circle the No. 1 issue is homelessness and its companion, affordable housing. At the Lehigh Hispanic center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the 27 years he worked at Bethlehem Steel. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric has made targets of Latinos and other minorities. But Lopez thinks messaging about Trump imperiling democracy actually “harms the vote.” The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,‘I Refuse To Quit’: Nikki Haley Vows To Stay In GOP Race Against Donald Trump,"  Nikki Haley, the last candidate standing between Donald Trump and the GOP nomination, doubled down on her commitment to stay in the presidential race beyond the primary in her home state this weekend, amid the latest round of negative polling for her campaign and a scathing new memo from Trump’s advisers. “Some of you, perhaps a few of you in the media, came here today to see if I’m dropping out of the race. Well, I’m not... I refuse to quit,” Haley said in Greensboro, South Carolina, squashing speculation that she called a last-minute press conference to announce the end of her campaign. Instead, Haley laced Trump and the politicians who support Trump in public but secretly oppose him behind the scenes. “Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump, privately dread him,” she said. “They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party. They’re just too afraid to say it out loud. Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truth out loud. I feel no need to kiss the ring. I have no fear of Trump’s retribution.” The former South Carolina governor — Trump’s first nominee for the role of ambassador to the United Nations — has gone all out in her criticism of the former president since the race turned into a two-person matchup in New Hampshire. “True to form, he’s taking out his anger on others,” Haley said. “He’s getting meaner and more offensive by the day. He’s trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. He says they’ll be barred from MAGA permanently. That’s not the way you win elections.” Haley in recent days has attacked Trump for staying silent on the murder of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and for his endorsement of MAGA loyalists to lead the Republican National Committee before he’s even secured the GOP nomination, arguing that she doesn’t want the RNC to become “Trump’s legal defense fund.” Trump is on the hook for nearly half a billion dollars in civil judgments, and has previously tapped his campaign to pay some of his legal fees. But Trump’s campaign predicted Haley’s demise in a new memo on Tuesday, projecting that Trump would clear the delegate threshold required to become the GOP presidential nominee as early as Mach 12, after voters in 21 states head to the polls. “We won’t bore you with the reams of data that show an ass-kicking in the making in South Carolina, but we will show you the very serious math problem Nikki Haley has. This is the diagnosis she refuses to accept: The end is near,” Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in the memo, which was shared with the media. Even if their math is off and Haley manages to overperform in upcoming primaries in states like California and Michigan on Super Tuesday, March 5, the odds are stacked heavily against her. Trump continues to dominate in polls of the race and each contest will only add to his delegate haul, adding to the sense of inevitability around his campaign. A Suffolk University/USA Today survey of likely voters released Tuesday found Trump leading Haley 2-1 — 63% to 35% — in the state where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. (Haley stepped down from that office before the end of her final term to become Trump’s U.N. ambassador.) Haley’s only hope of shaking up the race at this point may be external to the GOP — Trump faces 91 criminal charges, including ones stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which he lost. But even the possibility of jail time hasn’t shaken his hold on GOP voters and elected officials. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” LaCivita and Wiles added in the memo. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Haley’s campaign is anything but out of gas, however. She raised $17 million last quarter, just $2 million shy of Trump’s $19 million haul in the same time period. She has a solid $14 million cash on hand and a big fundraising swing planned in Super Tuesday primary states in the coming weeks. And all of Haley’s cash will allow her to continue a campaign denying Trump access to the big checks available to his likely Democratic opponent. President Joe Biden, who has formed joint fundraising committees with the DNC and state Democratic parties to collect up to $929,600 from a single donor. Until he clinches the nomination, Trump is limited to the normal federal limit of $3,300. Biden announced Tuesday he raised $42 million in January and has $130 million on hand. Trump and Haley have yet to announce their January fundraising. “People have a right to have their voices heard, and they deserve a real choice,” Haley said on Tuesday. “Not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and gets 99% of the vote. “We don’t anoint kings in this country,” she continued. “We have elections and Donald Trump of all people should know we don’t rig elections.” At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

,,," That’s a mischaracterization. Basically he cracked a joke that it was absurd that a black person would struggle with choosing between him and the guy endorsed by the KKK. And when you think about it, it is remarkably absurd that anyone of color would vote for someone who used as much racist rhetoric as IQ 45. He said it on The Morning Show, to a black host who was pushing his buttons to be sure. Biden’s point—stated as badly as he could possibly state it—was that any black person who votes for a party whose elected officials are 97% white men should be questioning his life choices. Trump is the most blatantly racist President since Woodrow Wilson. Back in the 1970s Trump was convicted of refusing to rent apartments to blacks—systematically. He called for the execution of the Central Park Five who later were exonerated, and he still wouldn’t retract what he’d said. Republicans love to pounce on this                  No, that’s completely false The precise quote is, and you can find the actual interview on YouTube (like I did, so I’m not going to help your lazy ass) is: ““Well, I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black,” And when he says “you” he was using the singular form and referring to the interviewer, who was saying that he wasn’t sure if Biden or Trump was the better choice for black people Yes.

,,The 2020 election shows Gen Z's voting power for years to come," RELATED STORIES A record-breaking 159.8 million Americans voted in the 2020 election. And a record-breaking number of those votes went to President-elect Joe Biden, who received over 78 million votes — roughly 5.5 million more than Donald Trump. Generation Z, who are currently between the ages of 8 and 23, played a significant role in both of these records. NBC exit polls suggest that 65% of those between the ages of 18 and 24 voted for Biden — 11% more than any other age group.  And in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, young voters proved to be key to Biden's success.  ""I've been doing demographic analysis about the changing American electorate for two decades,"" says Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN (previously known as the New Democrat Network) and the New Policy Institute. ""53% to 55% of registered 18 to 29-year-olds appear to have voted. That may be the highest ever recorded in the modern era of politics."" ""Both Generation Z and millennials are voting generations,"" says Brent Cohen, executive director of Generation Progress. ""The preliminary data says, in fact, this was the election with the highest turnout rate of young people that we've ever seen."" ""Gen Z voters were very enthusiastic about this election,"" says Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ""A number of things appeared to be driving young people's level of participation and level of excitement about the campaign and it wasn't Joe Biden, though they certainly like Joe Biden overall. They were voting more against Donald Trump than they were for Joe Biden."" ""I think that this election was a referendum on the last four years,"" says Nickoli Benkert, a 19-year-old sophomore studying political communications at the University of Texas at Austin. Benkert is also a first-time voter and like the majority of his cohort, he voted for Biden. Having grown up in Texas, Benkert has excitedly watched his home state turn from staunchly red, to ambiguously purple. He volunteers with Young Invincibles, a young adult research & advocacy group and hopes to run for office one day.  “I think that it’s a privilege to vote in a deep red state like this,” he says. “Especially when turning Texas blue is within our grasp.” Not long ago, the suggestion of Texas going blue would have seemed implausible. But as Gen Z enters the political arena, such suggestions seem increasingly plausible.  CNBC Make It spoke with political analysts and most importantly, Gen Z voters, to learn how young people made their mark on the 2020 election — and how they might impact elections ahead.  Rosenberg says this year’s historic turnout of young voters was caused by “a perfect storm” of motivating factors “It wasn’t any one thing. It was a whole series of things. It was the economic and physical dislocation of Covid. It was climate change, which is a major issue for young people. It was the protests that we saw this spring and summer which really turned huge numbers of young people into political activism for the first time,” lists Rosenberg. “And it was the gun violence movement that came out of Parkland that I think also brought a lot of young people [into politics]. I mean, kids getting killed in schools, now that’s a motivator.” Cohen says young voters’ biggest concerns were the public health and economic implications of the coronavirus pandemic.  “But we also know that racial justice and systemic racism was a top, top issue for young people,” he adds. “And this is reflected in the fact that more than 80% of young people supported the racial justice movement that happened earlier this year.” The Black Lives Matter movement has been credited for inspiring vast numbers of young Democratic voters to register. In early June, millions of protesters took to the streets to speak out against the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  During the first half of that month, 1.1 million Americans registered to vote — a majority of them Democrats.  “Upwards of three-quarters of young people, regardless of party affiliation, supported Black Lives Matter protests. So for this particular demographic, that was hugely important,” says Cohen.  Bill McClain, research director for Clean and Prosperous America has spent significant time analyzing the political attitudes of Gen Z voters. He says the issues most important to these young voters are “defeating the coronavirus, jobs and the economy and climate change.” But he adds that what makes this generation unique, is how they approach issues as interconnected.  “What’s interesting to me in reviewing all of our research and listening to younger voters is that they recognize the intersectionality of all of these issues,” says McClain. “All of these issues are interwoven and young voters tend to take a more progressive attitude towards addressing each one of these issues.” Gen Z’s racial demographics also make them unique.  “The Millennial generation was the most diverse generation in the history of the United States. And then Generation Z came. And Generation Z is the most diverse generation in the history of the United States and I think you’re seeing that play out in voter preference,” says Cohen. “When you start to disaggregate the young vote based on race, you see different voting trends.” Exit polling suggests that young White voters disproportionately supported Trump, with 53% of White 18-to-29-year-olds voted for him.  But much greater percentages of young Black and Latino voters, who make up larger shares of America’s youngest generations than ever before, voted for Biden. “The demographic makeup of the electorate is changing, and you see that most notably among the young, who are much more racially and ethnically diverse,” says Bowman. “African-Americans and Hispanics tend to be more Democratic than White Americans overall. And the White share of the population is declining.” Many young first-time voters tell CNBC Make It that racial justice is among their top concerns.  “Black Lives Matter, police reform, that stuff right now is at the forefront of my mind,” says Jada Martin, a 21-year-old student at Strausberg University, originally from Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  “From racial justice to health care to the state of our planet, there’s a lot at stake right now and climate change really incorporates it all into one single issue that we really have a timestamp to tackle within the next 10 years,” says John Paul Mejia, an 18-year organizer with Sunrise Movement from Miami, Florida. “And knowing that we can’t face four more years of a Trump presidency is what really galvanized me to not only bring myself out to vote, but my communities as well.” Unsurprisingly, young voters on the left and right say that the communities they were raised in have significantly impacted their political opinions.  “The issues that my age group and I most care about are issues that include immigration, reproductive rights, climate change, health care [and] unemployment among so many others,” says Adela Aguirre, a 20-year-old college student from Boulder, Colorado. “The biggest issue for me that I focused on while voting was immigration, for sure. I have friends and family that are undocumented. So my vote definitely represented them.” “I voted for Trump because basically everyone from Monroe County, we’re real big Trump fans,” says Mackenzie Walden, 20 who works as a bank teller in Monroe County, Kentucky.  While Walden says she stands by most of Trump’s views, particularly on taxes and abortion issues, she says wishes he had handled the pandemic differently.  “That’s one thing I wish I could change about Trump,” she says. “I wish he was more of that professional type and more caring as far as this Covid goes.” Walden’s sister is currently battling coronavirus.  While young people have long had a reputation for leaning left, Rosenberg says Gen Z’s political preference is not a passing phase.  “There’s a great myth in life that young people are liberal when they’re young and then they’re more conservative when they get older. And that’s actually not true,” says Rosenberg. “Twenty years ago, 18 to 29-year-olds were 50/50 for Bush and Gore. It was dead even. There wasn’t a Democratic lean to young people in that era. And now, there’s sort of a substantial democratic lean in every election by between 10, 15 and then up to 35 points.” He continues, “There’s been a structural shift where young people are much more Democratic than they used to be.” The question is, how permanent is this shift?  “I think the real question for younger millennials and Gen Z is will the Republican Party ever be able to re-establish itself as a legitimate option?” asks Rosenberg. “Of course, the opportunity is there, but the combination of racial intolerance and sort of backwardness on climate, the way that Trump handled the protests and the rallies this spring and summer, I mean, Trump really was the sort of the antithesis of a lot of Gen Z and younger millennial values.” “I think there’s still a lot of opportunity for competition for the Republicans going forward. They have a lot of attractive candidates who may run in 2024,” says Bowman, also noting that Republicans have an opportunity to appeal to young Hispanic voters given Trump’s success in Florida. “That being said, I still think the group will lean heavily Democratic.” McClain emphasizes that this election should indicate to politicians the importance of reaching out to young voters.  “Younger voters are not contacted at the rate that old guys like me are contacted. So if we don’t invite them to the party, we cannot expect them to turn out. I think candidates and campaigns are waking up now to the fact that young voters are engaged,” he says. “And they’re the future of the country.” James Williams, an 18-year-old senior at Durant High School and a member of the YMCA’s Youth & Government Program from Plant City, Florida, chose to volunteer as a poll worker during his first election as an eligible voter. He says he sees similar political enthusiasm among his peers.  “I signed up to be a poll worker because I think it’s extremely important that as a youth, we not only have a say in our democracy, but we aid it,” says Williams. “Young people are finally realizing that in order to see change for whatever change you want to see, you have to vote.”  And Mejia says his generation’s political enthusiasm extends beyond voting.  “Throughout all of American history, from the civil rights [movement] to anti-Vietnam War protests, we’ve seen that young people have led the charge on every key social movement that has garnished and cemented institutional change in American society. And I think that’s what young people are really bringing to light now,” he says. “They’re saying, ‘You know what? Yeah, sure, this election is pretty high stakes, but we’re not going back to brunch once this is all over.’” Don’t miss: Get Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It ",www.cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/the-2020-election-shows-gen-zs-voting-power-for-years-to-come.html,© 2024 CNBC LLC.

,,The Michigan Jews who are voting ‘Uncommitted’ in the primary,,www.ynetnews.com,https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkb9gqk2t,
,,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus," Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively. Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest. To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.      u/baroquespoon (OP) has awarded 5 delta(s) in this post. All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in r/DeltaLog. Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended. Delta System Explained | Deltaboards So the issue here is the 3 positions you list at the end of your post. ""Accelerationism"" or parties being ""tge same"" is a popular strawman coming from a position of ignorance. The point, which can be discussed at length, is that centrists like Biden and their failures directly lead to far-right popularity. This phenomenon has been studied exhaustively. Now if you're talking exclusively voting strategy, the left does not subscribe to your theory of change. The left fundamentally wants to end the current system before the current system inevitably leads to catastrophe and understands that voting, or acting within the system, cannot work to that end. The left believes, and I think with good authority, that a figure like Trump is an inevitable product of the political and economic system as currently practiced and voting for a Biden does nothing to really solve that problem. You need to actually think this logic through more. So a person's character and actual decisions don't matter? Just as long as he's more left leaning than the other guy. Think about what this would mean for a conservative. Everytime you highlight something bad about Trump's personal life, or decision he's made that goes against the grain amongst conservatives, broken promises etc... that is all basically bullshit in your eyes. The only thing that matters is he's more right leaning than the other guy. Question: when we're talking about ""bad political calculus"" here, why is this framing explicitly around blaming voters for things they can't control? Maybe you consider this outside the scope of your view, but I don't really see the difference in spirit. You have a group of people saying, ""I don't want to vote for someone who does xyz,"" and the response is to berate them. Not to actually stop doing xyz. Not to run a candidate that isn't doing xyz. Just to continually tell them that they are evil and wrong If we expand this outside of ""the left,"" Biden's polling numbers are fucking awful with pretty much everyone except for anti-Trump republicans, who aren't going to vote for him anyway. We are a year out from the vote. Biden is, statistically, the worst person in the party (next to his VP), to run against Trump if you wan to win. Again, this is without ""the left."" Which continues to beg the question: who is the one making the ""bad political calculus"" here, really? ""The left"" generally believes that in a democracy, government power is derived from, and beholden to, the people. The idea that everyone has to just keep voting blue no matter what or who is antithetical to that idea I'm a right-wing person who will not vote for Trump. Is that bad political calculus? He's not yet the official nominee. If for some reason the nominee was someone else, that it would make sense to not vote for Biden. So the issue first, then the calculus. Biden is currently firmly in support of funding Israel and is in no way at all opposed to what the IDF is currently doing.
While I don't think Trump would have any more sympathy for Palestinians, I don't think he has any less sympathy either, once you hit the 'I literally don't care if you all die' point, you can't go lower.
Trump I also genuinely believe is actually less inclined to war with Iran or other countries than Biden would be.
Trump also personally hates Bibi Netanyahu. So if you're single issue voting, I would vote for Trump on that one issue. Now on the calculus itself, It's extremely clear what the democrats have been trying to do, They are essentially saying Option B is soooo bad that you MUST vote for Option A, and we REFUSE to negotiate or change any policies or anything on the Option A side. I think a valid response to that is to at the very least refuse to agree to vote for A. Make them do something, make them make some concession, make your vote conditional on changing policies to be something you want. The Democrats best case scenario right now would be for Biden to drop out entirely, refusing to vote for him would help accomplish that and you might get someone who could both beat Trump and have actual left leaning policies. In the longer term too though, if Biden does end up losing to Trump, you at least set the stage for the future.
When Clinton lost, they didn't learn any lessons, they blamed Bernie and Russians and Sexism all this stuff. With Biden there's gonna be no excuse, He will lose because he offered Nothing to anyone and was basically a Republican-lite. So then after the Trump Dictatorship ends upon his death in 2031 the dems might decide to stop trying to run Corporate Democrats in the next election.  To clarify, I have no issue with people threatening to not vote, as I think there is political calculus there. What I take issue with is the act of not voting itself, which is what I assume many people will happily follow through on. I want to understand their calculus at that juncture, not the threat beforehand. What is a threat that is not followed up on? Why would a left leaning person need to feel compelled to vote for a right wing candidate like Biden? I know Americans think that the Democrats are left wing but they're equivalent to European Christian democratic parties in policy. Biden's term has proven that he hasn't done anything significantly different to Trump. Children are still in cages, healthcare is still a luxury few can easily afford, they didn't codify Roe Vs Wade during the first two years where they had a majority in both Houses, they've increased the funding and arming of Israel and Saudi Arabia... need I go on? Unless the Democrats are forced to earn the votes of the Left, and those who feel there is no point to vote, then the cycle will continue. The lesser evil is not lesser if the only objective difference is rhetoric. ",www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/,
,,"U.S. Voters: Biden, Most in House Don't Deserve Another Term","WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fewer than four in 10 U.S. registered voters say President Joe Biden deserves to be reelected, while less than a quarter say the same about most members of the U.S. House. As is almost always the case, voters are more inclined to believe the U.S. representative from their own district should be returned to Congress, with 55% holding that view. These results are based on a Jan. 2-22 Gallup poll. The 38% of voters who say Biden deserves a second term is slightly lower than the 41% of Americans who approve of the job he is doing in the same survey. Voters are somewhat more willing to say Biden should be returned to office now than they were when Gallup last asked the question in June 2022 (33%), leading up to that year’s midterm elections. As would be expected, the vast majority of Democratic registered voters (82%) versus few Republican voters (3%) believe Biden should be reelected. At 29%, independent voters’ support for a second Biden term is much closer to that of Republicans than Democrats. Independents are the least likely party group to believe most members of Congress, and their own member, deserve to be reelected. Less than half of independents say their own representative should receive another term, compared with more than six in 10 Republicans and Democrats. In January of prior incumbent reelection years, Gallup asked whether former Presidents Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush deserved reelection. The same question was asked about George W. Bush (October 2003) and Barack Obama (December 2011) late in the years before they sought reelection. Of these, the younger Bush (who won reelection) had the highest reelect figure, at 53%, while two incumbents who lost, Trump at 50% and the elder Bush at 49%, scored just below. Although Biden’s current rating ranks lowest among the readings for the past six presidents, his 38% is most similar to Clinton’s 44% and Obama’s 43%, both of whom won a second term. Biden can take some solace in the fact that voter sentiment about whether a president deserves reelection has often changed over the course of prior election years. After receiving subpar reelection support early on, Obama and Clinton saw significant improvement, resulting in election wins: Conversely, two presidents saw their promising early readings dwindle between January and Election Day, to the point that they lost their reelection bids: The younger Bush’s reelection figures hovered around the 50% mark in three surveys leading up to the 2004 election, before he won a second term. Today’s congressional reelection figures are also lower than is typical for early readings in presidential election years. Slightly fewer U.S. registered voters in 2012 and 2016 thought their local representative deserved to be reelected than do now, but 60% or more did so in other years. The 24% who believe most members deserve reelection is lower than in all recent presidential election years except 2012, when 20% held that view in the late 2011 survey. The current figure is similar to that from 2016, but in all other years, 35% or more thought most members should be reelected, including a majority of 56% in 2000. Voters’ opinions of whether members of Congress deserve reelection have usually not changed much over the course of presidential election years. There have been exceptions, though -- as in 1992, when voters became much less inclined to want to reelect members, and in 2012, when there were modest increases in incumbent reelection sentiments. Voters are not enthusiastic about returning most elected federal officials to office. Biden trails other incumbents at similar points in their presidencies, and voters are less likely than in other recent election years to say members of Congress deserve reelection. While the numbers for Congress are unlikely to improve, based on historical patterns, Biden’s numbers could. He hopes to follow the paths of Clinton and Obama, whose electoral fortunes improved during their reelection years and saw them win second terms, rather than those of Trump and the elder George Bush, whose support for a second term deteriorated over the course of the election year.

,,,"            67     by AHTRA ELNASHAR | The National Desk WASHINGTON (TND) — Voters in Michigan who are angry with President Joe Biden over his support for Israel have sent his campaign a loud and clear message: He cannot take their support for granted. An effort to protest the president by voting ""uncommitted"" in the state's presidential primary -- called the 'Listen to Michigan' campaign -- on Feb. 27 gained momentum after prominent progressive organization Our Revolution announced its support for the plan. ""Tell Biden, stop the death and destruction now"" the group's pledge sign up page reads. Attendees wave flags and fly signs during a rally in support of Palestine in Dearborn, Detroit on Oct. 10, 2023. (Matthew Hatcher/Detroit News via AP) As of Monday, the death toll in Gaza since October 7 exceeded 29,000, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. While some staunch critics refuse to recognize any statistics from Hamas, the United Nations has said the ministry's figures have been historically consistent with their own. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has also endorsed the protest vote. The president is aware of the pushback: Earlier this month he sent top aides to Michigan to meet with Arab and Muslim community leaders. Those two groups represent a voting bloc Biden cannot afford to lose. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 206,000 Muslim registered voters, according to Emgage, a network of organizations focused on Muslim political engagement. Biden's attempt at outreach also comes after a November poll from the Arab American Institute found that his support among Arab voters plummeted from 2020, especially in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, when it was 60% to a mere 19%.

Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said she's had tough conversations with the president about this. ""I’ve got a lot of constituents, a lot of people that are neighbors and friends who are hurting, who have lost family, are scared for their family who have no food, no health care, no water. This is an issue that he’s got to talk about with people head-on. Donald Trump doesn’t offer any solutions, either,"" Dingell said in an interview with Fox News Monday. Some Democrats, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who also serves as co-chair for Biden's reelection campaign, have urged members of her party to keep up their support for the president instead of inadvertently helping former President Donald Trump, who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. El-Sayed pushed back on criticism that it will benefit Trump, emphasizing the protest vote's focus is on the Democratic primary, not necessarily the general election. ""While it’s clear that Biden will win the primary, it’s critical for him and his team to understand that votes in November have to be EARNED. And by voting uncommitted, I have the opportunity to count myself among the votes he’s putting in jeopardy in November,"" El-Sayed said in his post.

Biden's harshest public remarks about Israel came earlier this month when he called its conduct in the Gaza Strip ""over the top."" In private, Biden reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “pain in my a**."" The U.S., along with Qatar and Egypt, have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel on a potential deal for the release of hostages in exchange for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the president has not joined calls by other world leaders in calling for a permanent ceasefire.

,,AP Decision Notes: What to expect in the South Carolina Republican presidential primary,"FOX 5 San Diego & KUSI News   by: ROBERT YOON, Associated Press Posted: Feb 21, 2024 / 08:58 AM PST Updated: Feb 21, 2024 / 09:00 AM PST    WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off Saturday in South Carolina’s first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary, the first head-to-head matchup for the last two remaining major candidates since the New Hampshire primary a month ago. The contest takes place on Haley’s home turf. She was South Carolina’s governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base. Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet. Haley has increasingly questioned Trump’s fitness for office, most recently criticizing his comments on Russia and NATO. It is a marked contrast from earlier in the campaign when she and other GOP hopefuls avoided criticizing Trump directly. The South Carolina primary is usually an indicator of which candidate will win the Republican presidential nomination. Since the modern version of the state’s primary began in 1980, all but one GOP primary winner has gone on to win the party’s nomination. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012. A look at what to expect on election night: The primary will be held Saturday and polls will close statewide at 7 p.m. EST. The ballot will list Ryan Binkley, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, David Stuckenberg, and Trump. South Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party’s primary. But voters may only participate in one party’s presidential primary, so people who voted in the Democratic primary on Feb. 3 may not vote in the Republican contest. Only about 4% of registered voters cast ballots in the Democratic contest, leaving the bulk of the electorate, including any Democrats and independents who favor Haley over Trump and didn’t vote in the earlier contest, eligible to weigh in on the Republican race. There are 50 delegates at stake and 29 will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Twenty-one delegates will be allocated according to the vote in each of the state’s seven congressional districts. The top vote-getter in each district will get three delegates from that district. The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state’s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics. Republican electoral politics have changed dramatically since the last time Haley and Trump each faced other Republican candidates in the Palmetto State. Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday’s primary. In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley’s strongest showings and some of Trump’s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections. Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. Haley’s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump. The results are broadly consistent with Haley’s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas. These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties. The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why. There are about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. Voters do not register by party. Turnout in the 2016 Republican primary was about 25% of registered voters. It was about 22% in the 2012 primary. Saturday’s contest will be the first Republican presidential primary held in the state since a new early voting law was enacted in May 2022. The law allows voters to cast ballots in-person before Election Day without an excuse. The early voting period for the GOP primary is Feb. 12-22, excluding Feb. 18-19. In the 2016 Republican primary, when voters had to provide an excuse to cast an absentee ballot, about 8% of votes were cast before Election Day. In the 2022 midterm primaries, after the new law went into effect, pre-Election Day voting was at about 21%. About 36% of votes cast in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary were before Election Day. As of Tuesday night, more than 139,000 voters had cast their ballots. In the 2024 South Carolina Democratic primary, the AP first reported results at 7:08 p.m. EST. Primary night tabulation ended at 10:47 p.m. EST with nearly 100% of votes counted. As of Saturday, there will be 142 days until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and 255 until the November general election.   Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

,,James Biden tells GOP lawmakers that Joe Biden had no involvement in the family’s business dealings,"KXAN Austin   by: FARNOUSH AMIRI, Associated Press Posted: Feb 21, 2024 / 02:22 PM CST Updated: Feb 21, 2024 / 02:25 PM CST    WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden “never had any involvement” in the business dealings of other members of his family, his brother James Biden testified Wednesday as he appeared for a voluntary private interview on Capitol Hill as part of House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry. “I have had a 50-year career in a variety of business ventures. Joe Biden has never had any involvement or any direct or indirect financial interest in those activities,” the president’s younger brother said in a 10-page opening statement to lawmakers obtained by The Associated Press. “None.” The interview with James Biden is the latest in a series that GOP lawmakers have conducted recently as they seek to rebuild momentum for an impeachment process surrounding the Biden family’s overseas finances that has stalled in recent months. Criticism over the lack of evidence directly related to the president has grown even among those in the Republican Party who have thrown cold water on allegations that Biden was directly involved in his family members’ supposed efforts to leverage the last name into corporate paydays domestically and abroad. The GOP investigation was undercut again last week when an FBI informant who claimed there was a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving the president, his son Hunter, and a Ukrainian energy company was charged with fabricating the story. The informant’s claims had been central to the Republican effort in Congress to investigate the president and his family, with investigators even making mention of the unsubstantiated claim in letters to prospective witnesses. An attorney for Hunter Biden, who is expected to give a deposition next week, said the charges show the probe is “based on dishonest, uncredible allegations and witnesses.” Both James and Hunter Biden were subpoenaed by the committee in November. Lawyers for James Biden have said that there was no justification for the subpoena because the committee had already reviewed private bank records and transactions between the two brothers. The committee found records of two loans that were made when Joe Biden was not in office or a candidate for president. The impeachment inquiry, which began in September under the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, has included the recent depositions of several former Biden family associates. In nearly every one of those interviews, the witnesses have stated that they have seen no evidence that Joe Biden was directly involved in his son or brother’s business ventures. Nonetheless, Republicans, led by Oversight Chairman, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, have said they are pushing ahead with an inquiry that could result in impeachment charges against Biden, the ultimate penalty for what the Constitution describes as “high crimes and misdemeanors.” There had been private discussions about bringing articles of impeachment against Biden to the House floor for a vote in February but those conversations have stalled as support for the effort has waned among the majority. House Republicans instead shifted their focus in the new year to holding Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas accountable for his handling of the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. Last week, the razor-thin GOP majority barely managed to impeach Mayorkas, reflecting political desperation as Republicans struggle to make good on the priorities they campaigned on. The attention is now expected to shift back to the impeachment of Joe Biden as Republicans look to detract attention from the various legal challenges plaguing former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner for reelection in November. House Democrats have remained united against the monthslong impeachment effort and have called on Republicans to end what they call a “sham process.” Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said that James Biden is the latest example of Republicans playing political games with no sign of tangible evidence that would rise to the level of impeaching a president. “We obviously again have heard nothing indicating that Joe Biden had anything to do with business ventures of Hunter Biden, or James Biden, and nothing has contradicted that basic understanding we’ve had for many, many months now,” Raskin told reporters when the interview broke for lunch. But Republicans have pushed back on the Biden family’s defense, saying the evidence they have gathered since early last year paints a troubling picture of “influence peddling” in the family’s business dealings, particularly with international clients. “With my appearance here today, the committees will have the information to conclude that the negative and destructive assumptions about me and my relationship with my brother Joe are wrong,” James Biden said in his statement. “There is no basis for this inquiry to continue.” ___ Associated Press video journalist Dan Huff contributed to this report.

Credit: Sam Wolfe/Reuters Greenville, South Carolina (CNN) — Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Tuesday reiterated her plans to continue her White House bid against former President Donald Trump, just five days ahead of the South Carolina Primary. “Some of you—perhaps a few of you in the media—came here today to see if I’m dropping out of the race. Well, I’m not. Far from it,” Haley said in a speech in Greenville. Haley vowed she is not exiting the race now, saying she will continue to compete in the primary past the South Carolina primary and through Super Tuesday on March 5. “That’s why I refuse to quit. South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I’ll still be running for president. I’m not going anywhere,” she said. “I’m campaigning every day, until the last person votes, because I believe in a better America and a brighter future for our kids.” Haley’s remark come as she continues to challenge Trump for the GOP nomination, though he has won every delegate contest so far and holds a wide lead over Haley in her own home state, making many question the path forward for the former governor’s campaign. Haley had previously said that she had to do better in the South Carolina primary than she did in New Hampshire primary – where she lost to Trump by 11 points – but she is no longer saying that she must hit that goal. Polls consistently show Haley trailing Trump in South Carolina by a considerable margin. According to the latest new CBS/YouGov survey, Trump leads Haley among likely voters in South Carolina’s upcoming Republican primary, 65% to 30%. Those results echo previous Monmouth University-Washington Post polling, which also found Trump taking majority support. Haley made her case for staying in the race by pointing to a number of factors, including her view that some politicians who embrace Trump publicly “privately dread him.” “Look, I get it. In politics, the herd mentality is enormously strong. A lot of Republican politicians have surrendered to it… Of course, many of the same politicians who now publicly embrace Trump privately dread him. They know what a disaster he’s been and will continue to be for our party. They’re just too afraid to say it out loud,” Haley said. But Haley did not lay out how she could clinch enough delegates to win the nomination. Instead, Haley again argued Americans have a “right to have their voices heard,” adding “we don’t anoint kings in the country.” “They deserve a real choice, not a Soviet-style election where there’s only one candidate and he gets 99% of the vote. We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don’t rig elections!,” she said. The Trump campaign sought to undercut Haley’s message by releasing a memo hours before Haley’s speech, arguing their calculations show Trump will earn the number of delegates needed to become the Republican nominee by March 19 at the latest and that Haley’s campaign was “out of gas.” “The true ‘state’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign? Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump,” Trump campaign managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles wrote in the memo. The memo reads, “Nikki Haley’s campaign ends Saturday, February 24th, fittingly, in her home state, rejected by those who know her the best.” Trump has been in South Carolina for a single event since the New Hampshire primary and he will be back in the state on Tuesday night for a town hall with Fox News. Pitching herself as the best alternative to both President Joe Biden and Trump, Haley again painted both leaders as ”two old men who are only getting older,” and accused them both of polarizing the country. “The truth is, Americans already know what Joe Biden and Donald Trump will do. But we’re just as concerned with who they are. They’re dividers at a time when America desperately, urgently, needs a uniter,” Haley said as she continued to offer a message of unity. “In the America I know and love, we disagree strongly, but we do it without hating each other, and we still have a shared national purpose. In the America I know and love, we respect freedom and the rule of law, we refuse to use the awesome power of big government to punish those we dislike, and we recognize that America has done more good for more people than any country in the world.” BY VISIT FLORIDA Escape the cold and experience the magic of winter in Florida.

,,'They have not earned your vote': Trump allies urge Georgia Republicans to sit out Senate runoffs,"Allies of President Donald Trump's efforts to challenge last month's election urged Republicans in Georgia on Wednesday to stay at home for the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, arguing Trump supporters shouldn't take part in another ""rigged election."" Attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell told a crowd of Trump loyalists not to vote for either of the two Georgia incumbent Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue, during a ""Stop the Steal"" gathering in Alpharetta, Georgia.  The event, billed as a press conference but resembling the raucousness of a Trump rally, was filled with unfounded claims about  the election won by President-elect Joe Biden. Attention also turned to the two runoff elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate. ""Where is Kelly Loeffler here? Where is David Perdue?"" said Wood, who unsuccessfully sued Georgia seeking to stop the presidential election's certification. ""He ought to be standing right here. ""Do not be fooled twice,"" he added. ""This is Georgia. We ain't dumb. We're not going to vote on Jan. 5 on another machine made by China. You're not going to fool Georgians again. If Kelly Loeffler wants your vote, if David Perdue wants your vote, they've got to earn it."" Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide 'It has to stop': Georgia official calls on Trump to 'stop inspiring' death threats over election Georgia election officials have been under fire from Trump and his supporters after an initial state-ordered recount affirmed that Biden won Georgia by 12,284 votes. The Trump campaign requested a second recount, which was expected to be released Thursday. The remarks underscored the delicate politics the two Republican senators must navigate to turn out a base convinced the presidential election was stolen. Trump, who is holding a rally Saturday for Perdue and Loeffler in Valdosta, Georgia, has urged Republicans to vote for the senators even if they're upset with the presidential election outcome. But Wood said the Georgia senators must ""demand publicly, repeatedly, consistently"" for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to call a special legislative session to address the 2020 presidential election. ""And if they do not do it, they have not earned your vote. Don't you give it to them. Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election? For God's sake, fix it. You've got to fix it before you do it again."" Neither Loeffler, running against Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock, nor Perdue, running against Democrat Jon Ossoff, attended the rally. Kemp has said state law prohibits him from ""interfering"" with an election. 'Fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation':Georgia official says Trump supporters misled Wood delved into the Senate runoff elections after Georgia Rep. Vernon Jones, a Democratic lawmaker who had endorsed Trump during the campaign, repeatedly urged the crowd to ""hold the line"" by voting for Loeffler and Perdue. ""Now I love Vernon Jones,"" Wood said. ""Vernon Jones and I are more alike than different, but I'm going to disagree with Vernon Jones."" Powell, a conservative former prosecutor and former Trump attorney, doubled down on claims she has pushed for weeks that an algorithm flipped votes from Trump to Biden. She also urged Georgia Republicans to sit out the January election. ""There should not be a runoff, certainly not on Dominion machines,"" Powell said, referring to the voting machine company. ""I think I would encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure. And I mean that, regardless of party. We can't live in a free republic unless we know our votes are legal and secure."" She said  Georgia must adopt voter identification and paper ballots – both of which are already used in the state – as well as require thumbprints on absentee ballots. More:Attorney General Barr says Justice Dept. finds no evidence of fraud to alter election outcome At one point, Wood led chants of ""Do your job!"" aimed at U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who told The Associated Press this week that his department has found no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have changed the outcome of the election. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting implementation system manager, said, ""We encourage all voters to vote in an election"" in response to the pleas from Wood and Powell. He said Powell lied when she said algorithms flipped votes, noting that a hand recount of the results reaffirmed Biden won the election by more than 12,000 votes. Sterling also said Powell lied when, in response to a question from the crowd, she accused the Georgia secretary of state's office of not conducting an actual hand recount. ""They lied to the people who are believing them to their face,"" he said. ""It's this kind of lying and this kind of rhetoric that is continuing to inflame passions on the ground unnecessarily, and it's wrong."" Reach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.

,,"White House ‘extremely upset’ with coverage of Biden’s age, says New York Times publisher","A. G. Sulzberger said the liberal-leaning newspaper would not tone down its coverage of the 81-year-old president or act as his ‘lapdog’ The White House is “extremely upset” with press coverage of Joe Biden’s age, the publisher of the New York Times said. A. G. Sulzberger, the former chairman of the New York Times Company, said his liberal-leaning newspaper powerhouse would not tone down its coverage of the 81-year-old president or act as his “lapdog”. It comes after a justice department report found that Mr Biden was unable to recall the years when he was vice president or when his son died of brain cancer, prompting a fiery response from the White House. “He is a historically unpopular incumbent and the oldest man to ever hold this office,” Mr Sulzberger said in an interview with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. “We’ve reported on both of those realities extensively, and the White House has been extremely upset about it.” Mr Sulzberger added that he was not drawing a comparison with Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner who is entangled in a number of criminal and civil cases across the country. “We are not saying that this is the same as [Mr Trump’s] five court cases or that they are even,” he said. “They are different. But they are both true, and the public needs to know both those things.” “And if you are hyping up one side or downplaying the other, no side has a reason to trust you in the long run.” He added: “We are not anyone’s opposition and we’re not anyone’s lap dog.” Mr Biden has long had a reputation as a “gaffe machine”, but questions about his mental acuity have grown after a justice department report into his handling of classified documents found he had “significant” memory limitations. Robert Hur, the special counsel, said the 81-year-old struggled to remember key dates, and did not recommend charges against him because he “would likely present himself to a jury… as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory”. White House lawyers urged the justice department to remove the “denigrating” remarks from the report before its publication earlier this month, but their efforts were rebuffed. The Biden administration has since sought to cast doubt on the investigation’s findings by claiming that Mr Hur had violated the department’s policies and traditions. Mr Biden hit back at the claims in a furious press conference hours after the report’s publication, but in the process managed to confuse the leaders of Mexico and Egypt. Kamala Harris, the vice president, claimed the investigation was “clearly politically motivated” and argued that it should have shown a “higher level of integrity”. A White House spokesman suggested Mr Hur had been swayed by a partisan political environment, and that his comments were an attempt to ward off attacks by Republicans.

,,Understanding Election 2024 is more than just reading polls," ‘Outnumbered’ panel on concerns with President Biden ahead of the election and the president confusing Ukraine with NATO For months now, I’ve been deflecting questions about polling of the 2024 general election – which increasingly looks to be a rerun of 2020’s match-up of Trump v. Biden: Don’t ask election analysts who will win … ask an economist or a foreign policy expert.  For former President Donald Trump, polling right now looks pretty good. So good, in fact, that it’s blunted what looked to be a core argument of Trump’s Republican challengers – ""I’ll pursue Trump’s policies – and I’ll win the election."" (""Unlike him"" – an unspoken tagline that’s proving ineffective given recent polls.)  The Democrats respond by trying to camouflage the scratches of panic from their throats – ""polls a year away don’t matter"" … ""the election will change once folks think about the choice"" and my all-time favorite ""the abortion issue will work (just like in 2022).""   TRUMP HOLDS LARGE LEAD OVER HALEY 4 DAYS FROM SOUTH CAROLINA GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY They almost sound like they’ve convinced themselves. (FYI: They haven’t.)  President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are likely caught in an unusual battle of incumbents. (Getty Images) Polls this year are likely to be hard to read and interpret.   That’s particularly true because – as we wrote earlier – there appear to be essentially two incumbents running – each with their records and personalities that the public can judge.  The likely GOP candidate is one of the most polarizing figures in modern political history. Whatever folks – supporters and opponents alike – think of Trump today, in December 2023, is unlikely to change between now and November. The only way to paint Trump is to use primary colors.   President Joe Biden, by contrast, is one of the least colorful national political figures in recent memory, a view completely consistent with his favorite ice cream flavor – vanilla. After he won the South Carolina primary in 2020, Democrats didn’t so much rally to his side as they got in line and breathed a collective sigh of, ""Oh, well, OK, Biden’s fine.""   This year, that gets complicated by the regular occurrence of apparent stumbles in memory or leaving the stage – and, last week, the special counsel’s assessment that Biden would come off as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""  Especially in the polarized political environment of 2024, at best, it makes it harder for potential Democrat voters to decide to vote for Biden – and makes it easier for reluctant GOP voters to decide that they’d prefer to get back to Trump.  The two contrasting metaphors were borne out in recent polling.   While Trump basically holds steady in most polls – in the high 40s, Biden bounces around from poll to poll – more often behind Trump – but sometimes ahead. In all cases, analysts pore over the data looking for an explanation for why the race has changed.  Capitol police make arrests at Mennonite protest calling for Gaza ceasefire in Cannon Rotunda. How Biden handles Israel's war against Hamas terrorists is one of five key issues this election. (Fox News) Unlike Trump – whose Republican base has solidified in recent months – Democrats have been hesitant to evince support for their leader – indeed, the biggest variable of Biden’s standing, tends to be young voters or minority voters.   They remain unenthusiastic – even skeptical – of Biden. One sees that, most clearly, in the most recent Fox polls (Michigan and North Carolina). In each, Trump gets the same percentage vote he got in 2020. Trump’s vote is baked in, but Biden’s vote is in question.  What are the implications for November?  Rather than reading polls and looking at the difference between the two – the way the headlines like to shout [Trump leads Biden by 2, no, Biden leads Trump by 1.] – one should focus on each candidate’s number – and each one’s standing with their traditional supporters. Trump is almost always hovering around 47%.   For Trump – that means looking at both the level of his support – and the enthusiasm of his supporters. In the wake of four indictments, and cases arguing that he should be kept off the ballot in some states, we’ve seen his support strengthen – both the enthusiasm of solid supporters, and apparent growth among voters who liked him and seemed to be considering other candidates.   The enthusiasm that enabled Trump to outperform polling expectations in both 2016 and 2020 seems to still be there among Republicans. It’s why his number in general election polling still hovers between 45 and 50. To the extent that the election is a referendum on Trump, the vast bulk of his 2016 and 2020 supporters thinks things were just better when he was president.  The political shape of the electorate is fairly clear – and it’s not moving. About 47% (almost half) of the country supports Trump – and that number doesn’t move. The remaining roughly 53% (a bit more than half) are not supporting him – and there are few if any indications that they could move in his direction.   Which – importantly – does not mean that they’re ready to support Biden. Indeed, all polls suggest many are very much not ready to vote for Biden. And, voting in America is never an either/or option: Voters can vote for one of the two major party candidates, they can vote for a third-party nominee (there will be a bunch this November), or they can just stay home.  Hundreds of migrants, predominantly from Venezuela, cross the Rio Grande with the intention of seeking humanitarian asylum by crossing the border between Mexico and the United States in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on December 05, 2023.  (David Peinado/Anadolu via Getty Images) But Biden is a very different political character from Trump. While Trump voters may think he’s corrupt or unconstitutionally elected – the remaining 53% range from those who are disappointed by inflation, opposed to his policies or somewhat lukewarm to his administration’s accomplishments.  And that’s underscored by attitudes about his age and his weak on-camera appearances.   The age issue gets amplified essentially every time one sees him walk to the podium or speak in a way that makes it appear he’s searching for a word. And it was especially newsworthy when Special Counsel Robert Hur explained that at a potential trial, Biden would appear to the jury as a ""sympathetic, elderly man with a poor memory.""   Not exactly the kind of person one would want on a debate stage, let alone facing off against President Xi Jinping of China, or President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Questions about his age make it harder – even for solid Democrats – to articulate a desire to vote for Biden.  But I’d argue that Biden’s standing – with the 53% of American electorate who might vote for him – depends less on what potential Biden voters think about him personally today (what shows up in polls), and much more sensitive to what they think about the situation facing the U.S. – and his age – looks like in October.  More than many presidents, Biden’s fingerprints are all over five domestic and global issues: (The issue of border security, Biden’s embrace of Ukraine, his support of Israel, his legislative programs to compete with China (the CHIPs act), and his efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy. Voters’ views of Biden will hinge very much on the outcome of those actions.  I’m neither an economist nor an international relations expert – but what we’ve seen politically bears that out. The border security issue is turning into a political tug of war over the failure of a bipartisan compromise. Ukraine looks at best a stalemate. The Israel-Hamas war is, right now, ugly. And while inflation seems to be subsiding and the economy doesn’t look headed to a recession, prices, especially grocery prices, are still higher than they were when he took office. And China … well … who knows?  So, don’t look at the polling, look at a calendar – and consider whether any – or all – of the above are likely to change.   Which – importantly – does not mean that they’re ready to support Biden. Indeed, all polls suggest many are very much not ready to vote for Biden. And, voting in America is never an either/or option: Voters can vote for one of the two major party candidates, they can vote for a third-party nominee (there will be a bunch this November), or they can just stay home.  The Gaza war will look very different in six months. The Biden team is mounting a full-court press to get to some kind of resolution. He may show signs of progress – or further signs of ugliness.  The Ukrainians are currently struggling. In six months, folks who say we’re wasting our money will find their argument more salient – or less – if things go differently.  Some people say that foreign policy issues rarely affect U.S. elections. True, but note that Biden’s job approval numbers – which started high, actually only turned negative in the wake of the disastrous pullout from Afghanistan. They went south because he lost an aura of competence – and they will either turn around – or firm negative depending on the impact of other foreign events.   My own view is simple. Yes, the public doesn’t vote based on a president’s foreign policies – but high-profile actions on the world stage do affect whether they think the president is essentially competent – or incompetent.  Biden's poor handling of the Afghanistan pullout set in motion other criticisms of his leadership.

(AP/Abdul Khaliq) And then there’s the apparent failure of the border bill, which the Biden people are trying to blame on Trump, while the Republicans say it wasn’t good enough.  Finally, there’s the economy – typically the most important factor in U.S. elections. There’s been some good economic news – but so far, we’ve seen very little impact on Biden’s anemic polling. That may change – if the economic news continues to be positive, especially on inflation.  The bottom line for Biden, he should worry less about his poll numbers than making sure the actual results he delivers are welcomed by the electorate.  That’s especially true given his age. Biden is not the first incumbent to face serious questions about his age and failing memory. Ronald Reagan stumbled in his first 1984 debate when he looked almost to be suffering from aphasia (the inability to find a word).   It led to a two-week firestorm about Reagan’s age. The popular wisdom is that he defused it with a timely joke in the second debate.   Was it the joke or was it the reality that voters felt the Reagan administration had achieved real results in the economy and with the U.S. standing in the world?   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Some folks believe Biden should make himself more ""available"" for unscripted TV viewers. Given every interview and speech I’ve seen, that’s a recipe for further challenges. Instead, he really needs to seek to ensure that voters conclude that this ""well-meaning elderly man"" has led an administration that has delivered results that voters can feel.   The polls today suggest that that’s precisely what they haven’t done.  The enthusiasm that enabled Trump to outperform polling expectations in both 2016 and 2020 seems to still be there among Republicans. It’s why his number in general election polling still hovers between 45 and 50. To the extent that the election is a referendum on Trump, the vast bulk of his 2016 and 2020 supporters thinks things were just better when he was president.

,,,"   Stay up to speed on all the latest local and national political news. Nikki Haley's team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina's Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she'll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Video above: Nikki Haley vows to stay in the race during 'State of the Race' speech in South Carolina During a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told voters in South Carolina that she is not dropping out of the race. That's even as Donald Trump's MAGA movement is furious that she's refusing to drop out. After all, she's the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out. But she told The Associated Press that she's not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that's even if she's blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday's South Carolina primary. ""Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn't Russia. We don't want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,"" Haley said. ""What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?"" In case you don't believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. Video below: Trump and Haley Face Off in South Carolina Republican Presidential Primary    She's spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Just don't ask Haley which primary state she's going to win. It's a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren't willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can't. That's because polls suggest she's a major underdog in virtually every state – even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor – given Trump's grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party's most energized partisans – not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. ""Instead of asking me what states I'm gonna win, why don't we ask how he's gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?"" she said. Still, Haley's team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump – especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allow a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. Stop us if you've heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he's betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump's legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There's also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren't ready to surrender to Trump's MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, ""We're not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the altar of Donald Trump."" Haley's campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone – her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. As Trump calls Haley names like ""stupid"" and ""birdbrain,"" Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president's legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much – or more – time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump's political standing would change dramatically if he's a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal ""piggy bank"" for his legal fees. ""People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,"" Haley said. ""He's going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?"" And she didn't exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. ""Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he's going to have to defend himself,"" she said in drawing a clear distinction. Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party's July national convention. But Haley said she isn't yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she'd drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party's presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that's likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she'd help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. ""I don't know what actions I'm gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,"" Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn't feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. ""I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,"" Haley said. ""I'm running as a Republican. That's my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.""

Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the US elections. This is Shereena Qazi, taking over from Joseph Stepansky. The outcome of the presidential elections will have little effect on US-Europe trade relations, France’s finance chief asserted, saying Washington is unlikely to drop its confrontational stance whether Trump wins or not.      The US administration has inflicted billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on European imports over the past four years, with Trump claiming unfair barriers against American firms trying to compete on continental markets. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeated his country’s stance on the US presidential race, saying it is not important who wins but what actions the next president takes towards sanctions on Iran. “What is important for us is that America returns to respecting the Iranian nation. We want respect instead of sanctions, no matter who is [in office]. If he lifts the unfair and illegal sanctions and replaces them with respect, then our situation will be different,” Rouhani said in a televised speech. 4 Nov 2020 - 12:32 GMT German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warns the US is facing a “very explosive situation” and a possible systemic crisis after Trump prematurely declared election victory. Following Trump’s remarks that he will go to the Supreme Court to stop ballots from being tallied, Kramp-Karrenbauer told public broadcaster ZDF: “This election has not been decided … votes are still being counted.” She said Trump could create “a constitutional crisis in the USA”, calling such a scenario “something that must deeply concern us”. Despite incomplete results from several battleground states that could determine the outcome of the US presidential race, Trump prematurely claimed victory over Biden. The move confirmed worries that Trump would seek to dispute the election results. Read more here about the different ways the election can be contested. The Associated Press news agency has not declared a winner in Wisconsin’s presidential contest because the race between Trump and Biden is too early to call. Trump, who is locked in a tight battle with Biden to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win, prematurely claimed early on Wednesday that he was “winning” the state. Biden is ahead of Trump by fewer than 8,000 votes out of nearly 3.2 million cast. Gold fell more than 1 percent as the dollar emerged as the favoured safe haven from a much closer presidential race than investors expected following Trump’s strong performance in some swing states.  Spot gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,887.76 an ounce by 11:02 GMT. US gold futures dropped 1.2 percent to $1,888. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against major currencies. Chinese social media users watched election day in the US with bemusement and mockery, as Trump complained of a “major fraud on our nation” and prematurely claimed victory. “Whether he wins or loses, his final mission is to destroy the appearance of American democracy,” one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform wrote. “Let Trump be re-elected and take the US downhill,” another wrote. Relations between China and the US are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing. Biden’s campaign manager called Trump’s call for vote counting to stop “outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect”. “It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” said Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon. “It was unprecedented because never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election. “And it was incorrect because it will not happen. The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted.” The AP news agency issued a bulletin saying it is not calling the presidential race yet, despite Trump’s claims of victory, because neither candidate has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. Speaking from the White House at 02:30 ET, Trump said: “Frankly, we did win this election.”  The president said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of mail ballots. “His assertion of victory does not match the results and information currently available to the AP,” the news service reported. Several key states are too early to call, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan the agency said. Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland has sent this report from Tucson, Arizona. Democrat Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat for Arizona, beating Republican Martha McSally for the seat once held by Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018. “Tonight is not about celebrating, tonight is about getting to work,” Kelly told a small crowd in Tucson earlier in the evening. He spoke about the hardships Arizonans have faced owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying many small businesses are in peril in the southwest state. The Democrat leader said he would strive for policies to set back Trump’s crackdown on immigration, lowering healthcare costs and the need to “rebuild the economy – and it’s going to be a massive undertaking”. A centrist Democrat and former astronaut, Kelly first opened a large lead over McSally as the vote counting got under way in the southwest state.   4 Nov 2020 - 08:05 GMT Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. At 2:30am (07:30 GMT), the presidential race in North Carolina was still too close to call. Trump was leading Biden by about 76,700 votes, with 95 percent of expected votes counted. According to the State Board of Elections, roughly 117,000 absentee ballots have not yet been returned. Those ballots, if postmarked by Election Day, can still be counted if they arrive by November 12. The close race did not stop Trump from prematurely declaring “a big win in North Carolina” during televised remarks early on Wednesday morning. Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency. Democratic presidential Biden and senate candidate Kelly have been declared the winners in Arizona, according to the AP news agency. The win gives Biden 11 votes in the Electoral College that Trump had won in 2016. Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, a Republican, had endorsed Biden. Biden got strong support from voters in the Phoenix area, Maricopa County, where the majority of the state’s population resides. Read more here 4 Nov 2020 - 07:46 GMT President Trump prematurely claims victory in the presidential election, before vote counting has ended, and suggested Democrats were engaged in fraud as key states continued to count hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump said in remarks from the White House. Trump claimed he is winning in key states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin – that have just begun to count mail ballots likely to favour Biden.

Democratic US Senator Tina Smith defeats Republican Jason Lewis in Minnesota’s US Senate race, according to the AP. Trump has won Texas and its 38 electoral votes. Omar has won a second term in the Congress Minnesota’s 5th congressional district in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Omar, 38, defeated her Republican challenger, African American businessman Lacy Johnson, by 64.6 percent of the vote to 25.9 percent, according to the AP news agency with 99 percent of votes counted. Read more here   I’ve worked on the White House grounds for 7 years and I’ve never seen this much media on the north lawn. #Election2020 pic.twitter.com/iH0xjQ7swJ — Chris Sheridan (@ChrisSheridan34) November 4, 2020 Trump, in a tweet, has made unfounded accusations that the Democrats would attempt to “steal” the election from him, without citing any evidence. He also predicted a “big” win for himself. We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020 Twitter labelled his tweet as making a “potentially misleading claim about an election”.
Trump’s tweets came immediately after a statement from Biden, who said he was optimistic about his prospects of winning. Biden spoke from Delaware shortly after midnight, saying he is optimistic he is going to win the US presidential election. “We knew this was going to go long … but look, we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election,” Biden said. “It ain’t over ‘til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted. “We are confident about Arizona … We’re also just calling for Minnesota and we are still in the game in Georgia … And we are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan … We are going to win in Pennsylvania. Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”   Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight. Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes. Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory. At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column. Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results. Read more here The AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes. The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes. Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign. While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”. Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from Pennsylvania On Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day. “Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said. “We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.” The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes. The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes. 4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMT Reynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night. “It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.” Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, Wisconsin As polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans. Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in. Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday. “Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.” Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs. “For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.” Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency. Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects. Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter. It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two. This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.      Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint. His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period. For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day. Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race. Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race. The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes. 4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMT AP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes. The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes. The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes. It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this report The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state. “I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.” Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations. Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.   Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas. “Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”    The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes. “This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida. “Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.” He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.” “There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.   Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones. Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question. Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat. 4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMT Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives. The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortez made history in 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.  Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston. The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.   South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison. Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina. But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight. The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes. It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa. Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency. This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate. Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate. If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50. “There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.” “Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said. The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes. Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count. “The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said. “So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.” People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media. The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday. Read more here. Trying to balance out all that #ElectionDay stress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg — Sierra Club (@SierraClub) November 3, 2020    The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes. The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting. Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.  Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Graham, North Carolina The message on Election Night in Graham, where police pepper-sprayed protesters just three days before, was one of outrage and urgency – but also of hope and love. Led by Reverend Greg Drumwright, hundreds of people from across North Carolina marched quietly several blocks to two polling locations, before making their way to the central square, where a Confederate monument stands. “In the absence of hope, what do we have?” Drumwright told the crowd as they raised their fists in the air. “Therefore we cling to hope tonight,” he added. “I want you to cling to change tonight; I want you to believe that this is a shifting and a turning and a dawning of a new area; that things will not stay the same; that white supremacy will come down; that racism will come down; that love will be lifted up.” The marchers’ cheers drowned out the taunting by a small group of counterprotesters who gathered with confederate and Trump flags across the square. A judge in Nevada has ordered 30 Las Vegas-area voting sites to stay open for an extra hour tonight after a lawsuit was filed by Trump’s campaign and state Republicans. They had argued that 22 polling places did not open on time, and wanted the time extended. Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later. The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later.  Republican US Senator Ben Sasse has defeated Democrat Chris Janicek in Nebraska’s US Senate race. Republican US Senator Mike Rounds has defeated Democrat Daniel Ahlers in South Dakota’s US Senate race. Republican Cynthia Lummis has defeated Democrat Merav Ben-David in Wyoming’s US Senate race. The AP has called Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming for the Republican Party, giving Trump 21 more electoral votes. The AP has called New Mexico and New York for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 34 more electoral votes. It is 21:00 ET (02:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 4 Nov 2020 - 01:55 GMT Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Glendale, Arizona Early on Tuesday afternoon voters came in and out of Glendale Community College, not spending more than a few minutes inside the polling station. Glendale, 18km (11 miles) northwest of downtown Phoenix, sits in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county. Volunteers instructed voters where to go as they arrived at the community college’s student union. “Thank you for voting,” the volunteers said as voters left. Blake Spanko, 22, wore a “Keep America Great – Trump 2020” hat and said he also voted for Trump in 2016. “I voted for him in 2016 just because he’s a smart businessman,” he told Al Jazeera. “I figured if he can make billions of dollars he can run a country successfully – and I think he did that.” Describing himself as a “traditional Christian”, Spanko said abortion was another important issue that drove him to cast his vote for Trump again. “I think [Arizona] will stay red,” Spanko added when asked whether he believed the battleground state could give its 11 electoral votes to a Democratic nominee for the first time since 1996. Another voter Michael, who declined to share his surname, said he voted “against Trump” whom he feels has spread hatred. “I definitely am against hatred and I was raised to be kind,” he said. Speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone, Democratic legislator Cesar Chavez, who represents legislative district 29 in the Arizona House of Representatives, said his party was confident it would outperform Republicans on Tuesday. “I don’t think we’ve felt any better than we do,” he said. “Really, this is a work in progress for the last 50 years.” In the parking lot outside Glendale Community College, pro-Trump activists handed out fliers that said “Keep America Great – 2020” and signs reading “Latinos for Trump”. The AP called Indiana for the Republican Party, giving Trump 11 more electoral votes. Iranian American progressive Sima Ladjevardian has lost her congressional race with staunchly conservative House Republican Dan Crenshaw, according to The Associated Press news agency. Ladjevardian had garnered national attention while encapsulating the shifting demographics in the one-time Republican bastion of Texas. Crenshaw and Ladjevardian were competing to represent the state’s 2nd congressional district, which includes parts of Houston. Ladjevardian was born in Iran and immigrated to the United States as a child. She is running to represent Texas’s 2nd congressional district. Read more here. The AP calls Arkansas for the Republican Party, giving Trump six more electoral votes. Republican Senator Tom Cotton wins Arkansas’ Senate race, according to The Associated Press news agency. 4 Nov 2020 - 01:28 GMT Former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tells US broadcaster ABC News that several hundred people will be at the White House and that President Trump will address the nation “tonight” from the East Room. NEW: Kellyanne Conway tells @GStephanopoulos, ""You will hear from the president tonight…The president is expected to address the nation later from the East Room of the White House."" https://t.co/GwwRl4EUb3 #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/YGL8Ghx8Lz — ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2020  While several non-competitive states have been called already, winners have not been projected yet in any of the competitive battleground states whose polls have closed. Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are all too close to call, per the Associated Press news agency. Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states. In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county. In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016. The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections. Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover County  Trump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red. “Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me. “I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.” Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”. “The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.” Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, Wisconsin In rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope. Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said. “I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon. For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted. While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in. Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race. Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency. The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes. The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes. It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC. The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes. Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North Carolina 
Polls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.
Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state. “As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.” Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win. “We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said. A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening. The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaper An Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy. “If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.” Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT). All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) Here is why the state is so significant.   The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes. A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven. If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates. If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win. Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.   Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race. The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes. It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency. Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them. Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden. If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters. Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet. The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent. Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday. Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state. Find out when the polls close in each state here.  Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP. The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes. The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes. It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont. Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US. Watch our one-minute explainer on why. Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people. Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities. “He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera. But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community. “When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera. Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data. About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country. Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”. “Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day. Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours. WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2020  The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky. Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour. Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.   With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC. An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry. She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging. “I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office. “[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.” Read more here. The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency. US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting. “There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign. Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.” Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment. Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia. Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”. “I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades. Biden said this year is interesting. “You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night. “There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.” Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”. He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida. “The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.   Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, Florida Desirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered. “He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.” To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states. Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this. Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”  Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with. About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important. About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape. On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.  Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, Arizona
A slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left. Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.
“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls. “It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.” Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent. “The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.” Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. “It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added. His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016. “The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.
“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.” Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania DJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters. Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania. Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin. “It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.” Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].” Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.” 3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMT Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, Wisconsin The Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare. On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”. “It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process. Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting. “Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice. Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it. Instead of risking coming in here, they’re just doing it curbside. It’s safe for them and everybody else,” Smith said. 3 Nov 2020 - 21:31 GMT Wall Street’s main stock indexes rallied as investors hope a clear winner will emerge from an exceptionally divisive US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up more than 554 points or just more than 2 percent at 27,480.03 – it had been up more than 700 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 – a gauge for the health of US retirement and college savings accounts – closed up 1.78 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished the session up 1.85 percent. Tuesday’s strong finishes extended Monday’s gains. Though storefronts across the country have been boarded up in case violence erupts once the polls close, Wall Street is optimistic that a clear winner will be determined.

Speaking to only a few dozen supporters, mostly volunteers who have backed her husband’s campaign, she emphasised unity before the polls close later tonight. “There is nothing – nothing – we can’t do when we come together with courage and grit,” she told the crowd, who wore masks and stood several feet apart from each other. “Donald Trump is in this for himself. Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.” The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout. “This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.” Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad. Read more here. 3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMT Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina. Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot. “It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”. Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates. “I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said. “When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”. 3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMT Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, Wisconsin Election Day is off to the races in Wisconsin. Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history. Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart. A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd. Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.

,,Presidential Remarks on Voting Rights,"During a speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, President Biden said the United States is facing “the most significant … read more   Thank you. (Applause.) I see an awful lot of good friends out there. Please have a seat if you have one. I - let me begin by saying I used to be important. (Laughter.) I used to be the chairman of the board of this place. And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while. But thank you all for being here. I truly appreciate it. Governor, it's above and beyond the call. Mr. Mayor, I'd compli- - I thought you were a great mayor - still think you are - but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger. And - but - but all of you. And a good friend, Bobby Brady. I see so many friends out. Al Sharpton - Al, how are you, pal? It's great to see you. (Applause.) And I'm - I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to recognize my congresswoman from the state of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester - (applause) - and her sister who used to run my office. Stand up. (Applause.) Well, folks, good afternoon. There's a serious subject I'd like to talk about today. I'm here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center - the city and the place where the story of ""We the People"" - ""We the People"" began. It's a story that's neither simple nor straightforward. That's because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human. And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace. But some things in America should be simple and straightforward. Perhaps the most important of those things - the most fundamental of those things - is the right to vote. The right to vote freely. (Applause) The right to vote freely, the right - the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted. The democratic threshold is liberty. With it, anything is possible. Without it, nothing - nothing. And for our democracy and the work - and to deliver our work and [for] our people, it's up to all of us to protect that right. This is a test of our time and what I'm here to talk about today. Just think about the past election. A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton. A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her seventy-se- - 72nd consecutive election. You know what she said? She said this election was, quote, ""the most important vote that we ever had."" The daughter who voted in the memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn't have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through. Patients out there. And the parents - the parents who voted for school their children will learn in. Sons and daughters voted for the planet they're going to live on. Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference. America - America and Americans of every background voted. They voted for good jobs and higher wages. They voted for racial equity and justice. They voted to make healthcare a right, not a privilege. And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote - to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary. In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable. As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever - ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. (Applause.) All told, more than 150 [million] Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote. They voted early. They voted absentee. They voted in person. They voted by mail. They voted by drop box. And then they got their families and friends to go out and vote. Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure. They did so with unyielding courage and faith in our democracy. With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history. Challenge after challenge brought to local, state, and election officials; state legislatures; state and federal courts - even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice. More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments. In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges. Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times. It's clear. For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards. a big lie. (Applause.) The 2020 election - it's not hyperbole to suggest - the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this nation. This should be celebrated - the example of America at its best. But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst - something darker and more sinister. In America, if you lose, you accept the results. You follow the Constitution. You try again. You don't call facts ""fake"" and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you're unhappy. That's not statesmanship. (Applause.) That's not statesmanship; that's selfishness. That's not democracy; it's the denial of the right to vote. It suppresses. It subjugates. The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented. From denying enslaved people fu- - full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 100 years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the '50s and '60s; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just two weeks ago -- a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks - election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat - the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th. I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G7 and to NATO. They wonder - not a joke - they wonder, Gov - they ask me, ""Is it going to be okay?"" The citadel of democracy in the world, ""Is it o- - going to be okay?"" Time and again, we've weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections. And each time, we found a way to overcome. And that's what we must do today. Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work. And I've asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy. And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R.1, the For the People Act. (Applause.) That bill - that bill would help end voter suppression in the states, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering. Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the People Act. Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote. We must pass the For the People Act. It's a national imperative. We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand - (applause) - to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression. All the congresswomen and men here - there's a bunch of you - you knew John, many of you. Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, ""a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities."" The Court's decision, as harmful as is, does not limit the - Congress' ability to repair the damage done. That's the important point. It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength. As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it. (Applause.) That will be an important moment. And the world is wondering - the world is wondering - and Dwight knows what I'm talking about, for real. You know, the world is wondering, ""What is America going to do?"" But we also have to clear-eyed about the obstruction we face. Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool. And it's not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today. For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways. (Applause.) The focus - the focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia's vicious anti-voting law. The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that - at my request - is doubling its size in enforcement staff. (Applause) Civil rights groups - civil rights groups and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts. In Texas, for example, Republican-led state legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil impartial poll workers. They want voters to dive [drive] farther and be able to be in a position where they wonder who's watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote. To drive a hell of lot lo- - excuse me - a long way - (laughter) - to get to vote. They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don't vote at all. That's what this is about. This year alone, 17 states have enacted - not just proposed, but enacted - 28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention - and catch this - nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the state legislatures are trying to pass. The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real. It's unrelenting, and we're going to challenge it vigorously. While - (applause) - while this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it's taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms. It's no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote. It's about who gets to count the vote - who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all. It's about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties. To me, this is simple: This is election subversion. It's the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history. Never before have they decided who gets to count - count - what votes count. Some - some legi- - state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote. And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn't count for any reason they make up. They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses. And they're trying - not only targeting people of color, they're targeting voters of all races and backgrounds. It's with a simple target: who did not vote for them. That's the target. It's unconscionable. I mean, really, I - it's hard to - it's hard to declare just how critical this is. It's simply unconscionable. We've got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad - which I spent time with Putin talking about - but from home. From home. We must ask those who represent us at the federal, state, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people? Will you ignore their voices? Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy? That's what it's coming down to. Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to for- - forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party - the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives - and raise the urgency of this moment. Because as much as people know they're screwing around with the election process, I don't think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts - literally, not figuratively. You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President. State legislator comes along - under their proposal - and they say, ""No, we don't like those electors. We're going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman."" In 2020, democracy was put to a test - first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy. I've been around a long time in public life. I thought I've seen it all or most of it all. But I never thought I'd see that, for real. And in spite of what you see on television - and you saw it - you have senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol. Folks - but we met the test. Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials - many of them Republicans; our court system; and those brave Capitol police officers - because of them, democracy held. Look how close it came. I mean, for real, how close it came. We're going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion. We have to prepare now. No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. They will decide, and the power must always be with the people. That's why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022. We'll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out. We'll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level. We will be asking my Republican friends - in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties - to stand up, for God's sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote. (Applause.) Have you no shame? (Applause.) Whether it's stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together. Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there's real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life. The Founders understood this. The women of Seneca Falls understood this. The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement understood this. So must we. This isn't about Democrats and Republicans; it's literally about who we are as Americans. It's that basic. It's about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow. And quite frankly, the whole world is watching. Folks - (applause). I'm not being sentimental. I'm not preaching to you. I'm just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do - lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth]. There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today - an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are - who we are as Americans. For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country. It gives me no pleasure to say this. I never thought in my entire career I'd ever have to say it. But I swore an oath to you, to God - to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And that's an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic. (Applause.) The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally. I've said it before: We're are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War. That's not hyperbole. Since the Civil War. The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th. I'm not saying this to alarm you; I'm saying this because you should be alarmed. There's good news. It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be, for real. We have the means. We just need to show the will - the will to save and strengthen our democracy. We did it in 20- - we did it in the 2020. The battle for the soul of America - in that battle, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. Our Constitution held. We have to do it again. My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country. It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up. (Applause.) We will not give in. We will overcome. We will do it together. And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do. (Applause.) Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" ""Freedom is not a state; it is an act."" And we must act, and we will act. For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full. (Applause.) For ""We the People,"" for our democracy, for America itself, we must act. (Applause.) God bless you all. And may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy. (Applause.) But act. We've got to act. Thank you.

,,Polls say Trump is in danger. These shifting voters are the reason why,"These are some of the most powerful voters in the world. If the polls are to be believed, and we'll soon discover if they are, they're the people who would end Donald Trump's presidency. Meet America's shifting voters. They are a small slice of the electorate with colossal influence, not only on U.S. politics but on their country's relationship with the world. They tend to lack enthusiasm for either major party and fall into several categories — swing voters, centrists and moderates; first-time voters; people who vote for third parties; and people who sometimes don't vote at all. And they spell trouble for Trump. Surveys in advance of the Nov. 3 U.S. election find the president bleeding support from the kinds of voters who change their mind from one election to the next. Peg Bohnert is one of them.  The Arizona retiree describes herself as an independent who leans Republican. She voted for Trump in 2016, figuring she'd give him a chance, in the hope the federal government might run more efficiently under a businessman. It happened when the first White House press briefing of the Trump era was dedicated to arguing about the size of his inauguration crowd. The subsequent four years have only cemented her antipathy toward him. ""I trusted [Trump]. I no longer trust him, and I won't trust him again. Because he lies,"" Bohnert said.   ""No moral compass. No empathy. No kindness."" She said she's shy nowadays when she travels to even identify as an American: ""He's made us look like fools — as a country."" A major reason Trump won in 2016 was support from the so-called double-haters — people who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton. Che Eng is one of them. He reluctantly cast his ballot for Trump in 2016. ""I despised Hillary [Clinton],"" said the Arizona medical doctor. ""Trump was an outsider. I gave him a chance."" He's disdainful of both major parties, seeing them as irresponsible, with Democrats too far left and Republicans too far right. His breaking point with Trump came in late 2017. He worried about federal analysis showing a growing national debt because of a tax-cut bill Trump signed. While he's no big fan of Joe Biden, either, Eng voted for him a few days ago. ""It pains me,"" Eng said of voting Democrat.  He's so worried about his Republican friends finding out, he asked that his first name not be used in this story and that ""Che,"" a variation on his middle name, be used instead.  Arlene Macellaro was another voter uninspired by her options in 2016.  She's a longtime Republican and former health-care administrator living in Florida's massive Villages retirement community. She nearly cast a ballot for Clinton in 2016 — but got cold feet.  WATCH | Why this Republican is voting for Joe Biden:  Macellaro opted not to vote at all. She was scared off by the scandal over Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When the FBI announced two weeks before election day 2016 that it was reopening an investigation into Clinton, Macellaro decided to stay home rather than help elect a president who might immediately face criminal indictment. She's all in for Biden now.  ""Someone asked me yesterday, 'How does it make you feel when you think that your vote, if it's for Joe Biden, could change the complexion and feel of your Republican Party?'"" Macellaro said in an interview. ""My answer is, 'I feel good about it because I feel that it gives us hope to believe in the America that I grew up in.'"" The people quoted so far in this story share a few attributes common to the groups of voters turning most aggressively against Trump. All live in suburbs, they don't have the strongest partisan affiliation, two are women, and they are seniors or, in the case of 62-year-old Eng, close to retirement. Polls say the president is bleeding votes across those groups and others — including college-educated and non-college-educated white voters. Yasser Sanchez is a Latino, a Mormon and a lawyer in Arizona. Until recently, he was also a committed Republican — one who actively campaigned for past presidential nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney. ""I never saw a day where I would [support the Democrats],"" Sanchez said. ""[Then] Donald Trump happened. … Donald Trump happened to the Republican Party. … Not only will I be voting Joe Biden — I will be campaigning actively to get out the vote for Joe Biden."" Sanchez describes Trump as an autocrat-in-the-making, an existential threat to American democracy, and he calls this the most important election since the Civil War. WATCH | Why this Republican is campaigning for Joe Biden in Arizona: Meanwhile, young people keep entering the pool of eligible voters. And they favour Democrats by a huge margin. A big question mark is whether they'll turn out this year, given their lacklustre support for Biden in his party primaries. Some early indications suggest they are, indeed, voting in greater numbers than in 2016, when lower turnout among young and minority voters hurt Clinton in key swing states. Nineteen-year-old TeJean Neal just cast his first-ever presidential election ballot in swing-state Wisconsin. The Milwaukee university student dislikes both candidates: he derides Biden as a neoliberal, old-school, pro-business politician. But he's voted for him anyway, in order to oust a president he calls far more dangerous: he calls Trump a budding fascist, whose policies disproportionately hurt minority and marginalized people. ""It's not an enthusiastic vote. It's an I-have-privilege vote,"" said Neal, a student of film and African-diaspora studies at the University of Wisconsin.   ""There are more people who would be hurt by the fascist than the neoliberal."" He said he intends to protest a Biden administration from Day 1, on issues from police reform to transitioning from fossil fuels. But the immediate objective, he said, is beating Trump. Mateo Gomez has also just entered the eligible-voting pool. He arrived in the U.S. as a toddler from Colombia; he's now a 22-year-old MBA student in Florida.  Gomez said he agonized over his vote, his first chance to cast a ballot since obtaining U.S. citizenship.  Unlike Neal, he sees himself as a centrist. He has participated in town halls with politicians of both parties (including one with Biden) and sees himself as a bit of a peacemaker when his family and friends argue about politics. Gomez said he considered voting for Trump right up to the last minute – but wound up casting an early ballot for Biden.  The reason? He blamed Republican efforts to end the Obamacare health-insurance system, which his family relies on; he said he also wants better pay for teachers, and more action on climate change.  Gomez lives just north of Miami, one of the places in the U.S. most threatened by flooding and extreme weather. ""I try to see both sides. I try to avoid the drama,"" he said. Gomez notes, however, that many fellow Latinos will vote for Trump in this state — which is critical to the president's re-election. Trump has especially actively courted Cubans, and Venezuelans, who come from nations marked by left-wing authoritarianism. They're being bombarded with warnings that Democrats will usher in socialism, as well as some downright bizarre conspiracy theories. That speaks to a contrast in this election. While polls suggest Trump is losing support from most demographic segments, he's gained some ground with minority voters — performing as well as, or even better, than he did in 2016. He's still trailing significantly among those groups. But some surveys suggest he may be slightly reducing the Democrats' margin with Black men and Hispanic voters. Cuban-born Miriam Weiss said the enthusiasm for Trump is evident in caravans you see in Miami on weekends, consisting of thousands of cars, waving Trump flags. She's been supporting Republicans since John F. Kennedy's failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, months after she immigrated to the U.S. But she predicted more Cubans would support Republicans than usual — in the fear that socialism is taking over the Democratic Party, and that Biden won't stop it. ""If people vote for Biden we will be getting communism here within two years,"" Weiss said. Those attitudes aren't limited to Florida, or to Cuban-Americans.  A recent Pew survey estimated Trump's deficit with Hispanic voters is narrower in nine swing states than nationwide. Sylvia Menchaca is one such Trump supporter. She's a religious conservative, and entrepreneur who runs a Mexican restaurant in Arizona. She said she feels sorry for migrant children separated from their parents under Trump's border policy.  But she said the president has a responsibility to protect the border. In fact, she compared Trump to a biblical king — a flawed man, with a divine mission to protect his country. WATCH | Cuba-born Republican on why she's sticking with Donald Trump: And she thinks all those polls we're looking at will soon reveal themselves to be absolute junk. ""You think Biden's leading. You all think Biden's leading,"" Menchaca told a reporter in an interview.  ""It's so funny. ... But it's okay. [Trump's] going to win.""

,,LIVE UPDATES: Donald Trump speaking at Fox News Town Hall at Greenville Convention Center,"The two front-runners for the Republican ticket in the presidential race will be in Greenville on Tuesday. Check back to this live blog throughout the day for photos and updates from our reporters on former president Donald Trump and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley’s stops in the Upstate.   Haley’s event will be a noon bus stop at Clemson University at Greenville ONE, located at 1 N. Main St. Hours later, Trump will participate in a live recorded town hall at the Greenville Convention Center, located at 1 Exposition Drive, for an episode of The Ingraham Angle with Fox News’ Laura Ingraham. That episode will be broadcast at 7 p.m.   Trump’s visit to the Upstate begins with his landing at the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport one hour before the 2:45 p.m. town hall. Check back for live tweet updates on the former president’s arrival and his movements throughout the day. After the taping of the town hall with Ingraham, Trump will be attending a private fundraiser in Greenville that carries a $6,600 tag.   Haley will end her day in Clemson with a bus tour stop at the Madren Conference Center for a rally at 6 p.m. How to watch Donald Trump Town Hall:Here's how to watch Donald Trump's town hall event on television Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide In front of the Greenville Convention Center, a crowd of two dozen people protested former President Trump's arrival. While holding a Biden-Harris poster, Lee Turner, 69, was one of multiple people who spoke of their displeasure with Trump. Terry Benjamin ""Everybody's over Biden,"" said Brandon Edwards, 45, from Spartanburg as he waited for Trump to arrive at the Greenville Convention Center for his town hall with Fox News' Laura Ingraham. ""I don't care if you're a Democrat,"" he said. ""At this point, it's like, Trump is the only option and he's gonna battle against Biden. I'm looking forward."" Edwards was one of hundreds in a line that started queuing as early as 4:30 a.m. ""I don't know where the American people are politically as far as being excited anymore,"" he said. ""In the Obama years, people were excited about politics a lot and what could happen. The Trump frenzy in 2016 was wild, especially the Republicans. Over the past six years, a lot of people are emotionally dead. Everybody's looking for a restart."" Terry Benjamin The crowd in attendance at GSP airport cheered phrases like “U-S-A” and “President Trump” as his clearly marked jet, Trump Force One, landed shortly before 2 p.m. The former president went down the line signing items and greeting fans for about 15 minutes. Chalmers Rogland Voting in SC's Republican primary:Voting in SC's Republican primary Saturday? How to check registration, where to vote. Michael Close, 61, of Simpsonville, also attended the airport welcome which included close to 200 spectators. Close said he is retired after serving 26 years in the Air Force.“Curiosity more than anything,” Close said about his reason to attend today. “But I do want to show support for Trump.” Chalmers Rogland ""I'm concerned about the direction of our country and that specifically, right now, we're risking our credibility in the world. Our reputation has always been for fair elections, rule of law, support NATO. What Trump has done is all against that. It's all about him, it's not about us. He might say something to the contrary, but his actions in trials speak louder than words,"" Carl Prestipino said. Terry Benjamin ""I wish Michael was here today, and I wish our children and I could see him tonight,"" she said. ""But we can’t. He’s serving on the other side of the world, where conflict is the norm. Where terrorists hide among the innocent. Where Iran’s terrorist proxies are now attacking American troops."" Voters have told the Greenville News they like Haley because she supports the U.S. military. She even asked for a moment of silence after saying her husband Michael is at the ""forefront of her mind."" Savannah Moss Haley addressed the former and current presidents' ages: ""Even if Trump and Biden weren’t too old—and again, they are—Americans still oppose them because we know what they’ll do. They’ve already done tremendous damage—and they’re just getting started."" Haley on why she's running: ""I’m running for president to restore a country that’s strong and proud. That is why I will stay in the race after South Carolina votes."" Haley on why she's staying in the race: ""We have plenty of time to hash this out. If the race ended today, we’d have the longest general election in history. There are still eight-and-a-half months before Election Day. Do we really want to spend every day from now until November watching America’s two most disliked politicians duke it out?"" Some in the crowd answer: ""Hell no!"" Haley on President Joe Biden: ""First thing’s first: Joe Biden is doing more damage to himself than any Republican could ever do. Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds like his mind is closing up shop. The Democrats are getting weaker by holding a coronation for Biden. Republicans will get stronger through a vigorous competition."" Haley on President Biden: ""Like most Americans, I have a handful of serious concerns about the former president. But I have countless serious concerns about the current president."" Haley on former President Donald Trump: ""Now, I know what Donald Trump is saying. He wants an election with no opponent. But that’s not what voters are saying. Despite being a de facto incumbent, Donald Trump lost 49% of the vote in Iowa. In New Hampshire, Trump lost 46% of the vote. That’s not good. We’re talking about almost half our voters. What does it say about an incumbent who is losing nearly half his party? It spells disaster in November. We shouldn’t silence these voters like Trump wants. They have the right to keep speaking out."" Savannah Moss Trump's campaign announced endorsements at 12:20 p.m. of 15 South Carolina current and former law enforcement leaders including Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis, Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright and Anderson County Sheriff Chad McBride. Sheriff Wright was in attendance at GSP for the former president's arrival in Greenville.  “As the only law and order candidate running for president, President Trump has the unique experience and bold leadership to protect our families and communities. He secured our border once before, and he will do it once again,"" Wright said, according to a release from Trump's campaign.  The group gathered at 12:03 p.m. Tuesday outside the airport gate continued to grow. Law enforcement presence of airport security, state troopers and the sheriff’s deputies from both Greenville and Spartanburg counties was noticeable. Jennette, 47, and John, 63, Vassar, of Simpsonville held up a Trump sign while in line for the airport welcome of former President Donald Trump. John Vassar said that he learned about the airport welcome as a member of the GOP Elephant Club. Chalmers Rogland GREENVILLE, S.C. — A defiant Nikki Haley said Tuesday that she will not be leaving the GOP presidential race, in spite of a pressure campaign from former President Donald Trump and his allies. ""Well, I’m not afraid to say the hard truths out loud. I feel no need to kiss the ring. And I have no fear of Trump’s retribution. I’m not looking for anything from him,"" Haley said during a fiery speech. Her campaign had stirred speculation on Monday that Haley would leave the presidential race when it announced her plans to deliver a ""state of the race” address. But Haley took the opportunity to instead double down on her criticism of Trump. Click here to read. Francesca Chambers, Karissa Waddick, Savannah Moss Roughly one hundred individuals, many dressed in red, white and blue and Trump attire, were gathered outside of the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday, Feb. 20. Trump is expected to land in approximately two hours. Chalmers Rogland Nikki Haley’s staff sets up for a press conference in downtown Greenville. Haley is set to take the stage at noon. Her campaign is calling the event ""State of the Race."" Savannah Moss Donald Trump is poised to trounce Nikki Haley Saturday in her home state of South Carolina, an exclusive Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll finds, with a yawning advantage that hasn't been diminished by the former president's controversies or legal travails. Among those very likely to vote in the state's Feb. 24 Republican primary, Trump leads Haley by close to 2-1, 63%-35%. ""The story of this poll is the depth of strength shown by Trump,"" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. The former president holds double-digit advantages among men and women, in every age group, and among both high school graduates and those with a college degree. Click here to read. Susan Page/USA Today Haley made a campaign stop at the Canon Centre in Greer Monday night. ""SC hearts Nikki"" and ""Pick Nikki"" were some of the campaign signs visible in the crowd. Dee Culbertson of Simpsonville held a bouquet of balloons including some ""Over the Hill"" balloons and former president Trump as a baby balloons. On the campaign trail and in interviews, Haley has questioned whether Trump and President Biden are too old to hold office.

,,South Carolina Republican Primary: What To Know About This Week's Key Trump-Haley Faceoff,"Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump will compete Saturday in the fourth GOP primary contest of the 2024 election cycle—as Haley vows to continue her longshot candidacy despite a projected double-digit loss in her home state. US Republican Presidential hopeful and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks during a campaign ... [+] Trump leads Haley in South Carolina by 30 points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average, but Haley leads Trump by 21 points among liberals and moderates, according to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Tuesday of voters who had already cast their ballots or said they were “very likely” to vote in the primary. Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous counties in the state, could be ripe territory for Haley, as they’re the only two Trump lost in the 2016 primary. Only 4% of registered voters participated in South Carolina’s Democratic primary on Feb. 3, leaving open the possibility that a significant share of Democrats or independents could support Haley on Saturday in protest of Trump (voters in South Carolina can cross party lines to cast their ballots in either primary, but not both). PROMOTED But even if Haley, who served as the state’s governor from 2011-2017, outperforms expectations in South Carolina, her path to securing enough delegates to clinch the nomination is near-impossible as polls in subsequent primary states, including multiple Super Tuesday states on March 5, show Trump winning by wide margins. South Carolina will award 50 delegates, with 29 delegates going to the candidate who receives the majority of the statewide vote and three to the winners of each of the state’s seven congressional districts. Trump’s campaign predicts he will win all 50 delegates Saturday, according to a memo Tuesday estimating he could exceed the 1,215-delegate threshold to clinch the nomination after Hawaii, Washington, Mississippi and Georgia hold their primaries on March 12. Forbes Daily: Get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.    Results are expected shortly after polls close at 7 p.m. ET. The Associated Press called the race for President Joe Biden eight minutes after polls closed in the Democratic primary. Michigan will hold its GOP primary on Feb. 27. Polling in Michigan’s primary has been more sporadic, but surveys from last month and late last year showed Trump with a commanding lead. Newt Gingrich is the only South Carolina GOP primary winner since 1980 who hasn’t gone on to win the party’s nomination. 90%. That’s the share of likely South Carolina primary voters who have a favorable view of Trump and also plan to vote for him, compared to 65% with a positive opinion of Haley who said they’ll vote for her in the primary, according to the Suffolk/USA Today poll, showing Trump’s supporters are more loyal to him than they are Haley. Haley is the only remaining competitor to Trump, after biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race following the Iowa contest. Haley finished third in Iowa behind Trump and DeSantis on Jan. 15, lost to Trump by 11 points in New Hampshire on Jan. 23 and lost to “none of these candidates” in Nevada on Feb. 6. On Tuesday, she vowed to stay in the race at least until Super Tuesday on March 5, and has made plans to campaign in Michigan, Utah and Colorado after the South Carolina primary. Haley has said she’s doubling down on her candidacy, not to boost own political career, but because she wants to give Americans an alternative choice between two candidates—Biden and Trump—who voters consistently say they don’t want to see run again. In addition to Haley and Trump, several former candidates and less well-known figures will appear on the South Carolina GOP primary ballot, including DeSantis, Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas pastor Ryan Binkley and Florida businessman David Stuckenberg.   I cover national politics, with a focus on elections and the White House.

,,The 2020 Election by the Numbers,"                  It’s almost over. Yesterday Electoral College electors convened virtually or in person in state capitals across the country to cast their votes. The result was what everyone expected, the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States. With the election now essentially settled—Republican lawmakers may make one last doomed attempt to reverse the results when Congress meets on January 6 to confirm the Electoral College vote—here’s one last review of how the vote went. The Electoral College More on: Elections and Voting United States 2020 in Review Transition 2021 Joe Biden In 2016, seven electors declined to vote for the candidate they were pledged to. That was the highest number of “faithless electors” ever, with the exception of the election of 1872. That year sixty-three electors broke their pledge. They had a good reason to do so, however. They were pledged to Democratic candidate Horace Greeley—he of “Go West” fame. Greeley died three weeks after losing to Ulysses S. Grant and before the Electoral College met. His pledged electors were understandably reluctant to vote for a dead man. Three electors, however, did cast their votes for Greeley.  This year there were no faithless electors. So the final tally in the Electoral College was 306 to 232. That, of course, is the reverse of the margin Donald Trump won by in 2016. He called that a “massive landslide victory.” Biden flipped five states on his way to winning the Electoral College: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Every other state held to form. The Popular Vote Biden won 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the votes cast. He is the first U.S. presidential candidate to have won more than 80 million votes. Trump won 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. That’s more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won, with the exception of Biden. (Third-party candidates picked up 1.8 percent of the votes cast.) More than 159 million Americans voted in 2020: 159,633,396 to be exact. That’s the largest total voter turnout in U.S. history and the first time more than 140 million people voted. Voter turnout in 2020 was the highest in 120 years when measured as a percentage of the voting-eligible population: 66.7 percent. You have to go back all the way to 1900 to find a higher percentage turnout (73.7 percent). The election of 1876 holds the record for highest turnout: 82.6 percent. That, of course, was also one of America’s most controversial and consequential elections—and not in a good way.         Minnesota holds pride of place with the highest state voter turnout. Eighty percent of Minnesotans went to the polls. Oklahoma holds the dubious distinction of being the state with the lowest voter turnout. Just 55 percent of Oklahomans voted. A Close Election or Not?   So did Biden win comfortably? Yes, if you go by the popular vote. In the past six presidential elections, only Barack Obama in 2008 won by a larger total vote margin than the 7,060,140-vote margin that Biden piled up. Likewise, Biden’s 4.5 percentage point lead is the largest win in the past six elections other than Obama’s seven-point win in 2008. But as Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden, Grover Cleveland, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton can all attest, winning the popular vote doesn’t necessarily mean winning the presidency. When you look at the smallest popular vote shift needed to give Trump a victory, the 2020 election was close. Indeed, it was even closer than 2016. If Trump picked up the right mix of 42,921 votes in Arizona (10,457), Georgia (11,779), and Wisconsin (20,682), the Electoral College would have been tied at 269 all. The House would have then decided the election. Republicans will hold the majority of state delegations in the new Congress, and they undoubtedly would have chosen Trump. If Trump had also picked up the one electoral vote in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, which he lost to Biden by 22,091 votes, he would have won the Electoral College outright. Back in 2016, Clinton needed to pick up the right mix of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College. Women in Congress The 117th Congress will have a record total 141 women, or 26.4 percent of its membership, when it convenes on January 3. (Even so, women’s representation in Congress will lag behind that in the national legislatures of many other democratic countries.) Those numbers don’t include Senator Kamala Harris, who will be resigning her seat, or non-voting delegates in the House. These numbers could change slightly or remain the same, depending on whether Kelly Loeffler wins the January 5 run-off for her Georgia Senate seat and who is appointed to fill Vice-President-Elect Harris’s Senate seat. Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge is set to resign her seat so she can become secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Women won’t, however, be equally distributed between the two parties. Democrats will have 105 women members of Congress, which is one less than in the 116th Congress. Republicans will have thirty-six women lawmakers, or fourteen more than in the 116th Congress. That breaks the record the GOP set back in 2006. The House will have 117 women lawmakers, with eighty-nine Democrats and twenty-eight Republicans. Nine out of the thirteen House seats Republicans flipped from blue to red were won by women. Meanwhile, there will be twenty-four women senators, sixteen of whom are Democrats and eight of whom are Republicans. Again, how Loeffler fares on January 5 and who replaces Harris and Fudge could change these numbers. A record fifty-one women of color will serve in the 117th Congress. The previous record was forty-eight, set by the 116th Congress. Republicans broke their record for most women of color in Congress (five). The previous GOP record was three, set in 2014. Forty-six women of color will represent Democrats (not including Kamala Harris), down from the record forty-seven from the last Congress. Cori Bush (D-MO) became the first Black congresswoman elected in Missouri and Marilyn Strickland (D-WA) the first in the state of Washington. Strickland also joins Young Kim (R-CA) and Michelle Steel (R-CA) to become the first Korean American women in Congress. Wyoming elected its first female Senator: Republican Cynthia Lummis.   Other Notable Developments People of color will make up about 28 percent of the new House. Elected to the House this year, not including non-voting delegates, are forty-three Hispanic Americans (three more than the 116th Congress); sixteen Asian Americans (three more than the 116th); fifty-seven Black Americans (five more than the 116th); and five American Indians (two more than the 116th), and one native Hawaiian, Kaiali’i Kahele. Kahele is only the second native Hawaiian elected since Hawaii became a state in 1959. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) is the only Hispanic member of the Senate’s incoming freshman class. Once he is sworn in, the Senate will have five Latinx members, with the others being Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. The Senate will have two Black members after Harris resigns, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina. That number could go higher depending on whether Raphael Warnock wins his race in Georgia and on who is chosen to succeed Harris as California’s junior senator. The Senate will continue to have two senators of Asian descent, Democrats Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY) became the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress. The addition of Jones and Torres means that a record number of eleven LGBTQ+ lawmakers will be in the 117th Congress.   Morgan Cawthorn (R-NC) became the youngest person elected to the House in modern history. He is twenty-five years old. The pandemic helped popularize early voting and mail-in ballots. Americans cast 101,453,111 early votes. That is 64.1 percent of the total votes cast in 2020. The total number of mail-in ballots was 65,642,049. Looking Ahead The 2022 congressional midterm elections will be held on November 8, 2022. That is 693 days away. All 435 House seats and thirty-four Senate seats will be up for grabs. The 2024 election will be held on November 5, 2024. That’s 1,421 days away. Margaret Gach assisted in the preparation of this post.    ",www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers,
,,Can Joe Biden Intervene in a House Speaker Vote As President?,"As the chaos that has embroiled the House Republican Caucus entered its third day Thursday, President Joe Biden's White House has already made one thing clear: that the disfunction in the House was Republicans' mess to clean up, and theirs alone. ""We're certainly not going to insert ourselves in what's happening on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this week. ""He was a senator, he understands how this process works, and he's just not going to insert himself, he's going to let the process play out and continue to do the work of the American people,"" she added. Procedurally, there's nothing Biden can do, per the House rules. That framework dictates that the process of deciding who leads their conference is solely up to its members, who have so far failed to give any single candidate the plurality they need to become Speaker of the House in almost one-dozen consecutive votes. Entering the fourth day of votes for Speaker of the House Friday, some wondered if there was an imperative for him to act. The House of Representatives cannot consider or pass legislation until a speaker is seated, and, currently, there appears to be little indication the far-right House Freedom Caucus—which has so far refused to support leading Republican Kevin McCarthy's bid for the post—plans to yield any time soon. Truthfully, there's little incentive for Biden to do anything: the Republican Party comes into the 118th Congress with a majority, which top Republican Kevin McCarthy has pledged to wield to obstruct numerous facets of the Biden administration's agenda. He has also pledged to lead myriad investigations into a number of cabinet-level officials like FBI director Christopher Wray and Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, whom Republicans have targeted as the central figure in the Biden administration's perceived failures at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even conservatives admit that there is really no rush to seat a speaker of the house anytime soon. ""The stakes for the Speakership of the House are incredibly low at this point because all the leader of the House, basically, has to do is say 'no' to most of Joe Biden's proposals,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said on his daily podcast earlier this week.

""With regards to the fight over the Speaker...that's not my problem,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House for an appearance in Kentucky Wednesday afternoon. ""I just think it's a little embarrassing that it's taking so long,"" he added. Presidents in recent history rarely involved themselves in the process. Barack Obama—who had a reportedly rocky relationship with former Republican speaker Paul Ryan—remained on the sidelines of his contentious 2015 bid for the post amid the party's then-Republican majority. Looking back, however, there was at least one episode in early U.S. history where a president got intimately involved with the process. In 1834, then-president Andrew Jackson—a former Speaker of the House himself—sought to lobby friendly members of Congress to appoint future president James K. Polk for the post. However, when members of his ""Kitchen Cabinet""—a group of unofficial advisers he'd appointed in a break with his then-Vice President—went to Capitol Hill to lobby on Polk's behalf, many members of Congress, including some in Jackson's own party, perceived the effort as an encroachment upon the constitutional prerogative of the House, leading to a splintering of his party.
