,,Fake Biden Robo-Call Tells New Hampshire Voters To Stay Home,"Print As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robo-call is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home - using a fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden. ""It’s important that you save your vote for the November election….voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says. The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is investigating what he called an apparent ""unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters."" ""The Election Law Unit’s investigation is ongoing,"" he said. The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden's name on their ballots. Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was ""disinformation"" and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden's write-in campaign will be closely-watched amid weak polls for the 81-year-old president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party's nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden's name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire's historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden ""voice"" is heard using one of his signature phrases, ""What a bunch of malarkey."" The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair. Sullivan called the robo-call an attempt at election interference, and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated. In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday night. ""Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire primary,"" she said. She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number without her permission. The explosion of generative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - in recent months has spurred both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and even possibly overpower humans. The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was ""absolutely not"" involved in the robo-call. The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not involved. The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a reporter on Sunday night. ""Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing,"" the Phillips campaign said.

""It's important that you save your vote for the November election….voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says.

,,Fake Joe Biden robocall tells New Hampshire Democrats not to vote Tuesday,"        MANCHESTER, N.H. — The New Hampshire attorney general's office says it is investigating what appears to be an ""unlawful attempt"" at voter suppression after NBC News reported on a robocall impersonating President Joe Biden that told recipients not to vote in Tuesday's presidential primary. ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. ""These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely."" The investigation comes after a prominent New Hampshire Democrat, whose personal cellphone number showed up on the caller ID screens of those receiving the call, filed a complaint. “What a bunch of malarkey,” the robocall phone message begins, echoing a favorite term Biden has uttered before. The message says that “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election.” “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” it says. The message concludes with a phone number belonging to Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair who now runs a super PAC supporting the campaign to urge New Hampshire Democrats to write in Biden’s name in the primary.  If you received this robocall or have more information on it, contact NBC News here. Biden’s name does not appear on Tuesday’s ballot, a consequence of state elections officials' setting the date of the primary before South Carolina’s on Feb. 3, the first sanctioned contest of the 2024 nominating race under new Democratic National Committee rules. But local supporters launched the late write-in effort to both marshal support for Biden and send a message to the national party about New Hampshire’s coveted, centurylong tradition of holding the nation’s first primary. In an interview, Sullivan said she began receiving calls Sunday evening from those who had received the message. A woman she spoke to told her that Biden had called her, though she said she was not a Biden supporter. “I said, ‘You got a call from Joe Biden, and he gave you my number?’” Sullivan said she responded. A volunteer for the write-in effort also received the call and recorded it, Sullivan said, and shared it with organizers of the Biden write-in campaign. One of the organizers then shared it with NBC News. It’s not clear how many voters received the call or what types of voters were targeted. Lists of voters’ phone numbers can be readily purchased from data brokers. And Sullivan said that while it is not clear who is behind the robocall, “it’s obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden.” “I want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible, because this is an attack on democracy,” said Sullivan, an attorney, who said she believes the call could violate several laws. “I’m not going to let it go. I want to know who’s paying for it. Who knew about it? Who benefits?” She said she also plans to engage with federal law enforcement. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said that ""the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately."" Sullivan was party chair in 2002, when a so-called phone-jamming effort was carried out during a hotly contested U.S. Senate race. Two Republican officials, including the executive director of the state Republican Party and a Republican National Committee operative, were convicted of using computer-generated phone calls to disrupt Democrats’ get-out-the-vote call center operations.   State officials are speaking out against the calls. Secretary of State David Scanlan said the calls “reinforce a national concern about the effect of artificial intelligence on campaigns.” Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said she hopes the attempt to dampen turnout for Biden will backfire. ""I urge Granite Staters to make sure their friends and neighbors know the truth and turn out in even bigger numbers to write in President Biden’s name,"" she said. The campaign of Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who is challenging Biden for the nomination, said it was not aware of the calls but called them “wildly concerning.” “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” spokesperson Katie Dolan said. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.” A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign denied any connection to the calls, saying, “Not us. We have nothing to do with it.” Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior politics reporter for NBC News. Mike Memoli is an NBC News correspondent.

,,,"2020 ELECTIONS The ex-veep has work to do to win over Bernie’s base. Four in five of Bernie Sanders&#39; backers in Michigan said they&#39;d be dissatisfied with Joe Biden as the Democratic standard bearer. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo 03/13/2020 04:30 AM EDT  On Tuesday night, Joe Biden’s campaign was celebrating his latest primary night triumph. There’s no question it’s been a banner two weeks for Biden. But lurking in the background of his sudden ascension to all-but-presumptive nominee is evidence that at least some Bernie Sanders supporters might not migrate to him in November, weakening him in the general election. The significance of the problem became apparent in the same string of primaries that put Biden on the cusp of the nomination. In Michigan — a state critical to Democrats’ efforts to reclaim their general election footing in the Rust Belt — just 2 of 5 Sanders backers said they would vote Democratic in November, regardless of who became the nominee, according to exit polls. Four in five said they’d be dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic standard-bearer. Though it’s unclear how widespread or adamant the #NeverBiden contingent is — will they really stay home when the alternative is another four years of President Donald Trump? — the misgivings at least put the Biden campaign on notice that it has significant work to do to bring along Sanders’ base. There is certainly anecdotal evidence that for many progressives, Biden represents everything they dislike about mainstream Democratic politics. On “The Young Turks,” which draws millions of viewers, Krystal Ball, the former MSNBC host, said she couldn’t vote for Trump.       “But you can leave it blank,” she said, referring to the November ballot. Ball said she is an “undecided voter” because “if they always can say, ‘Look, you’ve got to vote for us no matter what, you’ve got no other choice,’ then they’re always going to treat us like this.” Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster who worked on the presidential campaigns of Jimmy Carter and Howard Dean, said that in their overtures to Sanders’ supporters, Democrats have “time, Trump and hopefully Bernie himself on our side.” However, he said, “It’s a huge challenge.” The November election is almost eight months away, and unlike in 2016, Sanders’ supporters don’t have the hard feelings of superdelegates — the party bigwigs who clinched the nomination for Hillary Clinton — to overcome. This year, Sanders’ momentum was blunted not by those insiders but by black voters in the South and, following his victory in South Carolina, by the broader electorate. Polls show Biden is also viewed more favorably now than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. “At the end of the day, it’s Biden or Trump,” said Boyd Brown, a former South Carolina lawmaker and former Democratic National Committee member. “They’ll turn out.” Still, some Sanders supporters see the consolidation of moderate presidential candidates and other elected officials around Biden as the establishment asserting its power over the grassroots. Trump has happily stoked the divide, declaring that the Democratic primary is “rigged” against Sanders, just as he did four years ago. “The rationale for us is that our votes need to be earned and that we’ve been taken for granted, and the party never moves to us,” said Alyson Metzger, a 54-year-old writer and progressive activist in New York City who supports Sanders. “If they install Joe Biden, I will not vote for Biden. … This is not democratic what’s happening in the Democratic primary.” For Metzger, not voting for Biden is a matter of conscience. For others, it is also strategy. On “Never Biden” Facebook pages and in Twitter threads, some activists argue that if Trump is reelected, Democrats will fare better in the next midterms and that the party will be more likely to nominate a progressive in 2024. If Biden is elected, they see eight years of centrist governance.  “I can’t vote for Joe Biden,” said Bryan Quinby, a left-wing podcaster in Ohio, saying that “it feels like the party doesn’t want us — the people who were pushing for Bernie Sanders and were enthusiastic about it.” Noting that his vote was “never guaranteed for the Democrats,” he said that in November, “I think it just means I don’t vote for president.” Of particular concern for Biden are young voters, including Latinos — the segments of the electorate that Sanders carried by a large margin. Evan Weber, national political director of the Sunrise Movement, a group of young climate change activists, said it is a “real possibility” that young liberals will stay home in November. While stressing that he would vote for any Democratic nominee, Weber argued, “There’s lots of narratives about why Hillary Clinton lost the election, but one undeniable one is that she did not mobilize the young people who turned out for Obama in 2012 and especially 2008. We hear a lot from pundits about Joe Biden being Obama’s vice president and him being able to recreate the Obama coalition, but one of the core and critical components of the coalition was young people.” Exit polls from this year’s primaries have found a stark age divide between Sanders and Biden supporters. In Michigan, almost two-thirds of voters under 45 backed Sanders, while Biden captured a third of them. It was even more lopsided among voters under 30: 4 in 5 voted for Sanders. But Sanders has failed to turn young people out at rates he’d hoped, and among those over 45, Biden won two-thirds and Sanders 1 in 4. Sanders, speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, reiterated that Trump “must be defeated” and that he “will do everything in my power to make that happen,” even as he vowed to press ahead in the nominating contest. But while acknowledging Biden’s expanding lead in the primary, he warned, “You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.” John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said Biden needs to make building a relationship with young voters “a central focus” of his campaign to beat Trump. Recent Democratic nominees who have lost, such as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, received about 55 percent of the youth vote, he said, whereas former President Barack Obama won 60 percent or more in his two races. “It’s not a coincidence that the youth vote crossed or met that 60 percent threshold in each of those campaigns that were successful,” he said. In the 2016 primary, Sanders dominated the youth vote against Clinton, winning more than 80 percent of voters under 30 in some states. When the general election came, some leading left-wing voices backed the Green Party’s Jill Stein. This cycle, Sanders has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he would support the nominee, regardless of who it is. The consequence of even a portion of Sanders’ support evaporating instead of migrating to Biden could be significant in a close election against Trump. And the urgency for Biden to win over a constituency that Sanders has carried reliably has become plain in recent days. Biden on Tuesday night thanked Sanders and his supporters directly “for their tireless passion,” saying, “We share a common goal. And together, we’ll defeat Donald Trump.” The next day, his communications director, Kate Bedingfield, was on Fox News arguing that “there is a lot more that unites us than divides us.” “There is a whole lot about our message,” she said, “that appeals to Sanders voters.”  ",www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/13/democrats-confront-a-never-biden-contingent-127438,© 2024 POLITICO LLC,
,,Biden tells voters 'you ain't black' if you're still deciding between him and Trump – video,"Joe Biden has been criticised after saying,'If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black'. The former vice-president made the comment in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show 'The Breakfast Club'. After a campaign aide said Biden had to wrap up the conversation, Charlamagne said: 'Listen, you’ve got to come see us when you come to New York, VP Biden. It’s a long way until November. We’ve got more questions.'  'You’ve got more questions?' Biden replied. 'Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.' He said Charlamagne and voters should 'take a look at my record, man!' Fri 22 May 2020 17.23 BST

,,"Opinion: Biden says if you’re black and don’t vote for him, you’re not black. He’s right","When the popular black radio host Charlamagne tha God told Joe Biden at the end of a spirited but friendly interview that he needed to come back on his show because “We got more questions,” Biden shot back: “You got more questions. If you have a problem figuring out if you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” Good one, Joe. As ridiculous as it was to say that to a black radio and TV personality who, among other things, wrote a book he calls a “self-help guide for the hood,” here’s the thing: Biden was right. He just didn’t have the right to say it. As a political and social liberal — who is also black — I was dismayed that anyone, black or white, voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But I was particularly appalled when I saw anyone black campaign for him. The only person I gave a pass to was Omarosa Manigault Newman — because she, at least, truly had a business reason to vote for the guy who had made her famous on “The Apprentice” and could possibly get something out of his becoming president. And she did — she landed some vague White House job that she eventually quit before writing an unflattering memoir of her brief stint there. I would be the last black person to suggest that black Americans are a monolithic group who all believe the same things. When it comes to electing the president of the United States, all Americans should care about voting rights, social programs, truthfulness and candor from our leaders, the environment, the meting out of justice, diversity in government offices, and the makeup of the Supreme Court. (As resilient as she is, Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot live forever.) But when voting rights are subverted, the safety net is attacked, environmental regulations abandoned and income inequality widened, the repercussions hit black people hardest. Charlamagne was right to remind Biden on his show, “The Breakfast Club,” that Democrats take black voters for granted. That’s true. The Democratic Party has a history of assuming: Who else will black people vote for? And the Republican Party often acts as if it lost black folks from the get-go. When Trump declared in 2016 at a political rally that black voters should choose him, asking them what did they have to lose, what had the Democratic Party done for them? I marveled, “Nice try.” But at the same time, it was preposterous. The New York Times documented a history of racial bias decades ago at rental properties owned by Trump and his father. Biden and the Democratic Party are a better choice than Trump and the Republican Party. It’s as simple and sometimes depressing as that. And not voting at all is dangerous. It only ups the possibility that Trump wins. Republicans vote, they don’t stay home. Even in a quarantine. Race and politics are so odd. President Clinton could possibly have gotten away with saying what Biden said because he was jokingly, affectionately, referred to as the first black president. Clinton seemed to genuinely bond with black folks — a result, I think, of his Southern roots and his effortless ability to bond with everyone, black, white, man, woman, child. And President Obama, precisely because he is black, could never have gotten away with saying what Biden said because suddenly he would look like a flaming militant. Biden’s willingness to speak outside the boundaries of political correctness is refreshing. When he yelled at a Detroit auto plant worker (and this was when he was still campaigning for the Michigan primary and needed votes) and refused to placate him on gun rights — “I’m not taking your gun away at all. You need 100 rounds?”— I thought, “Fantastic.” Finally, a candidate stands up to the gun-obsessed. But Biden went too far this time. And, within hours, he had apologized, saying he should not have been so cavalier. Charlamagne didn’t miss a beat when Biden said it. “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact I want something for my community,” he told Biden. Biden should go back on his show and respond to that.

,,"Biden plans to stay home, testing limits of virtual campaign","Bill Barrow, Associated Press Steve Peoples, Associated Press Joe Biden has no foreseeable plans to resume in-person campaigning amid a pandemic that is testing whether a national presidential election can be won by a candidate communicating almost entirely from home. The virtual campaign Biden is waging from Wilmington, Delaware, is a stark contrast with President Donald Trump, who is planning travel despite warnings from public health experts about the coronavirus’s spread. It also intensifies the spotlight on how Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, will manage his campaign, with some in his party fretting that his still-developing virtual model isn’t reaching enough voters. For now, Biden and his aides are brushing back hand-wringing from Democrats and mockery from Republicans who argue that the 77-year-old is “hiding in his basement.” “Voters don’t give a s*** about where he’s filming from,” campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon told The Associated Press. “What they care about is what he’s saying and how we connect with them.” Biden was more diplomatic in assessing the situation on Tuesday. “The idea that somehow we are being hurt by my keeping to the rules and following the instructions that (have) been put forward by doctors is absolutely bizarre,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” O’Malley Dillon took the helm of Biden’s campaign in mid-March, just as coronavirus shutdowns commenced. She recently beefed up the campaign’s digital and finance teams and said she’ll unveil battleground state leadership in coming weeks. She also pointed to budding “partnerships” that include the national party’s battleground state program. But those moves haven’t prevented critiques from prominent Democrats, including the architects of President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, who question Biden’s digital savvy and capacity to build the national vote-by-mail effort that might be necessary to win during a pandemic. Obama allies David Plouffe and David Axelrod wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Biden’s home studios resemble “an astronaut beaming back to earth from the International Space Station.” They encouraged Biden to make wider use of platforms from Facebook and Twitter to Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. In a similar piece, Lis Smith, media strategist behind Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 campaign, touted the virtues of local-market media and using celebrities more on other platforms. Yvette Simpson, who leads the progressive group Democracy for America, said she’s “very concerned” she cannot see “how we’re going to engage people.” She said the campaign has squandered time since Biden took command of the primary in early March. News Wrap: Biden blasts Trump’s handling of COVID-19 pandemic House Minority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a close Biden friend whose endorsement helped spur his run of primary victories, said he’s “very worried” about Democrats building a voter turnout operation that balances in-person voting with absentee balloting. Clyburn, however, emphasized that it’s not Biden’s place to worry over the details. “His job is to be the candidate,” Clyburn said. To some degree, the naysaying reflects Democrats’ desperation to beat Trump – who holds a clear early lead in fundraising and organizing – and the reality that Biden emerged from a haphazard primary campaign and must now play catch-up. Tara McGowan, founder and CEO of the Democrat-aligned digital firm ACRONYM, credited the campaign with making progress. “You can’t just snap your fingers and create an entirely different culture in their campaign,” she said. Clyburn argued there’s been a turnaround, especially in fundraising. “Winning is a great tonic,” he said. Biden raised $46.7 million in March, and in April he combined with the Democratic National Committee to raise $60.5 million. Trump and the Republican National Committee have far outraised Democrats this cycle, and they have more than $250 million cash on hand, but Biden’s April total nearly pulled even with Trump’s monthly total of $61.7 million. Erskine Bowles, one of Biden’s fundraisers and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, said the question isn’t whether Biden will catch Trump in total fundraising – he won’t – but whether he will have the resources to build a winning campaign. “People are giving to make sure he does,” Bowles said. From inside the campaign, the outside worries seem as much about timing and perception as about reality: The April and May fundraising windfall is just now being put into hiring. Biden has ramped up his social media presence, including a recent Instagram appearance with soccer star Megan Rapinoe and an economic speech on NowThis, a digital news medium targeting younger voters. O’Malley Dillon said she has “zero concern that we’re not at pace.” Critics, Biden allies say, also gloss over how Biden’s core pitch – touting his experience and empathy, making a moral and competence case against Trump, and promising to “rebuild the middle class” – won over Democratic primary voters even before the coronavirus upended daily life. Now, Biden’s argument against Trump is sharpened but stems from the same roots, with recent polling suggesting it’s reaching voters. “Joe’s got the right message,” Clyburn said. Indeed, days before his co-signed critique was published, Plouffe appeared at a Biden fundraiser that pulled in more than $1 million. On that call, Plouffe agreed with O’Malley Dillon that Trump’s turbulent presidency alongside Biden’s candidacy means “an expanded map” of battleground states. Trump is answering with a daunting reelection behemoth. On a call with reporters Tuesday, the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, called it the “largest field and data program” in GOP campaign history. And while O’Malley Dillon has spent two months building a general election campaign in a new digital environment, Brad Parscale has long been established in his role as Trump’s campaign manager. The Trump campaign hasn’t had to worry about money, with the president pulling in more than $700 million so far this cycle. “The Trump campaign never skipped a beat” when the emphasis shifted to digital, Lara Trump said. And now the president wants to return to a conventional travel schedule. He travels next on Thursday to Pennsylvania, and aides say he wants to travel at least once a week. Biden, meanwhile, is “anxious to go out and campaign” but is staying home “to set an example … with this health and economic crisis.” “This is not politics,” Biden said. “This is life.” Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Julie Pace and Will Weissert contributed from Washington.

,,"Biden: ‘If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black’","Joe Biden said he “shouldn’t have been such a wise guy” on Friday hours after he told a popular African American radio host that anyone struggling to decide whether to support him or President Donald Trump in the general election “ain’t black.” The presumptive Democratic nominee’s comment came at the end of an at times tense interview with Charlamagne tha God on “The Breakfast Club.” A staffer interjected that Biden needed to go, and Charlamagne shot back: “You can’t do that to black media!” “I do that to white media and black media because my wife has to go on at 6 o’clock,” Biden said, referring to his wife Jill Biden apparently needing to use the broadcast studio they’ve built in their basement in Delaware as the coronavirus pandemic has knocked Biden off the campaign trail. Glancing at his watch, Biden said, “uh oh, I’m in trouble.” Charlamagne told Biden that he should come to the studio in New York City for another interview, telling the former vice president that “we’ve got more questions.” “You’ve got more questions?” Biden replied. “Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” Charlamagne responded, “It don’t have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the fact, I want something for my community.” “Take a look at my record, man!” Biden shot back. Later on Friday afternoon, Biden addressed his comments in a call with the US Black Chamber of Commerce, saying, “I shouldn’t have been so cavalier” and insisting he doesn’t take black voters for granted. “The bottom line of all of this perhaps I was much too cavalier. I know that the comments have come off like I was taking the African American vote for granted but nothing could be further from the truth. I’ve never, ever done that and I’ve earned it every time I’ve run,” he said. “I was making the point that I never take the vote for granted and in fact I know in order to win the presidency, I need the African American vote,” Biden said. “I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy. I shouldn’t have been so cavalier.” Biden at times during the 2020 race has quickly become testy when challenged over his record by groups the former vice president believes would fare worse under Trump. In November, he told a protester criticizing former President Barack Obama’s record on deportations that “you should vote for Trump.” Visit CNN’s Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race The interview was Biden’s first appearance on “The Breakfast Club,” a popular nationally syndicated radio show broadcast from New York City that other leading Democratic presidential candidates appeared on during the primary. Charlamagne said during an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett on Friday night that the former vice president’s comments were “just a shock coming from an old white man like Joe Biden.” He called Biden “a very intricate part” of the legal system disenfranchising black Americans. He cited Biden’s role in legislation such as the 1994 crime bill, which expanded the federal death penalty and created dramatically harsher sentencing laws including “three strikes,” mandatory life terms for people with at least three federal violent crime or drug convictions. If Biden wants to be president, he needs to “really help the people that have helped Democrats, all of these years,” Charlamagne added. Biden’s win in the Democratic primary was fueled primarily by his support from African American voters, particularly older ones, who catapulted him to the win in South Carolina that set the stage for Biden to all but end the race in the following weeks. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found Biden with 81% support among black voters to Trump’s 3%. “Vice President Biden has spent his career fighting alongside and for the African American community. He won his party’s nomination by earning every vote and meeting people where they are and that’s exactly what he intends to do this November,” senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders said of the interview on Twitter. She added: “The comments made at the end of the Breakfast Club interview were in jest, but let’s be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump’s any day. Period.” Trump’s campaign used Biden’s comment to portray him as taking black voters for granted. Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement that Biden “believes black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking.” Trump in 2016 argued that black voters should reject Democrats who he argued had taken their votes for granted and back him, saying, “What the hell do you have to lose?” Biden has frequently criticized Trump’s history of racist comments and actions, which includes questioning former President Barack Obama’s citizenship, expressing frustration with immigrants from “s***hole countries” and referring to white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, and counter-protesters by saying there were “very fine people on both sides.” In the radio interview, Biden declined to name people on his list of those being considered for the vice presidential nomination, but said:”I guarantee you, there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.” Charlamagne pressed Biden on his role in enacting the 1994 crime bill as a US senator, which Biden defended, saying Hillary Clinton was “wrong” in 2016 to apologize for it and that Republicans had insisted on the inclusion of mandatory minimum sentencing. Biden also defended his calls to decriminalize marijuana, rather than legalize it. He said that before legalizing it, he wants to wait and see the results of studies on “what it affects, doesn’t affect in long-term development of the brain. And we should wait till the studies are done.” “I think we got decades of studies from actual weed smokers though,” Charlamagne cut in. “Yeah, I do,” Biden said. “I know a lot of weed smokers.” This story has been updated with additional comments from Biden and Charlamagne tha God Friday afternoon.

,,Voter groups warn Biden his stance on Gaza could suppress youth turnout next year,"        The leaders of progressive groups focused on mobilizing young voters are warning President Joe Biden that his handling of the war in Gaza could depress turnout in a demographic that’s already notoriously difficult to energize on Election Day. “We are experts in youth voting behavior who have worked tirelessly across the years to generate Generation Z and Millennial enthusiasm for civic action under a variety of circumstances,” the leaders wrote Tuesday in an open letter addressed to Biden and first shared with NBC News. “We write to you to issue a very stark and unmistakable warning: you and your Administration’s stance on Gaza risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year.” Signers include the heads of groups like March for Our Lives, the student-led gun violence prevention group founded by survivors of school shootings; United We Dream, which describes itself as the largest immigrant youth-led network in the U.S.; Gen Z for Change, which was started during the 2020 election by online influencers as TikTok for Biden; and the Sunrise Movement, the activist youth climate organization. “We mobilized the record youth turnout in 2020 that pushed your ticket over the finish line,” the letter continues. “There is no way for a Democratic presidential nominee to win without significant youth voter enthusiasm and mobilization. Young people are a cornerstone of a winning Democratic coalition, and the vast majority of young people in this country are rightfully horrified by the atrocities committed with our tax dollars, with your support, and our nation’s military backing.” The warning is the latest sign that the conflict in the Middle East risks fracturing a fragile Democratic coalition, one made up of large factions with opposing views about what level of support the Biden administration should be providing to Israel as it seeks retribution in Gaza for Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack. Muslim and Arab Americans, who overwhelmingly backed Biden in 2020, have threatened not to vote for him next year over what they say is a lack of U.S. action to help Palestinian civilians. A new survey of Michigan Democrats finds his support cratering among the group. Polls suggest that most Democrats and most Americans support Israel. But the same numbers also reveal a major generational divide, with young voters indicating they are far less supportive of Israel’s handling of the war than older and more conservative Americans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that three-quarters of respondents said supporting Israel is in the national interest. But only 52% of adults under age 35 agreed with that statement, and just 21% approved of Biden’s policy toward Israel. Young voters were already souring on Biden before the outbreak of the war, but the trend appears to have accelerated in the past month as pro-Palestinian protests erupt on college campuses. Gallup last week found that Biden’s approval rating among Democrats had tumbled by 11 percentage points in the past month, hitting the lowest point in his presidency, with a steep drop among young voters. A New York Times-Siena College poll of five swing states found that among voters under 30, who lean heavily Democratic, just 5% “strongly approve” of how Biden is doing his job and 25% “somewhat approve.” The generational split has also revealed itself inside the Biden administration, on Capitol Hill and at the Democratic National Committee, where staffers, who are typically younger than their bosses, have found ways to publicly express their concerns about Israel’s treatment of Palestinians despite a culture and even rules that prohibit personal political expression. In their letter, the youth-focused groups say they “fear that it will not be possible ... to recruit the volunteers, organizers, staff” needed and that they “cannot explain your position to the people of our generation.” Twenty- and thirty-something staffers are typically the core workforce of any political campaign. The groups urged Biden to pressure Israel for a cease-fire, adding that failing to do so would be “a moral and political disaster.” Of course, young activist groups, which are often to the left of Biden on most topics, frequently complain about his administration’s handling of a variety of other issues, such as student loans and climate change. And they have previously issued warnings, albeit less dire, about the potential political consequences of other decisions he has made. Ensuring turnout among young voters has traditionally been challenging even in the best of times — they typically vote at lower rates than older cohorts. But given their hard lean to the left, they are a critical component of any successful Democratic campaign, and their larger-than-expected turnout was partly credited with Democratic wins in 2020 and 2022. “We mobilized the record youth turnout in 2020 that pushed your ticket over the finish line in key swing states. Many of us worked to provide the critical source of support for Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections that prevented the Red Wave,” the leaders said in Tuesday's letter. “We did not spend hours upon hours knocking doors and making calls to turn out the vote so that you could support indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and violations of international law,” they added. “Your legacy hangs in the balance.” Alex Seitz-Wald is a senior politics reporter for NBC News.

,,Remarks by President Biden on Protecting the Right to Vote," Atlanta University Center Consortium
Atlanta, Georgia 4:14 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  In our lives and the lives of our nation — the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before from everything that followed.  They stop time.  They rip away the trivial from the essential.  And they force us to confront hard truths about ourselves, about our institutions, and about our democracy.

In the words of Scripture, they remind us to “hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate.”

Last week, [Vice] President Harris and I stood in the United States Capitol to observe one of those “before and after” moments in American history: January 6th insurrection on the citadel of our democracy.

Today, we come to Atlanta — the cradle of civil rights — to make clear what must come after that dreadful day when a dagger was literally held at the throat of American democracy.

We stand on the grounds that connect Clark Atlanta — Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and near Spelman College — the home of generations of advocates, activists, educators and preachers; young people, just like the students here, who have done so much to build a better America.  (Applause.)

We visited the sacred Ebenezer Baptist Church and paused to prayed at the crypt of Dr. and Mrs. King, and spent time with their family.  And here in the district — as was pointed out — represented and reflected the life of beloved friend, John Lewis.

In their lifetimes, time stopped when a bomb blew up the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and murdered four little girls.

They [Time] stopped when John and many others seeking justice were beaten and bloodied while crossing the bridge at Selma named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

They stopped — time stopped, and they forced the country to confront the hard truths and to act — to act to keep the promise of America alive: the promise that holds that we’re all created equal but, more importantly, deserve to be treated equally.  And from those moments of darkness and despair came light and hope.

Democrats, Republicans, and independents worked to pass the historic Civil Rights Act and the voting rights legislation.  And each successive generation continued that ongoing work.

But then the violent mob of January 6th, 2021, empowered and encouraged by a defeated former president, sought to win through violence what he had lost at the ballot box, to impose the will of the mob, to overturn a free and fair election, and, for the first time — the first time in American history, they — to stop the peaceful transfer of power.

They failed.  They failed.  (Applause.)  But democracy’s — but democracy’s visi- — victory was not certain, nor is democracy’s future.

That’s why we’re here today to stand against the forces in America that value power over principle, forces that attempted a coup — a coup against the legally expressed will of the American people — by sowing doubt, inventing charges of fraud, and seeking to steal the 2020 election from the people.

They want chaos to reign.  We want the people to rule.  (Applause.)

But let me be clear: This is not about me or Vice President Harris or our party; it’s about all of us.  It’s about the people.  It’s about America.

Hear me plainly: The battle for the soul of America is not over.  We must stand strong and stand together to make sure January 6th marks not the end of democracy but the beginning of a renaissance of our democracy.  (Applause.)

You know, for the right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty.  Without it, nothing is possible, but with it, anything is possible.

But while the denial of fair and free elections is un-democratic, it is not unprecedented.

Black Americans were denied full citizenship and voting rights until 1965.  Women were denied the right to vote until just 100 years ago.  The United States Supreme Court, in recent years, has weakened the Voting Rights Act.  And now the defeated former president and his supporters use the Big Lie about the 2020 election to fuel torrent and torment and anti-voting laws — new laws designed to suppress your vote, to subvert our elections.

Here in Georgia, for years, you’ve done the hard work of democracy: registering voters, educating voters, getting voters to the polls.  You’ve built a broad coalition of voters: Black, white, Latino, Asian American, urban, suburban, rural, working class, and middle class. 

And it’s worked: You’ve changed the state by bringing more people, legally, to the polls.  (Applause.)  That’s how you won the historic elections of Senator Raphael Warnock and Senator Jon Ossoff.  (Applause.) 

You did it — you did it the right way, the democratic way.

And what’s been the reaction of Republicans in Georgia?  Choose the wrong way, the undemocratic way.  To them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem.  So they’re putting up obstacles.

For example, voting by mail is a safe and convenient way to get more people to vote, so they’re making it harder for you to vote by mail. 

The same way, I might add, in the 2020 Election, President Trump voted from behind the desk in the White House — in Florida. 

Dropping your ballots off to secure drop boxes — it’s safe, it’s convenient, and you get more people to vote.  So they’re limiting the number of drop boxes and the hours you can use them. 

Taking away the options has a predictable effect: longer lines at the polls, lines that can last for hours.  You’ve seen it with your own eyes.  People get tired and they get hungry.

When the Bible teaches us to feed the hungry and give water to the thirsty, the new Georgia law actually makes it illegal — think of this — I mean, it’s 2020, and now ’22, going into that election — it makes it illegal to bring your neighbors, your fellow voters food or water while they wait in line to vote.  What in the hell — heck are we talking about?  (Laughter and applause.)

I mean, think about it.  (Applause.)  That’s not America.  That’s what it looks like when they suppress the right to vote. 

And here’s how they plan to subvert the election: The Georgia Republican Party, the state legislature has now given itself the power to make it easier for partisan actors — their cronies — to remove local election officials.  Think about that.  What happened in the last election?  The former president and allies pursued, threatened, and intimidated state and local election officials.

Election workers — ordinary citizens — were subject to death threats, menacing phone calls, people stalking them in their homes.

Remember what the defeated former president said to the highest-ranking election official — a Republican — in this state?  He said, quote, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.” 

Pray God.  (Laughter.)  He didn’t say that part.  (Laughter.)

He didn’t say, “Count the votes.”  He said, “find votes” that he needed to win.

He failed because of the courageous officials — Democrats, Republicans — who did their duty and upheld the law.  (Applause.)

But with this new law in Georgia, his loyal- — his loyalists will be placed in charge of state elections.  (Laughs.)  What is that going to mean?  Well, the chances for chaos and subversion are even greater as partisans seek the result they want — no matter what the voters have said, no matter what the count.  The votes of nearly 5 million Georgians will be up for grabs if that law holds.

It’s not just here in Georgia.  Last year alone, 19 states not proposed but enacted 34 laws attacking voting rights.  There were nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of state legislatures tried to pass.  And now, Republican legislators in several states have already announced plans to escalate the onslaught this year.

Their endgame?  To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion — something states can respect or ignore.

Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion.  It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote.  It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all.

It’s not hyperbole; this is a fact. 

Look, this matters to all of us.  The goal of the former president and his allies is to disenfranchise anyone who votes against them.  Simple as that.  The facts won’t matter; your vote won’t matter.  They’ll just decide what they want and then do it.

That’s the kind of power you see in totalitarian states, not in democracies.  We must be vigilant.

And the world is watching.  I know the majority of the world leaders — the good and the bad ones, adversaries and allies alike.  They’re watching American democracy and seeing whether we can meet this moment.  And that’s not hyperbole.

When I showed up at the G7 with seven other world leaders — there were a total of nine present — Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work — I said, “America is back.”  And the response was, “For how long?”  “For how long?”  As someone who’s worked in foreign policy my whole life, I never thought I would ever hear our allies say something like that.

Over the past year, we’ve directed federal agencies to promote access to voting, led by the Vice President.  We’ve appointed top civil rights advocates to help the U.S. Department of Justice, which has doubled its voting rights enforcement staff.

And today, we call on Congress to get done what history will judge: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)  Pass it now — (applause) — which would prevent voter suppression so that here in Georgia there’s full access to voting by mail, there are enough drop boxes during enough hours so that you can bring food and water as well to people waiting in line. 

The Freedom to Vote Act takes on election subversion to protect nonpartisan electors [election] officials, who are doing their job, from intimidation and interference.

It would get dark money out of politics, create fairer district maps and ending partisan gerrymandering.  (Applause.)

Look, it’s also time to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  (Applause.) 

I’ve been having these quiet conversations with the members of Congress for the last two months.  I’m tired of being quiet!  (Applause.)

Folks, it’ll restore the strength of the Voting Rights Act of ’65 — the one President Johnson signed after John Lewis was beaten, nearly killed on Bloody Sunday, only to have the Supreme Court weaken it multiple times over the past decade.

Restoring the Voting Rights Act would mean the Justice Department can stop discriminatory laws before they go into effect — before they go into effect.  (Applause.) 
The Vice President and I have supported voting rights bills since day one of this administration.  But each and every time, Senate Republicans have blocked the way.  Republicans oppose even debating the issue.  You hear me?

I’ve been around the Senate a long time.  I was Vice President for eight years.  I’ve never seen a circumstance where not one single Republican has a voice that’s ready to speak for justice now.

When I was a senator, including when I headed up the Judiciary Committee, I helped reauthorize the Voting [Rights] Act three times.  We held hearings.  We debated.  We voted.  I was able to extend the Voting Rights Act for 25 years.

In 2006, the Voting Rights Act passed 390 to 33 in
the House of Representatives and 98 to 0 in the Senate with votes from 16 current sitting Republicans in this United States Senate.  Sixteen of them voted to extend it.

The last year I was chairman, as some of my friends sitting down here will tell you, Strom Thurmond voted to extend the Voting Rights Act.  Strom Thurmond.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Wow.

THE PRESIDENT:   You can say that again: “Wow.”  You have no idea how damn ha- — how darn hard I worked on that one.  (Laughter and applause.)

But, folks, then it was signed into law, the last time, by President George W. Bush.

You know, when we got voting rights extended in the 1980s, as I’ve said, even Thurmond supported it.  Think about that.  The man who led the longest filibu- — one of the longest filibusters in history in the United States Senate in 1957 against the Voting Rights Act [Civil Rights Act].  The man who led and sided with the old Southern Bulls in the United States Senate to perpetuate segregation in this nation.  Even Strom Thurmond came to support voting rights.

But Republicans today can’t and won’t.  Not a single Republican has displayed the courage to stand up to a defeated president to protect America’s right to vote.  Not one.  Not one.

We have 50-50 in the United States Senate.  That means we have 51 presidents.  (Laughter.)  You all think I’m kidding.  (Laughter.)

I’ve been pretty good at working with senators my whole career.  But, man, when you got 51 presidents, it gets harder.  Any one can change the outcome.

Sadly, the United States Senate — designed to be the world’s greatest deliberative body — has been rendered a shell of its former self.  It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honored to serve in the Senate.

But as an institutionalist, I believe that the threat to our democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them, vote. 

Let the majority prevail.  (Applause.)  And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.  (Applause.)

You know, last year, if I’m not mistaken, the filibuster was used 154 times.  The filibuster has been used to generate compromise in the past and promote some bipartisanship.  But it’s also been used to obstruct — including and especially obstruct civil rights and voting rights.

And when it was used, senators traditionally used to have to stand and speak at their desks for however long it took, and sometimes it took hours.  And when they sat down, if no one immediately stood up, anyone could call for a vote or the debate ended.

But that doesn’t happen today.  Senators no longer even have to speak one word.  The filibuster is not used by Republicans to bring the Senate together but to pull it further apart.

The filibuster has been weaponized and abused.

While the state legislatures’ assault on voting rights is simple — all you need in your House and Senate is a pure majority — in the United States Senate, it takes a supermajority: 60 votes, even to get a vote — instead of 50 — to protect the right to vote.

State legislatures can pass anti-voting laws with simple majorities.  If they can do that, then the United States Senate should be able to protect voting rights by a simple majority.  (Applause.)

Today I’m making it clear: To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed — (applause) — to prevent a minority of senators from blocking action on voting rights.  (Applause.)  

When it comes to protecting majority rule in America, the majority should rule in the United States Senate.  

I make this announcement with careful deliberation, recognizing the fundamental right to vote is the right from which all other rights flow.

And I make it with an appeal to my Republican colleagues, to those Republicans who believe in the rule of law: Restore the bipartisan tradition of voting rights. 

The people who restored it, who abided by it in the past were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush.  They all supported the Voting Rights Act.

Don’t let the Republican Party morph into something else.  Restore the institution of the Senate the way it was designed to be.

Senate rules were just changed to raise the debt ceiling so we wouldn’t renege on our debt for the first time in our history and prevent an economic crisis.  That was done by a simple majority.

As Senator Warnock said a few weeks ago in a powerful speech: If we change the rules to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, we should be able to change the rules to protect the heart and soul of our democracy.  (Applause.)  He was right.

In the days that followed John Lewis’s death, there was an outpouring of praise and support across the political spectrum.

But as we stand here today, it isn’t enough just to praise his memory.  We must translate eulogy into action.  We need to follow John Lewis’s footsteps.  We need to support the bill in his name.

Just a few days ago, we talked about — up in the Congress and in the White House — the event coming up shortly to celebrate Dr. King’s birthday.  And Americans of all stripes will praise him for the content of his character.

But as Dr. King’s family said before, it’s not enough to praise their father.  They even said: On this holiday, don’t celebrate his birthday unless you’re willing to support what he lived for and what he died for.  (Applause.)

The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation’s history.

We will choose — the issue is: Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadows, justice over injustice? 

I know where I stand.  I will not yield.  I will not flinch.  I will defend the right to vote, our democracy against all enemies — foreign and, yes, domestic.  (Applause.)

And the question is: Where will the institution of the United States Senate stand?  Every senator — Democrat, Republican, and independent — will have to declare where they stand, not just for the moment, but for the ages.

Will you stand against voter suppression?  Yes or no?  That’s the question they’ll answer.  Will you stand against election subversion?  Yes or no?  Will you stand for democracy?  Yes or no?

And here’s one thing every senator and every American should remember: History has never been kind to those who have sided with voter suppression over voters’ rights.  And it will be even less kind for those who side with election subversion.

So, I ask every elected official in America: How do you want to be remembered? 

At consequential moments in history, they present a choice: Do you want to be the si- — on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?  Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor?  Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?

This is the moment to decide to defend our elections, to defend our democracy.  (Applause.)

And if you do that, you will not be alone.  That’s because the struggle to protect voting rights has never been borne by one group alone.

We saw Freedom Riders of every race.  Leaders of every faith marching arm in arm.  And, yes, Democrats and Republicans in Congress of the United States and in the presidency.

I did not live the struggle of Douglass, Tubman, King, Lewis, Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, and countless others — known and unknown.

I did not walk in the shoes of generations of students who walked these grounds.  But I walked other grounds.  Because I’m so damn old, I was there as well.  (Laughter.)

You think I’m kidding, man.  (Laughter.)  It seems like yesterday the first time I got arrested.  Anyway — (laughter).

But their struggles here — they were the ones that opened my eyes as a high school student in the late — in the late ’50s and early ’60s.  They got me more engaged in the work of my life.

And what we’re talking about today is rooted in the very idea of America — the idea that Annell Ponder, who graduated
from Clark Atlanta, captured in a single word.  She was a teacher and librarian who was also an unyielding champion of voting rights.

In 1963 — when I was just starting college at university — after registering voters in Mississippi, she was pulled off a bus, arrested, and jailed, where she was brutally beaten.

In her cell, next to her, was Fannie Lou Hamer, who described the beating this way, and I quote: “I could hear the sounds of [the] licks and [the] horrible screams…They beat her, I don’t know [for] how long.  And after a while, she began to pray, and asked God to have mercy on those people.”

Annell Ponder’s friends visited her the next day.  Her face was badly swollen.  She could hardly talk.

But she managed to whi- — whisper one word: “Freedom.”  “Freedom” — the only word she whispered.

After nearly 250 years since our founding, that singular idea still echoes.  But it’s up to all of us to make sure it never fades, especially the students here — your generation that just started voting — as there are those who are trying to take away that vi- — vote you just started to be able to exercise. 

But the giants we honor today were your age when they made clear who we must be as a nation.  Not a joke.  Think about it.  In the early ’60s, they were sitting where you’re sitting.  They were you.  And like them, you give me much hope for the future.

Before and after in our lives — and in the life of the nation — democracy is who we are, who we must be — now and forever.  So, let’s stand in this breach together.  Let’s love good, establish justice in the gate. 

And remember, as I said, there is one — this is one of those defining moments in American history: Each of those who vote will be remembered by class after class, in the ’50s and ’60s — the 2050s and ’60s.  Each one of the members of the Senate is going to be judged by history on where they stood before the vote and where they stood after the vote. 

There’s no escape.  So, let’s get back to work. 

As my fath- — my grandfather Finnegan used to say every time I walked out the door in Scranton, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.”  Then he’d say, “No, Joey, spread it.” 

Let’s spread the faith and get this done.  (Applause.) 

May God bless you all.  And may God protect the sacred right to vote.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  I mean it.  Let’s go get this done.  Thank you.  (Applause.)

,,"Biden loses ground with young voters, prompting Dem concerns","   Democrats are raising concerns that President Biden’s standing among young voters is in jeopardy after polling released this week showed Biden effectively tied with former President Trump among young voters.  A New York Times/Siena College survey released Monday showed Biden virtually tied with Trump among voters younger than 30, with 30 percent backing Biden and 29 percent backing Trump. Thirty-four percent said they backed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Meanwhile, an Emerson College poll released last month found 45 percent of voters younger than 30 backing Trump, while 43 percent said they supported Biden. The latest data is surprising, given Biden’s victory over Trump among young voters in 2020. According to AP VoteCast, Biden won 61 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29. “Young people as we know have always been fiercely independent,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. “It’s a more cynical electorate with God knows how many more independent candidacies, which on the youth cohort are more likely to hurt Biden more than Trump.”   The polling comes as Biden has faced backlash among young voters and activists for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.   Earlier this week, several progressive groups, including March for Our Lives, GenZ For Change, and the Sunrise Movement, penned an open letter to Biden, warning his handling of the Israel-Hamas War could depress turnout among Millennial and Generation Z voters come next year.   “We write to you to issue a very stark and unmistakable warning: you and your Administration’s stance on Gaza risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year,” the letter read.   Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reiterated the same sentiment in an interview on CNN.   “The primary concern for everybody is the status of Palestinians and the human rights, as well as Israelis too, the safety in the region,” Ocasio-Cortez told the network. “So I try not to look at this through an electoral lens but through what the right thing to do is. But I think it’s certainly something that is, that should be top of mind when it comes to the Democratic coalition.”  When asked about the latest polling showing Biden seemingly in a slump with young voters, however, Democrats point to what they see as the pivotal role young voters played in Tuesday’s off-year elections.   “If you want to see how people are going to vote, look at how they are voting,” said Jack Lobel, spokesperson for the Gen Z group Voters of Tomorrow. “On Tuesday, we saw young voters turn out in Virginia and in Ohio and in Kentucky and vote for President Biden’s ideology.”   Democrats also say polls and predictions have missed the mark on young voter turnout in the past.   “The polls for the last several years on young voters have missed the mark every single time. We just had an election, and we were told right before the election that young people were probably not going to vote as overwhelmingly Democratic or turn out at the rates they did,” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the youth voting organization NextGen America.   “We’re not riding the pollercoaster,” she continued. “We’re doing the hard organizing work to make sure that young voters turnout and young voters are overwhelmingly progressive.”   “I don’t think this poll is reflective of the political reality that has played out every single election post-2016,” she added.  Ramirez pointed to top motivators for young Democratic-leaning voters, including climate change, student debt relief and a Trump candidacy.   “In 2020, Joe Biden was not the youth vote candidate, it’s true,” she said. “But what we saw is that young people did turn out and vote for him overwhelmingly, and they did it also in repudiation of Donald Trump and also for progressive policy.”  And Democrats are quick to note the recent poll numbers are not about Trump gaining ground with young voters, but rather Biden losing ground.  “I think it’s that Biden has taken a big hit with younger voters and is just not top of mind and I think that there is a restlessness that’s sort of playing. But I do not think that this is a move toward Trump by young voters by any stretch of the imagination,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist.   Reinish predicted young voters will ultimately choose Biden over Trump again, assuming Trump gets the nomination, pointing to their stances on climate change, abortion and democracy.   Della Volpe said it was critical for the Biden administration and campaign to continue to communicate their stances and accomplishments on these issues in an effort to win young voters over.   “It’s going to be important for members of the Biden-Harris team to constantly communicate the positive change in the country based upon youth participation,” he said, citing issues like climate investments, diversity in government and bipartisan gun legislation.   Still, Biden has faced questions over his age and whether that will ultimately be a factor in voter enthusiasm for his campaign.   An AP-NORC poll released in August found that 77 percent of voters younger than 45 said they thought Biden was too old to serve as president effectively. Among Democrats aged 18 to 29 years old, 76 percent said they believed Biden was too old to run for president.   However, Democratic activists argued it is Biden’s ideology rather than age that will be the biggest factor.  “President Biden being 80 years old does not matter to me how I live my life,” said Lobel, who is 19 and voting in his first presidential election next year. “Him investing in my education, in my future as a person who’s going to inherit this world, this economy, this climate, this matters to me.”   “As a 19-year-old, these are the numbers I care about, not his age,” he said.

,,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?," Some Pennsylvania voters say President Biden’s warning that Donald Trump threatens U.S. democracy is not reaching beyond Democratic voters. Some Democratic voters say Trump is a threat and hold him responsible for the events of January 6, 2021. (Feb 17) (AP Video: Mike Rubinkam) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there.  “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. Evelyn Fermin speaks during an interview, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” Curt Balch poses for a photo in Hellertown, Penn. on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Christian Miller speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. Anna Kodama speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews Pennsylvania voters again suggest it’s not resonating. Kodak said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem Chapter of the NAACP, talks about the presidential election in Bethlehem, Penn., Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. Guillermo Lopez Jr. speaks during an interview Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,Biden’s Young Voter Problem Just Got Even Worse,"Young voters are proving decidedly less interested in a 2024 Biden win than they were four years ago. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Tuesday indicates that most young voters are leaning toward voting for Donald Trump, with the indicted former president pulling 49 percent of the vote from constituents aged 18 to 29, with Biden at just 43 percent. That’s a stark contrast from July, when young voters preferred Biden by as much as 10 percentage points. The difference is likely due to the president’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, in which Biden has been a staunch ally to Israel. That’s resulted in a 72 percent disapproval rating within the same age bracket, according to the poll. However, faced with Trump on the other side of the ballot, those voters say they may be more likely to stay home than turn up to the voting booths. “I don’t want to vote for someone who is not aligned with my own personal values, as Biden has shown he is not when it comes to Gaza,” Colin Lohner, a 27-year-old software engineer in San Francisco, told The New York Times. “Do I vote for Biden or do I not vote at all? That’s really difficult, because if I don’t vote for Biden, I open up the possibility that Trump will win, and I really do not want that.” So far, the conflict has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians and displaced 1.9 million people living in the Gaza Strip—roughly 90 percent of its population—since the war began on October 7. The dwindling poll numbers are an alarming difference for the beleaguered president, who needed the support of young and minority voters to clinch his 2020 bid for the White House. Biden has voiced his own concern, reportedly marking his favorability ratings as a known issue in a closed-door White House meeting with top aides the day before Thanksgiving. At the time, Biden was neck and neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. And yet, the president is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president in a national survey, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote against Trump’s 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to prevent an expert witness from testifying in his upcoming defamation trial against writer E. Jean Carroll. In a fun twist, the expert witness is the same woman who helped set massive damages for Rudy Giuliani. A federal judge ruled in September that Trump is liable for defaming Carroll in 2019 and owes her monetary damages. The exact amount will be set during the trial, which will begin in January. Trump’s lawyers filed a motion on Wednesday asking presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan to bar Ashlee Humphreys, a Northwestern University marketing professor who analyzes social media trends, from testifying against the former president next month. In the court documents, lawyer Michael Madaio argued that the damages estimates Humphreys had previously submitted were too high. “The damages estimations in her initial report are egregiously inflated (to the tune of millions of dollars), utilize methods which ascribe harm in an unreliable and incorrect manner; and do not accurately reflect the actual harm to plaintiff’s reputation,” Madaio wrote. Madaio took particular issue with the fact that Humphreys had initially included estimates for alleged damage caused by three different comments Trump made. Carroll is no longer suing over one of those statements, but Madaio argued Humphreys had not adjusted her estimate accordingly. Carroll’s lawyer hit back Monday, pointing out that Humphreys had indeed accounted for the change in estimated damages in a supplemental report. “Trump is understandably desperate to get rid of Professor Humphreys,” Roberta Kaplan (no relation to the judge) wrote in a filing asking to reject Trump’s request. “That Professor Humphreys recently testified in another case that resulted in a $108 million defamation verdict likely adds to Trump’s sense of urgency.” Kaplan was referring to the defamation case against Giuliani. The former Trump lawyer was found liable in August for defaming Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. On Friday, Giuliani was ordered to pay the women a whopping $148 million in damages. Humphreys testified against Giuliani on December 13, the same day Trump’s lawyers filed the motion to bar her from appearing at the Carroll trial. Her testimony was pivotal in determining the exact amount of damages he owed. Humphreys is no stranger to Carroll’s case against Trump. The Northwestern professor already testified in Carroll’s first defamation lawsuit against the former president. In May, a jury unanimously found Trump liable for sexual abuse and battery against Carroll in the mid-1990s and for defaming her in 2022 while denying the assault. He was ordered to pay her $5 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s estimates. Carroll’s second lawsuit is for comments Trump made in 2019, when he said she made up the rape allegation to promote her memoir. Judge Kaplan ruled that since Trump has already been found liable for sexual abuse, his 2019 comments are by default defamatory. Carroll is now seeking up to $12 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s recommendation. Clearly $148 million in legal penalties isn’t punishment enough for Rudy Giuliani, who took to Newsmax’s airwaves on Monday to vent even more defamatory lies about Georgia poll workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. “Your initial allegations, do you still believe them to be true?” asked host Rob Schmitt. “Yeah. Well, of course they’ll sue me again when I say that, but yeah, I do,” Giuliani said. “But they want me to lie. They, basically, they are suing me in order to lie to them.” “If I showed you the evidence right now, and I think you’ve played it on your air, people would see that what I said was absolutely true,” he said. Unfortunately for the former federal prosecutor, claiming that people made him lie may not be the concrete defense he hopes it to be. Before last week’s judgment, Giuliani repeated election lies that he had previously admitted were untrue mere steps outside the courthouse, resulting in a wrist slap by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who warned that it could result in more defamation charges for the broke fixer. And despite repeated promises to provide evidence on his debunked allegations, when the time came to finally take the stand and make “definitively clear” that what he said about the pair of workers was true, Giuliani opted not to. Freeman and Moss originally sought $24 million each in damages after the former New York City mayor accused them of manipulating ballots—claims that transformed into months of harassment, death threats, and protesters at their doorsteps. Instead, the jury decided they deserve far more. On Friday, a court ruled that the mother-daughter duo would receive $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages from the former Trump attorney. On Monday, the pair hit Giuliani with another lawsuit seeking a gag order and to permanently bar America’s disgraced mayor from continuing to trash-talk them. That new suit is based entirely on baseless claims that Giuliani made over the weekend, including some statements allowed to air on Newsmax, according to the legal complaint. “Are they actually going to put a gag on me while I walk around?” Giuliani joked on air. If there’s one thing you can count on Republicans for, it’s to tepidly push back on Donald Trump’s most vile comments. Trump drilled down harder than ever on fascist language during two weekend speeches. On Saturday, he said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” The next day, he promised to use federal law enforcement funds to combat a “military invasion” at the southern border. But when asked about his comments late Monday, Republican senators had only the mildest of rebukes. “I obviously don’t agree with that. I mean, we’re all children of immigrants,” Senator Shelley Moore Caputo told Politico, somehow managing to “All Lives Matter” immigration. Senator Roger Wicker said he “certainly wouldn’t have said that,” and Senator Thom Tillis called Trump’s words “unhelpful.” Senators John Kennedy and Todd Young declined to comment, although Young joked he was “looking forward to another year of answering these questions.” “Drugs, criminals, gang members, and terrorists are pouring into our country at record levels. We’ve never seen anything like it. They’re taking over our cities,” Trump said over the weekend. He then promised to “shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.” No GOP senators have called for Trump to apologize. Their lukewarm stance should come as no surprise, though. This is a familiar tune for Republican lawmakers. Throughout Trump’s presidency, Republicans regularly evaded questions about his inflammatory rhetoric. Lawmakers would say they hadn’t seen the former president’s posts on social media or during speeches. Sometimes they would say they disagreed with his stance; other times they would quietly adopt his position. In fact, Republicans were perfectly happy to let Trump’s words slide so long as he continued to give them what they wanted in terms of policy and judicial appointments. This has continued since Trump left office, for instance last November, when Trump met with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and antisemite Kanye West. No members of Republican leadership ever explicitly condemned the meeting. Some lawmakers even tried to claim that Trump didn’t know who he was meeting or that he had condemned Fuentes’s previous comments. The Georgia election workers that Rudy Giuliani defamed sued the former Trump attorney again on Monday for continuing to make defamatory statements about them. Giuliani was found liable in August for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, after he accused the pair of manipulating ballots in Georgia during the 2020 election. The two women have been subjected to months of harassment and death threats. A judge ordered Giuliani on Friday to pay Freeman and Moss nearly $150 million in damages last week. Freeman and Moss filed a fresh defamation lawsuit against Giuliani Monday for refusing to take a hint. “Defendant Giuliani continues to spread the very same lies for which he has already been held liable in the Freeman I action,” the lawsuit said, referring to the previous case. In fact, on December 15, “just hours after the jury in Freeman I returned a $148 million verdict against him, Defendant Giuliani appeared from Washington, D.C. for a live interview on Newsmax, in which he repeatedly asserted, either directly or at minimum by implication, that he was in possession of video evidence demonstrating the truth of his allegations against Plaintiffs.” Giuliani has already admitted that he made false statements about Freeman and Moss. In a July court filing, he acknowledged that his “statements carry meaning that is defamatory.” At the time, he insisted he only made that concession to move the lawsuit forward. Except he moved it forward right to a ruling of liability. And on Friday, a jury decided he owed the mother and daughter $148 million: $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages. Monday’s lawsuit is only seeking to bar Giuliani from making or repeating any more false claims about Freeman and Moss. The women have also requested he pay their legal fees for the new suit, but they are not asking for further financial damages. That could be because Giuliani is so hard up for cash that he will likely struggle to make the payments from Friday’s ruling. Giuliani has begun representing himself in court to save some cash. The man once affectionately known as “America’s mayor” is scrambling to find the money for all his legal fees and even listed his Manhattan apartment for sale in July. In August, after he was indicted in Georgia, Giuliani asked his social media followers to donate to his defense fund. He also flew to Mar-a-Lago to beg his boss Donald Trump to pay him for working as Trump’s personal attorney. That didn’t work, but Trump did agree to host a fundraiser dinner for Giuliani. Entry cost: $100,000 a plate. What’s more, people keep suing him for money owed. Several of Giuliani’s former lawyers, including his longtime attorney Robert Costello, have sued Giuliani for failing to pay their legal fees. Meanwhile, Giuliani’s ex-wife says he owes her more than $260,000 for her country club memberships, condominium fees, and health care as part of their divorce settlement. Giuliani narrowly avoided jail time over that lawsuit in December. And one of Giuliani’s former associates sued him in May, accusing him of promising to pay her a $1 million annual salary but instead sexually harassing and abusing her over two years. Joe Biden is finally fed up with his second-rate polling numbers. The night before the president took off to celebrate Thanksgiving, he gathered his closest aides in the White House to talk about a game plan for his tanking numbers, according to several unnamed sources who spoke to The Washington Post. For months, the president and his first lady had expressed frustration at the Democrat’s disappointing numbers, but the night before Thanksgiving proved to be a turning point in which Biden complained to his team that his numbers were unacceptably low. That night, he asked his team what they planned to do about it, according to the outlet. At the time of the meeting, Biden was neck-and-neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. But Biden’s numbers have only continued to plummet since then, likely influenced by the president’s foreign policy: Many Democrats reject his unwavering support of the Israeli invasion of Gaza while others are frustrated by his inability to wrangle Congress to send along more aid to the Ukrainian war front against Russia. At the same time, Biden is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote while Trump curried 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Top Democrats have warned for months that the Biden campaign had failed to scale up its national campaign quickly enough. Just one year out from Election Day 2024, the campaign has only recently announced leadership teams in battleground states like Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and South Carolina, according to campaign officials. “The Republican primary could end quickly, and the general election could begin in weeks, not months,” Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, told the Post. “Given Trump’s noisiness and his ability to bully his way through the daily information wars, I think it’s really important that the Biden campaign move into general election mode as soon as possible. We’re not where we want to be. Some of our coalition is wandering, and we need to go get them back.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams has an interesting opinion on what makes the Big Apple so great: It could be subject to a terrorist attack at any moment. In a Monday interview, Adams was asked to sum up 2023 in one word. “New York,” Adams replied, which is technically two words. “This is a place where everyday you wake up, you could experience everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a person who’s celebrating a new business that’s open. This is a very, very complicated city, and that’s why it’s the greatest city on the globe.” The utter lack of imagination in Adams’s “one word” answer aside, this is an extremely bad take. A city isn’t great because one of the most traumatic experiences in recent American memory happened there. And you certainly aren’t going to curry favor with your constituents by warning them it could easily happen again. Adams has been in office for about two years, and he recently recorded the lowest-ever approval rating for a New York mayor. A poll released in early December by Quinnipiac University found just 28 percent of respondents said they approved of Adams’s performance. His popularity certainly isn’t helped by his penchant for very strange behavior. In August, Adams chose to mark the anniversary of Indian independence by comparing himself to Gandhi. Adams has also repeatedly said he has carried a photo of a fallen police officer in his wallet for decades. Instead, Adams allegedly instructed his staff in 2022 to print out the photo and then age it with coffee stains. Meanwhile, the mayor is facing a federal investigation into his campaign, as well as an accusation of sexual assault from 30 years ago. Elon Musk may be held accountable for X (formerly Twitter) devolving into a hellscape. The European Commission on Monday opened multiple investigations into the platform under the bloc’s new social media law. The Digital Services Act went into effect in Europe in late August. The sweeping new rulebook aims to create safer online environments: Digital platforms are required to prevent and remove posts that contain illegal goods, services, or content. Targeted ads based on sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs are prohibited, and ads targeting children are heavily restricted. “We now have clear rules, ex-ante obligations, strong oversight, speedy enforcement and deterrent sanctions and we will make full use of our toolbox to protect our citizens and democracies,” EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told Politico. The infringement proceedings into X are the commission’s first ever under the DSA. The four probes will look at whether the platform violated rules on combating illegal content and disinformation, as well as rules on transparency regarding advertising and data sharing. Investigators will also seek to determine if X misled its users when it changed its blue-check system. The check marks used to indicate that a user’s identity had been verified, but they now show that the user is paying a subscription fee in exchange for increased visibility. The investigations do not immediately indicate wrongdoing. But if X is found culpable, the company could face fines of up to 6 percent of its global revenue. The commission has also taken preliminary steps to investigate other major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. Investigators have requested information to see how the platforms combat illegal content and disinformation, and how they protect minors. This isn’t the first time the European Commission has taken aim at X owner Musk. In November, the bloc froze ads on the platform, following a Media Matters report that found X has been placing ads for brands including Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Xfinity next to posts that promote Hitler and Nazi beliefs. Hate speech has flourished on X in the little more than a year since Musk bought the platform. The social media research group National Contagion Research Institute found that in the 12 hours after Musk bought X, use of the n-word increased almost 500 percent. And Musk is often a major source of that hate speech and disinformation. In addition to aggressively antisemitic posts, Musk also regularly lets Nazis back on X, shares transphobic content, and spreads conspiracy theories. The American people will never be rid of George Santos—at least not according to him. In a one-on-one interview with comedian Ziwe on Monday, the indicted former Long Island representative said that he would one day return to Congress after outliving the members who voted to expel him, claiming he’ll have plenty of time since he’s only 35 years old. It’s not the first time that Santos has threatened his return to the House’s lower chamber. “I’m not done with public service. I want to go back to Congress,” Santos told radio host Frank Morano on Wednesday, just two weeks after he stormed out of Congress claiming he was done with politics. “I’m not saying today. I’m not saying tomorrow.” “I have a lot of things I need to take care of first,” he said on the program. “I think we all know, but I do have hopes of trying to regain the trust of the American people and going there, because I will continue to expose and root out the rot in our federal government.” Whether or not Santos returns to Congress, it’s unlikely we’ll get him entirely out of our system. The Republican is reportedly making more than $80,000 per day for bespoke videos on the mid-tier celebrity messaging platform Cameo—significantly more than his $174,000 congressional salary during his nine-month term. According to Santos, the only way we’ll stop seeing him is if comedians, producers, and interviewers “stop inviting [him] to your gigs.” “But you can’t because you want the content,” he quipped. i asked george santos if he knew who james baldwin was. watch the FULL interview on YouTube now. link in bio pic.twitter.com/1GsimbKAL7 In another dystopian twist in the interview, Santos rapped Nicki Minaj’s verse from Kanye West’s “Monster” after failing to identify Marsha P. Johnson, James Baldwin, and Harvey Milk. The confrontational comedian also got down to brass tacks with Santos over the baby debacle, in which the politician emerged holding a mysterious baby mid-meltdown while feuding with a Palestinian activist just weeks before his expulsion. Clarence Thomas was in so much debt two decades ago that he tried to get Supreme Court justice salaries raised across the board. Within months, Republican billionaires began giving him extravagant gifts. Thomas spoke at a conservative conference in January 2000, according to a new ProPublica report. In what we now know to be classic Thomas style, he did not report that trip on his financial disclosure forms. On the way home, he sat next to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns. During the flight, Thomas complained bitterly that his salary—then $173,600—was insufficient. He even hinted that multiple justices could resign in the next year if they weren’t given a pay raise. Thomas’s words sparked a rush of attempts on Capitol Hill to significantly raise the justices’ salaries or at least ensure their pay kept pace with inflation. Specifically, Republicans wanted to make sure that Thomas and his fellow staunch conservative Antonin Scalia did not leave the bench. Thomas also petitioned then–Chief Justice William Rehnquist to lift a ban on justices giving paid speeches. Ultimately, the attempts to give justices more money all failed. But soon after, a group of Republican billionaire megadonors began lavishing Thomas and his family with a steady stream of gifts. It is still unclear what exactly prompted the gift-giving, or if it was directly tied to Thomas’s money complaints. But certainly, many of those gifts have alleviated the justice’s financial concerns. One of those generous souls is billionaire Harlan Crow, who has been friends with Thomas for more than two decades. In that time, Crow—a Nazi memorabilia collector—has repeatedly lavished Thomas with expensive gifts. These include island-hopping yacht vacations, private school tuition for Thomas’s nephew, and buying and renovating a Thomas family property, where Thomas’s mother still lives. Crow has also regularly brought Thomas as his guest to the Bohemian Grove, which ProPublica has previously described as a “secretive all-men’s retreat in Northern California” that attracts major corporate and political players. Looking at Thomas’s finances, though, it would seem that keeping pace with inflation wasn’t the main issue. When he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1991, he still had student loans from law school. But during the early 1990s, he made at least two big purchases: a Corvette and a house in Virginia with five acres of land. Thomas and his wife bought the house for $522,000 in 1992. They were able to pay $8,000 out of pocket and had to borrow the rest, according to property records. The couple borrowed huge sums of money throughout the next decade, including a consumer loan of $50,000 and a $100,000 line of credit on their house. In 1998, Thomas became his grandnephew’s legal guardian and began sending him to pricey private schools. The month before Thomas complained about his salary to Stearns, he had borrowed $267,000 from a friend to buy a luxury R.V. That purchase partially paid off, though: In 2001, Thomas took his R.V. to get serviced outside Tampa. While there, he met Earl Dixon, the owner of a Florida pest control company, who ended up giving Thomas $5,000 for his grandnephew’s tuition. “My wife and I are doing fine. We don’t live extravagantly, but we are fine.” A few weeks later, Crow took the Thomases on a yacht vacation.

,,Biden needs young voters. Can his climate policy rally them?,"Celebrate 25 years of reporting on the ever-evolving world of energy and the environment. Join us 7-DAY UNLIMITED ACCESS  To win a second term, the president must reach what one expert called the “untapped potential” of young Americans who don’t know about his climate policies. President Joe Biden smiles at a group of young supporters last year at the Democratic National Committee winter meeting in Philadelphia. Matt Rourke/AP President Joe Biden has to compete against two foes in November’s election: former President Donald Trump and the living room couch. Young people helped deliver victories for Democrats in the last two election cycles, motivated by issues like climate change, abortion rights and gun control. But Biden risks losing some of those voters — not to Trump, his likely opponent, but to disaffection. Come Nov. 5, many young people might just stay home, pollsters and other experts told E&E News. “I don’t think there’s a risk that any substantial number of them would go over and vote for Donald Trump, but I do think there’s a real risk that they won’t be energized and that they’ll stay home,” said Tom Bonier, a longtime Democratic political strategist and senior adviser to TargetSmart polling firm. Young voters have turned out in record numbers in recent years, becoming key not only to Biden’s 2020 win, but also to Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm elections and 2023 off-year elections. But there are already warning signs that 2024 could be different. A recent poll from Harvard University’s Institute of Politics found that 49 percent of people 29 and younger say they “definitely” plan to vote in the presidential election — down from 57 percent at this point in the 2020 election cycle. One piece of good news for Democrats is that young Republicans and independents account for the largest share of that drop. Still, Biden in particular may need to rally young voters to win a second term. In the 2020 election, young voter turnout was a record 50 percent nationally, a sharp 11-percentage-point increase from 2016, according to Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. That turnout topped 50 percent in many of the key swing states that delivered the election to Biden, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. “When you consider the role that young voters played in Biden’s victory three years ago, it’s going to be really important for him and his coalition to be able to energize young voters and get them out to vote,” Bonier said. People aged 29 and younger who expect to vote in this year’s election rank the economy, gun control and climate change as their top issues, the Tufts survey found. The climate voters are the most motivated. Seventy-two percent of those who ranked climate policy as their top issue said they were likely to vote, according to the survey. That same group was 37 percent more likely to say they would vote Democratic. But there are still many climate-minded voters who would need to be convinced that they should vote for Biden. The Tufts survey found a significant number of young people are worried about climate change and believe political leaders have done nothing to address it, said Sara Suzuki, a senior researcher at Tufts. The vast majority have heard nothing from any campaign. Overall, only about 1 in 5 young people surveyed had heard from any campaign. “There’s really a gap and untapped potential among young people who really have this concern but don’t know what is being done,” she said. Biden has overseen the most aggressive climate policy of any president in modern history. The Inflation Reduction Act — which he signed into law in 2022 — injected billions of dollars into electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines and other clean energy technology. In the last year, EV sales broke records, tens of thousands of U.S. clean energy manufacturing jobs were created and the first offshore wind turbines came online. This year, the administration will roll out major new climate rules and regulations that will limit planet-warming emissions from power plants and vehicles, implement new fees on methane emissions, and impose more stringent requirements on the fossil fuel industry to calculate its greenhouse gas pollution. Under Biden, EPA has also sharply increased its estimate for the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions, which can help federal agencies justify stricter climate rules. And yet, many Americans are unaware of Biden’s efforts, let alone his landmark climate law. A majority of Americans, or 58 percent, have only heard a “little” about the Inflation Reduction Act, a Yale University survey released last month showed. At the same time, the administration’s fossil fuel policies have angered some of the young progressives that Biden will need in November. That’s because Biden has also overseen record levels of oil and gas production. The U.S. is now producing a daily average of about 13.2 million barrels of crude oil, up from a peak of 13 million under Trump and more than the next two top-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Some fossil fuel projects advanced by the administration, especially Alaska’s Willow project and Mountain Valley pipeline in West Virginia, are also targets of viral TikTok videos, alienating at least some segments of young voters. Despite those challenges, the Biden campaign is preparing to use climate policy as one of the sharpest contrasts with Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris will be a key part of that outreach, White House officials say. Biden and Harris will spend the year “laying out the dire stakes of this election so they can secure reelection and continue to advance the essential work of creating clean energy jobs and leading the world toward a more sustainable future,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster. Harris will continue last year’s strategy of talking about climate policy with college audiences and social media influencers, while also attending groundbreakings for clean energy projects around the country. She is also expected to focus her speeches on climate — even during unrelated events. During a visit last week to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, for example, Harris talked about the importance of improving air quality for local front-line communities. “I think you’ll see on the youth engagement part a continued effort for the vice president to go to where young people are, use platforms young people use and speak in a way that is resonant to young folks,” said Ike Irby, special assistant to the president and deputy domestic policy adviser to the vice president. The White House and its allies are now running a nationwide education campaign on Biden’s climate policies and the work that still needs to be done in a second term. That includes an $80 million effort from Climate Power, a communications organization that is partnering with super political action committee Future Forward to rally voters in the key swing states expected to decide the election. Voters of Tomorrow, an organization focused on mobilizing and engaging Gen Z voters, is also joining the effort, conducting outreach on college campuses and reaching out to people who will be voting in their first presidential election. Many young people want Biden to do more on climate, but also recognize that they “have a seat at the table” with him, whereas Trump has ignored their concerns, said Jack Lobel, the group’s spokesperson and a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia University. There is still time to highlight the massive difference between the two candidates, he said, and shrink the pool of young voters who don’t know what Biden has already accomplished on climate policy. “When we see this disconnect between Joe Biden and his policies, that presents opportunities for us,” he said. “It’s not a bad sign, it’s just a sign we have a lot of work to do.” Request a FREE trial to receive unlimited access to  The transformation of the energy sector.

,,"Remarks by President Biden on Protecting the Sacred, Constitutional Right to Vote"," National Constitution Center
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 2:46 P.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT:   Thank you.  (Applause.)  I see an awful lot of good friends out there.  Please have a seat if you have one.  I — let me begin by saying I used to be important.  (Laughter.)  I used to be the chairman of the board of this place.  And Jeffrey Rosen allowed me to do that for a while. But thank you all for being here.  I truly appreciate it.  Governor, it’s above and beyond the call.  Mr. Mayor, I’d compli- — I thought you were a great mayor — still think you are — but your judgment in fiancées is even stronger.  And — but — but all of you.  And a good friend, Bobby Brady.  I see so many friends out.  Al Sharpton — Al, how are you, pal?  It’s great to see you.  (Applause.) And I’m — I’m going to get in trouble here because I’m going to recognize my congresswoman from the state of Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester — (applause) — and her sister who used to run my office.  Stand up.  (Applause.) Well, folks, good afternoon.  There’s a serious subject I’d like to talk about today.  I’m here in Philadelphia at the National Constitution Center — the city and the place where the story of “We the People” — “We the People” began. It’s a story that’s neither simple nor straightforward.  That’s because the story is the sum of our parts, and all those parts are fundamentally human.  And being human is to be imperfect, driven by appetite and ambition as much as by goodness and grace. But some things in America should be simple and straightforward. Perhaps the most important of those things — the most fundamental of those things — is the right to vote.  The right to vote freely.  (Applause)  The right to vote freely, the right  — the right to vote fairly, the right to have your vote counted.  The democratic threshold is liberty.  With it, anything is possible.  Without it, nothing — nothing.  And for our democracy and the work — and to deliver our work and [for] our people, it’s up to all of us to protect that right.  This is a test of our time and what I’m here to talk about today. Just think about the past election.  A 102-year-old woman in Arkansas who voted for the first time on the very spot she once picked cotton. A 94-year-old woman in Michigan who voted early and in person in her seventy-se- — 72nd consecutive election.  You know what she said?  She said this election was, quote, “the most important vote that we ever had.” The daughter who voted in the memory of her dad who died of COVID-19 so others wouldn’t have the experience of pain and darkness and loss that she was going through.  Patients out there.  And the parents — the parents who voted for school their children will learn in.  Sons and daughters voted for the planet they’re going to live on. Young people just turning 18 and everyone who, for the first time in their lives, thought they could truly make a difference. America — America and Americans of every background voted.  They voted for good jobs and higher wages.  They voted for racial equity and justice.  They voted to make healthcare a right, not a privilege. And the reason that Americans went to vote and the lengths they went to vote — to be able to vote in this past election were absolutely extraordinary.  In fact, the fact that so many election officials across the country made it easier and safer for them to be able to vote in the middle of a pandemic was remarkable. As a result, in 2020, more people voted in America than ever — ever in the history of America, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic.  (Applause.) All told, more than 150 [million] Americans of every age, of every race, of every background exercised their right to vote. They voted early.  They voted absentee.  They voted in person.  They voted by mail.  They voted by drop box.  And then they got their families and friends to go out and vote. Election officials, the entire electoral system, withstood unrelenting political attacks, physical threats, intimidation, and pressure.  They did so with unyielding courage and faith in our democracy. With recount after recount after recount, court case after court case, the 2020 election was the most scrutinized election ever in American history.  Challenge after challenge brought to local, state, and election officials; state legislatures; state and federal courts — even to the United States Supreme Court not once, but twice. More than 80 judges, including those appointed by my predecessor, heard the arguments.  In every case, neither cause nor evidence was found to undermine the national achievement of administering this historic election in the face of such extraordinary challenges.   Audits, recounts were conducted in Arizona, in Wisconsin. In Georgia, it was recounted three times.  It’s clear.  For those who challenge the results and question the integrity of the election: No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny and such high standards. The Big Lie is just that: a big lie.  (Applause.) The 2020 election — it’s not hyperbole to suggest — the most examined and the fullest expression of the will of the people in the history of this nation.  This should be celebrated — the example of America at its best.  But instead, we continue to see an example of human nature at its worst — something darker and more sinister. In America, if you lose, you accept the results.  You follow the Constitution.  You try again.  You don’t call facts “fake” and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy.  That’s not statesmanship.  (Applause.)  That’s not statesmanship; that’s selfishness.  That’s not democracy; it’s the denial of the right to vote.  It suppresses.  It subjugates.  The denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine, the most undemocratic, the most unpatriotic, and yet, sadly, not unprecedented. From denying enslaved people fu- — full citizenship until the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War; to denying women the right to vote until the 19th Amendment 100 years ago; to poll taxes and literacy tests, and the Ku Klux Klan campaigns of violence and terror that lasted into the ‘50s and ‘60s; to the Supreme Court decision in 2013 and then again just two weeks ago –- a decision that weakened the landmark Voting Rights Act; to the willful attacks — election attacks in 2020; and then to a whole other level of threat — the violence and the deadly insurrection on the Capitol on January 6th. I just got back from Europe, speaking to the G7 and to NATO.  They wonder — not a joke — they wonder, Gov — they ask me, “Is it going to be okay?”  The citadel of democracy in the world, “Is it o- — going to be okay?” Time and again, we’ve weathered threats to the right to vote in free and fair elections.  And each time, we found a way to overcome.  And that’s what we must do today. Vice President Harris and I have spent our careers doing this work.  And I’ve asked her to lead, to bring people together to protect the right to vote and our democracy.  And it starts with continuing the fight to pass H.R.1, the For the People Act.  (Applause.) That bill — that bill would help end voter suppression in the states, get dark money out of politics, give voice to the people at the grassroots level, create a fairer district maps, and end partisan political gerrymandering.  Last month, Republicans opposed even debating, even considering For the People Act.  Senate Democrats stood united to protect our democracy and the sanctity of the vote.  We must pass the For the People Act.  It’s a national imperative.  We must also fight for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and expand — (applause) — to restore and expand voting protections and prevent voter suppression.  All the congresswomen and men here — there’s a bunch of you — you knew John, many of you. Just weeks ago, the Supreme Court yet again weakened the Voting Rights Act and upheld what Justice Kagan called, quote, “a significant race-based disparity in voting opportunities.” The Court’s decision, as harmful as is, does not limit the — Congress’ ability to repair the damage done.  That’s the important point.  It puts the burden back on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act to its intended strength. As soon as Congress passes the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, I will sign it and let the whole world see it.  (Applause.)  That will be an important moment.  And the world is wondering — the world is wondering — and Dwight knows what I’m talking about, for real.  You know, the world is wondering, “What is America going to do?” But we also have to clear-eyed about the obstruction we face.  Legislation is one tool, but not the only tool.  And it’s not the only measure of our obligation to defend democracy today.  For example, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the United States Department of Justice is going to be using its authorities to challenge the onslaught of state laws undermining voting rights in old and new ways.  (Applause.) The focus — the focus will be on dismantling racially discriminatory laws, like the recent challenge to Georgia’s vicious anti-voting law. The Department of Justice will do so with a voting rights division that — at my request — is doubling its size in enforcement staff.  (Applause) Civil rights groups — civil rights groups and other organizations have announced their plans to stay vigilant and challenge these odious laws in the courts. In Texas, for example, Republican-led state legislature wants to allow partisan poll watchers to intimidate voters and imperil impartial poll workers.  They want voters to dive [drive] farther and be able to be in a position where they wonder who’s watching them and intimidating them; to wait longer to vote.  To drive a hell of lot lo- — excuse me — a long way — (laughter) — to get to vote.  They want to make it so hard and inconvenient that they hope people don’t vote at all.  That’s what this is about. This year alone, 17 states have enacted — not just proposed, but enacted — 28 new laws to make it harder for Americans to vote, not to mention — and catch this — nearly 400 additional bills Republican members of the state legislatures are trying to pass. The 21st century Jim Crow assault is real.  It’s unrelenting, and we’re going to challenge it vigorously.  While — (applause) — while this broad assault against voting rights is not unprecedented, it’s taking on a new and, literally, pernicious forms. It’s no longer just about who gets to vote or making it easier for eligible voters to vote.  It’s about who gets to count the vote — who gets to count whether or not your vote counted at all.  It’s about moving from independent election administrators who work for the people to polarized state legislatures and partisan actors who work for political parties. To me, this is simple: This is election subversion.  It’s the most dangerous threat to voting and the integrity of free and fair elections in our history.  Never before have they decided who gets to count — count — what votes count. Some — some legi- — state legislatures want to make it harder for you to vote.  And if you vote, they want to be able to tell you your vote doesn’t count for any reason they make up. They want the ability to reject the final count and ignore the will of the people if their preferred candidate loses. And they’re trying — not only targeting people of color, they’re targeting voters of all races and backgrounds.  It’s with a simple target: who did not vote for them.  That’s the target. It’s unconscionable.  I mean, really, I — it’s hard to — it’s hard to declare just how critical this is.  It’s simply unconscionable. We’ve got to shore up our election system and address the threats of election subversion, not just from abroad — which I spent time with Putin talking about — but from home.  From home. We must ask those who represent us at the federal, state, and local levels: Will you deny the will of the people?  Will you ignore their voices? We have to ask: Are you on the side of truth or lies; fact or fiction; justice or injustice; democracy or autocracy?  That’s what it’s coming down to. Which brings me to perhaps the most important thing we have to do: We have to for- — forge a coalition of Americans of every background and political party — the advocates, the students, the faith leaders, the labor leaders, the business executives — and raise the urgency of this moment. Because as much as people know they’re screwing around with the election process, I don’t think that most people think this is about who gets to count what vote counts — literally, not figuratively.  You vote for certain electors to vote for somebody for President.  State legislator comes along — under their proposal — and they say, “No, we don’t like those electors.  We’re going to appoint other electors who are going to vote for the other guy or other woman.” Because here’s the deal: In 2020, democracy was put to a test — first by the pandemic; then by a desperate attempt to deny the reality and the results of the election; and then by a violent and deadly insurrection on the Capitol, the citadel of our democracy. I’ve been around a long time in public life.  I thought I’ve seen it all or most of it all.  But I never thought I’d see that, for real.  And in spite of what you see on television — and you saw it — you have senators saying it was just a day at the Capitol, just people visiting the Capitol. Folks — but we met the test.  Because of the extraordinary courage of election officials — many of them Republicans; our court system; and those brave Capitol police officers — because of them, democracy held. Look how close it came.  I mean, for real, how close it came.  We’re going to face another test in 2022: a new wave of unprecedented voter suppression, and raw and sustained election subversion.  We have to prepare now. As I’ve said time and again: No matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting.  They will decide, and the power must always be with the people. That’s why, just like we did in 2020, we have to prepare for 2022.  We’ll engage in an all-out effort to educate voters about the changing laws, register them to vote, and then get the vote out. We’ll encourage people to run for office themselves at every level. We will be asking my Republican friends — in Congress, in states, in cities, in counties — to stand up, for God’s sake, and help prevent this concerted effort to undermine our elections and the sacred right to vote.  (Applause.)  Have you no shame?  (Applause.) Whether it’s stopping foreign interference in our elections or the spread of disinformation from within, we have to work together. Vice President Harris and I will be making it clear that there’s real peril in making raw power, rather than the idea of liberty, the centerpiece of the common life. The Founders understood this.  The women of Seneca Falls understood this.  The brave, heroic foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement understood this.  So must we. This isn’t about Democrats and Republicans; it’s literally about who we are as Americans.  It’s that basic.  It’s about the kind of country we want today, the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren tomorrow.  And quite frankly, the whole world is watching.  Folks — (applause). I’m not being sentimental.  I’m not preaching to you.  I’m just giving it to you straight, as I promised I would always do — lay things out on the line and honor your trust with trust [truth]. So hear me clearly: There is an unfolding assault taking place in America today — an attempt to suppress and subvert the right to vote in fair and free elections, an assault on democracy, an assault on liberty, an assault on who we are — who we are as Americans.  For, make no mistake, bullies and merchants of fear and peddlers of lies are threatening the very foundation of our country.  It gives me no pleasure to say this.  I never thought in my entire career I’d ever have to say it.  But I swore an oath to you, to God — to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.  And that’s an oath that forms a sacred trust to defend America against all threats both foreign and domestic.  (Applause.)  The assault on free and fair elections is just such a threat, literally.  I’ve said it before: We’re are facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.  That’s not hyperbole.  Since the Civil War.  The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol as insurrectionists did on January the 6th. I’m not saying this to alarm you; I’m saying this because you should be alarmed.   I’m also saying this: There’s good news.  It doesn’t have to be this way.  It doesn’t have to be, for real.  We have the means.  We just need to show the will — the will to save and strengthen our democracy.  We did it in 20- — we did it in the 2020.  The battle for the soul of America — in that battle, the people voted.  Democracy prevailed.  Our Constitution held.  We have to do it again.   My fellow Americans, it requires fair-mindedness; devotion to justice; corny as it sounds, a love of country.  It requires us to unite in common purpose, to declare here and now: We, the people, will never give up.  (Applause.)  We will not give in.  We will overcome.  We will do it together.  And guaranteeing the right to vote, ensuring every vote is counted has always been the most patriotic thing we can do.  (Applause.)   Just remember, our late friend John Lewis said, “Freedom is not a state; it is an act.”  “Freedom is not a state; it is an act.”  And we must act, and we will act.  For our cause is just, our vision is clear, and our hearts are full.  (Applause.)  For “We the People,” for our democracy, for America itself, we must act.  (Applause.) God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops and all those stand watch over our democracy.  (Applause.)  But act.  We’ve got to act.  Thank you.  (Applause.) 3:10 P.M. EDT   The White House

,,,"2020 ELECTIONS Advisers weigh the merits of a one-term pledge by the 77-year-old former vice president. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. | Win McNamee/Getty Images 12/11/2019 05:06 AM EST Updated: 12/11/2019 06:24 PM EST  Former Vice President Joe Biden’s top advisers and prominent Democrats outside the Biden campaign have recently revived a long-running debate whether Biden should publicly pledge to serve only one term, with Biden himself signaling to aides that he would serve only a single term. While the option of making a public pledge remains available, Biden has for now settled on an alternative strategy: quietly indicating that he will almost certainly not run for a second term while declining to make a promise that he and his advisers fear could turn him into a lame duck and sap him of his political capital. According to four people who regularly talk to Biden, all of whom asked for anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters, it is virtually inconceivable that he will run for reelection in 2024, when he would be the first octogenarian president. “If Biden is elected,” a prominent adviser to the campaign said, “he’s going to be 82 years old in four years and he won’t be running for reelection.” The adviser argued that public acknowledgment of that reality could help Biden mollify younger voters, especially on the left, who are unexcited by his candidacy and fear that his nomination would serve as an eight-year roadblock to the next generation of Democrats. “This makes Biden a good transition figure,” the adviser said. “I’d love to have an election this year for the next generation of leaders, but if I have to wait four years [in order to] to get rid of Trump, I’m willing to do it.” Another top Biden adviser put it this way: “He’s going into this thinking, ‘I want to find a running mate I can turn things over to after four years but if that’s not possible or doesn’t happen then I’ll run for reelection.’ But he’s not going to publicly make a one term pledge.” In elite Democratic circles, conversations about Biden’s age and whether to address it with a one-term pledge have become more urgent in recent weeks as Biden has solidified his once shaky standing in the Democratic primaries. “I’d love to have an election this year for the next generation of leaders, but if I have to wait four years [in order to] to get rid of Trump, I’m willing to do it.” Biden adviser Since Thanksgiving there has been a gradual shift among prominent Democrats once deeply skeptical of Biden’s candidacy. In national polls, Elizabeth Warren, who was on a trajectory to topple Biden, has lost all the gains she achieved since July and fallen to third place. Pete Buttigieg, who has replaced Warren as the hot candidate among white college-educated voters, has shown no evidence that, even as he thrills a subset of the Democratic electorate in Iowa, he can achieve broad appeal among African American and Latino voters. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who won 43 percent of the primary vote in 2016, has been unable to break out of the mid-teens for most of this year. Biden’s base of older working-class white and African American voters has been unassailable. A year of national polling of the Democratic primary shows his remarkably consistent support. According to the Real Clear Politics national polling average on Dec. 8, 2018, Biden had 29 percent support nationally. On Dec. 8, 2019, he had 29 percent support. The greatest threats to Biden’s African American base have been neutralized. Sen. Kamala Harris has suspended her campaign. Sen. Cory Booker has struggled to qualify for the PBS NewsHour/POLITICO Debate, on Dec. 19. Former Gov. Deval Patrick, a pre-Thanksgiving entrant to the race, has barely been heard from and is polling at less than 1 percent. This current bright spot could just be some momentary sunshine for Biden before storm clouds gather. Biden’s position in Iowa and New Hampshire, overwhelmingly white states packed with college-educated Democrats unexcited by his candidacy, is middling. Poor showings in both states could upend the race. Warren, who has built a robust national campaign and is generally seen by Biden’s advisers as the strongest primary opponent remaining, could still make a comeback. Biden has struggled with fundraising, while all three of his top opponents — Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg — have demonstrated the potential to fund a long campaign against him. Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire who has quietly bought himself into fifth place by spending tens of millions of dollars on television ads, looms as a potential Super Tuesday threat on March 3, after the first four states have voted. But, for now, Biden remains the favorite, a fact that even the online betting markets, which were wildly bullish on Warren from September through November, now acknowledge. And so the question of how to address Biden’s age, which may be the candidate’s most significant liability, and the related question of the lack of enthusiasm for Biden’s candidacy among the activist wing of their party, has once again seized Democrats. A top Biden adviser said Biden ruled out a one-term pledge when the issue was raised before he even entered the race. “He said it was a nonstarter,” the adviser said, adding that Biden believed it was a “gimmick.” But Biden’s public statements on running for reelection have shifted over the course of the campaign. In April, when asked whether he would serve just one term, Biden responded, “No.” More recently, Biden has been ambiguous. In October, The Associated Press reported that when “asked whether he would pledge to only serve one term if elected, Biden said he wouldn’t make such a promise but noted he wasn’t necessarily committed to seeking a second term if elected in 2020.” ALGONA, IOWA - DECEMBER 02: Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign stop at the Water's Edge Nature Center on December 2, 2019 in Algona, Iowa.

The 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses will take place on February 3, 2020, making it the first nominating contest for the Democratic Party in choosing their presidential candidate to face Donald Trump in the 2020 election. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) | Scott Olson/Getty Images “I feel good and all I can say is, watch me, you’ll see,” he told the AP. “It doesn’t mean I would run a second term. I’m not going to make that judgment at this moment.” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director and deputy campaign manager, declined to comment when asked whether Biden had ruled out running for reelection if he wins the Democratic nomination and defeats Trump. After this article was published Bedingfield told POLITICO that Biden will not make a one-term pledge and is “not privately considering declining to run for re-election.” Several advisers downplayed the idea of a formal pledge. Others emphasized that there were better ways to address concerns about Biden’s age, such as using his age as a proxy for experience. (Biden recently challenged a voter to an IQ test or push-up competition.) But the issue remains a topic of debate inside and outside the campaign, and several advisers now quietly acknowledge that while Biden won’t run for reelection he cannot say so publicly. But the case for going public has some advocates. A political strategist who has recently talked to one of Biden’s closest advisers made the argument for serving one term this way: “Is 81 years old too old to be president? Yes. Is an eighty-one year-old president standing for reelection likely to be successful? He is not. And is it the right thing to do for the country? No. Biden wouldn’t be running if it were President Jeb Bush or President Marco Rubio. He’s running because it’s an exigent circumstance — Donald Trump. The next president will have to have oppositional virtues to the last president. We have a presidency that is defined by abject selfishness, self-regard and self-interest. So a one-term pledge would be viewed as an act of selflessness, putting the country ahead of any ambition.” One adviser to Biden who favors a one-term pledge argued that if he wins and his presidency is a success, and he’s healthy enough to run for reelection he could always reverse the pledge if Democrats wanted him to remain their candidate in 2024. But many prominent Democrats believe a public pledge to serve only one term would do more harm than good, a conclusion also reached by Republican advisers to John McCain in 2008, when the then-72-year-old GOP nominee considered making such a commitment. “That’s a weak play,” said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman. “I think who his vice president is will be very important because people will be thinking about that. But I don’t think I would make a one-term pledge. You’ve disempowered yourself as president, and I don’t think it helps you as a candidate. It accentuates your weakness. It doesn’t fix it.” That’s why the campaign’s current course of strategic ambiguity may be the best approach for Biden right now, key advisers believe. It keeps the issue alive without ruling out a more formal pledge later on. If Biden’s fortunes decline and the pledge makes more political sense it can always be revived. Alternatively, if being seen as a one-termer weakens him in the primary or general election, he can say unequivocally that he will seek reelection. “I think he should make [the one-term pledge] privately to himself and his wife and no one else,” said one well-known Democratic strategist. “You can’t let the cat out of the bag. Go back to that old Jimmy Breslin essay on power — you know it’s a lot of smoke and mirrors. If you begin your first day as president as a lame duck, it changes everything. Every Cabinet secretary, every subcommittee chairman treats you differently. I wouldn’t advise it, just from a governing perspective as well as political.” He added, “But I would actually do it because it’s crazy for him to run for a second term. It’s a bit crazy to run for a first.” Natasha Korecki contributed to this report.  The unofficial guide to official Washington, every morning and weekday afternoons.

,,Biden gives an angry cry for action on voting rights but stops short of calling for filibuster reform,"President Joe Biden issued a dire and angry warning Tuesday that the very underpinnings of American democracy were under threat, calling an ongoing assault on voting rights the gravest challenge to American democracy since the Civil War. But he stopped short of embracing changes to Senate procedure that might open the door to new laws protecting those rights, a step activists have said is essential as they urge the President to say and do more on an issue he’s said is the most important of his presidency. The President’s speech in Philadelphia, the birthplace of American democracy, was meant as an opening salvo in what officials say will be an ongoing push against restrictive voting laws being passed around the nation. In it, Biden took particular aim at his predecessor Donald Trump and other Republicans who have refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election, accusing them of fomenting a pattern of denial that is fracturing the country’s foundations. “In America, if you lose, you accept the results,” Biden said inside the soaring atrium of the National Constitution Center. “You follow the Constitution, you try again. You don’t call facts ‘fake’ and then try to bring down the American experiment just because you’re unhappy. That’s not statesmanship. That’s selfishness.” It was the most forcefully Biden has inveighed against Trump since taking office. At one point, accusing Republicans of shirking truth and responsibility for upholding the Constitution, he bellowed: “Have you no shame?” One of the fieriest speeches of Biden’s presidency to date, Biden’s remarks reflected the fury he and fellow Democrats have cultivated as Republicans follow Trump’s lead in denying the election results. He predicted it is likely Republicans will use a similar strategy in the 2022 midterms, saying “we have to prepare now.” He called efforts to call the election in question “dark” and “sinister” on Tuesday, saying they reflected “human nature at its worst.” “Bullies and merchants of fear, peddlers of lies, are threatening the very foundation of our country,” Biden said. Still, his avoidance of the filibuster issue proved disappointing to some of the activists who want Biden to embrace changes that would allow new legislation in Congress. “Supporters of democracy will continue to organize and advocate, but we cannot organize our way out of this threat. It is up to our elected officials to hear supporters and act to protect our democracy,” said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, after Biden’s speech. Asked on his way out of the venue why he did not raise the filibuster, Biden told reporters only: “I’m not filibustering now.” He began his speech by recounting the stories of Americans who voted in the last election, lauding them for their efforts to cast their ballots amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He noted the 2020 contest had the most votes cast in any election in American history. But he quickly turned his focus to the attacks on the 2020 election process, calling it the most scrutinized in American history. He alluded to Trump’s complaints about the election results, saying those who would deny the election result are simply denying facts. “The Big Lie is just that: A big lie,” Biden said. Since the November election, state lawmakers have enacted 28 laws in 17 states that restrict ballot access, according to a June tally by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Biden decried Republican obstruction to a sweeping election reform bill that Democrats argue is a necessary counter to state-level efforts to restrict voting access. The President stressed that he would work to pass that legislation, the For the People Act, as well as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. RELATED: Seventeen states have enacted 28 new laws making it harder to vote But he seemed to quietly acknowledge the low likelihood that either bill becomes law, saying instead he would “engage in an all-out effort” to educate Americans about laws limiting voting across the country. In recent days, the eyes of voting rights advocates have been fixed on Texas, where GOP lawmakers are mounting another push for restrictive voting laws during a 30-day special legislative session that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott says he wants to see focused in part on “election integrity.” Texas Democratic lawmakers have fled the state in an attempt to deny the special session a quorum, which would prevent any new laws from being passed. Vice President Kamala Harris, who Biden has tasked with leading the administration’s voting right efforts, planned to meet with the Texas Democrats later Tuesday. The President and his team had repeatedly previewed a major push on voting rights after Republicans in the US Senate blocked a sweeping election reform bill last month, but it remains unclear how much he can accomplish. Passing new voting legislation in Congress will almost certainly require altering filibuster rules, since Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate isn’t enough to overcome GOP opposition – and it’s not clear Democrat have the votes to pass a bill anyway. As federal voting legislation falters, state Republicans push to exert new powers over elections And Biden has said his efforts must go beyond simply limiting dark money in politics or making Election Day a federal holiday – two items included in the major bill blocked by Republicans last month. He said in June that Democratic efforts must expand to limit the ability of election boards to toss out results or replace officials based on ideology. RELATED: Biden administration spotlights voting rights as advocates push the President to do more Civil rights advocates have pushed the President to do more, and one – the Rev. Al Sharpton – told CNN after the speech that Biden was non-committal when Sharpton asked about his stance on the filibuster. “He said, ‘We’re working through, Rev, where we are going to be there.’ He didn’t commit Thursday or today, but that’s what he and I talked about. I waited to bring that up to him,” Sharpton said. Additional pressure on Biden to act came earlier this month when a Supreme Court decision limited the ability of minorities to challenge state laws they say are discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act. The high court upheld two provisions of an Arizona voting law. The first provision says in-person ballots cast at the wrong precinct on Election Day must be wholly discarded. Another provision restricts a practice known as “ballot collection,” requiring that only family caregivers, mail carriers and election officials can deliver another person’s completed ballot to a polling place. This story has been updated from more from Biden’s speech on Tuesday. CNN’s Kate Sullivan, Paul LeBlanc and Betsy Klein contributed to this report.

,,Will Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war turn off young and Muslim voters in 2024?,"""The real question ... is whether this is actually going to linger for a year."" President Joe Biden is struggling with younger voters and Muslim Americans who don't approve of the way he's handled the Israel-Hamas war, recent polling by NBC News and Quinnipiac University shows. And while some advocates suggest that could be a key factor in next year's election, some foreign policy and elections experts cautioned that it may not be so simple, still a year away from voting. ""The politics of this with younger Democrats are complicated right now,"" said Brian Goldsmith, with the consulting firm Kona Media. ""This is clearly a dividing line, especially for Democrats under 35."" While the president's solidarity with Israel is shared in these polls by a majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, the polls also showed younger voters are more likely to sympathize with Palestinians. Some younger voters who spoke with ABC News have warned they could defect to a third party or stay home next year. Even with the news of a temporary humanitarian pause and prisoner exchange deal in which Hamas has released some hostages from Gaza, these voters are saying Biden is not doing enough in light of Israel's relentless bombardment of the territory in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack. ""That's a long, long ways from what Biden could do for Gaza if he wanted to and far from what I would personally need to see to regain confidence in Biden as a candidate,"" said 30-year-old Gabriela M., who voted for Biden in 2020. Gabriela, who asked not to be quoted by her full name because she worried about potential professional repercussions discussing a divisive issue, said that if it comes down to a Biden-versus-Trump repeat in 2024, she won't be voting for either one. ""In my local elections, I'll get in my ballot,"" she told ABC News. ""But I don't want [Biden] to take my vote for granted and just assume that because he's the lesser of two evils that I'll just vote for him."" According to a Quinnipiac University national poll released in mid-November, 54% of registered voters said their sympathies lie more with the Israelis, while 24% say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians. But among younger voters, ages 18-34, 52% said their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians while 29% said the Israelis. A poll published last week by NBC News painted a more dire picture for Biden on the issue. The survey found that just 34% of registered voters approved of how he is handling the Israel-Hamas war, while 56% disapproved -- and among Democrats, only half, 51%, approved. A staggering 70% of voters ages 18-34 disapproved of Biden's handling. Broadly speaking, Democrats have become more sympathetic to the Palestinians compared with the Israelis in the last two decades, Gallup polling has found. In January, months before the Hamas attack, Democrats for the first time said their sympathies were more with the Palestinians -- a change that Middle East experts previously suggested to ABC News is driven in part by partisanship, as Israeli politics have become increasingly conservative, and the influence of domestic social movements like Black Lives Matter. Frustrations with the administration has sparked some public outcry this month, including a tense protest on Nov. 15 in front of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., while lawmakers were in the building, that led to police clashing with demonstrators. Another protest forced state party officials to cancel events at the California Democratic Convention in Sacramento on Nov. 18. Gabriela said the Israel-Hamas war is only one reason she won't be voting for the president again. ""It feels like he could have done more for student loan relief, immigration and to enshrine abortion rights in federal law or queer rights,"" she said. (Biden's push to cancel tens of millions of people's federal student loan debt was blocked by the Supreme Court, which said it was unconstitutional; his proposal to codify abortion access has not gained traction in Congress.) Earlier this month, several progressive groups, including March for Our Lives, Gen-Z for Change and the Sunrise Movement, wrote an open letter to Biden warning his handling of the war could depress turnout among millennial and Generation Z voters in 2024. ""It's still just hard for young people to justify to themselves, morally, voting for someone after seeing these images, after seeing what's been going on in the Middle East,"" 22-year-old Anish Mohanty, the communications director of Gen-Z for Change, told ABC News. Mohanty said that Biden's stance on issues like climate change is ""appreciated by our generation,"" but ""are we supposed to tell other young people, especially if they are from marginalized communities, to vote for somebody who's contributed to what's going on in the Middle East?"" The Biden administration has repeatedly said it believes Israel has the right to defend itself and seek to destroy Hamas in the wake of Oct. 7 attack, and the White House has proposed billions more in military funding for the Israelis. Hamas, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization, is also deeply embedded in civilian life in Gaza -- and the White House has tried to stress that Israel has an obligation to try and limit civilian casualties amid the large death toll. Biden has also pushed for aid to get into Gaza during Israel's retaliatory operations. More than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands more have been injured. More than 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. ""Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in early November. ""Far too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them."" Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that ""we don't live in an era where an administration can control the messaging."" ""The pictures control the messaging, and they're not photoshopped,"" he said. ""I think the administration knows that."" Miller said he sees signs of increasing concern within the Democratic Party and the Biden administration that the Israelis are pursuing ""far too aggressive a strategy and the administration is far too acquiescent,"" he said. ""You've got a very strong pro-Israeli frame, which in various constituencies in Washington has resulted in a lot of unhappiness,"" Miller said. ""In 25 years, working under half a dozen secretaries of state, I've never seen the degree of dissent or opposition to a policy vocalized so prominently in Congress, among White House staff ... [the] Department of State"" and beyond. Israeli officials have insisted that its military is taking steps to curb civilian casualties, which is complicated because Hamas fighters don't abide by international law in separating themselves from non-combatants. However, Biden's allies and outside analysts said that drawing 2024 predictions from the current problems isn't so obvious. A rematch against Trump could have its own galvanizing effect on Democratic voters, given how deeply unpopular Trump is among them, some experts said. ""I don't think young voters were super excited about Joe Biden four years ago,"" said Goldsmith, the political consultant, who supports Biden. ""But ultimately they came out in record numbers because"" of Trump. Younger voters also don't vote as often as older demographics, who have been more approving of Biden's handling of Israel and Hamas, a trend which risks undercutting the argument that younger voters' views could be decisive next year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 54% of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the 2020 election. That's compared to 67% of the population overall. Census data shows that because America is an aging country, there are also simply more older voters than younger ones. Combined with lower turnout, that weakens their influence. ""Young voters might be dissatisfied with Biden and so they won't turn out to vote for him -- well, like half of them probably weren't going to do that anyway,"" said Nathaniel Rakich, a senior elections analyst at 538. ""I think at the end of the day, most of them will realize that if they want to stop Trump, Biden is their best choice,"" Rakich added. Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz maintained that the president is not taking younger voters for granted. ""Next year's election is deeply consequential for young people, and we are working hard to highlight how an extreme MAGA agenda would devastate the financial security, safety, and freedom of young people, and how President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting for the future that America's young people deserve,"" Munoz said in a statement to ABC News. Some Muslim and Arab Americans who supported Biden in 2020 and who live in swing states like Michigan are also warning in interviews with ABC News they could sit out next year. There's less reliable polling on the extent of their feelings, but activists are speaking out. Hassan Abdel Salam is an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota who says he has grown frustrated with how the Biden administration is handling the Israel-Hamas war. He's part of group calling themselves ""Abandon Biden."" Not only do they say they won't vote for the president -- they've also promised to actively campaign against him. Salam told ABC News the group is ""committed"" to voting in the 2024 presidential election but who they will vote for in Biden's stead remains up in the air. ""It may have to be an independent candidate. We don't know who that is ... right now we're really focused on just making sure that our signal to the White House is clear,"" he said. Michigan, which has one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States, has some 206,000 registered Muslim voters, a 22% jump from 2016, according to Emgage, a Muslim American political advocacy group. Biden won the state in 2020 by only about 155,000 votes. ""Biden would be persona non grata if he entered Dearborn right now,"" Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American comedian and progressive Democratic activist, previously told ABC News, referring to a city in Michigan where half of the 110,000 residents are of Middle Eastern or North African Descent. Still, the election is many months away, polling experts and strategists said. Biden's dire approval ratings are an issue for him, but not necessarily predictive, they said. ""Probably, dissatisfaction with him among certain core Democratic groups like young voters is contributing to a bit of a polling slump these days for Biden. The real question, though, is whether this is actually going to linger for a year -- and that's the totally unknowable thing,"" said Rakich with 538. ""I don't think anybody can say with any kind of authority or precision that that's what's happening now,"" said Miller, a former deputy special Middle East coordinator at the State Department. ""If this were happening next November, that might make for a plausible case."" ""We're a year away,"" Miller said, ""an eternity in American politics."" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-handling-israel-hamas-war-turn-off-young/story?id=105039646,,
,,Biden isn’t on the ballot in New Hampshire’s primary. Here’s why,"Matt Loffman Leave your feedback Twenty-one Democratic candidates will appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, but incumbent President Joe Biden isn’t one of them. He’s the first president running for reelection to skip the Granite State primary in more than 50 years. Why? It’s all about a change to the Democratic National Committee’s rules that made South Carolina — not New Hampshire — the first official primary of the Democratic presidential nominating cycle. Because the New Hampshire primary is “non-compliant” with new DNC rules, the national party deemed the contest “meaningless.” The winner next Tuesday will be in name only, walking away with no delegates to the convention in August. New Hampshire leaders – both Republicans and Democrats – were not pleased, banding together to uphold state law that requires its voters to have the first primary New Hampshire Attorney General Brendan O’Donnell filed his own cease-and-desist letter accusing the DNC of engaging in voter suppression. “This is the election,” said New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, who oversees the state’s election process. “There is no other election taking place in New Hampshire where delegates are going to be awarded to the convention. So whether the Democratic National Committee decides to recognize those delegates or not, that’s on them.” Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.  The DNC instructed candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate” in the New Hampshire primary as currently scheduled. Two high-profile Democratic challengers ignored the DNC: Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, an author making her second run for the nomination. Biden chose to skip the state altogether. “It’s really unfortunate and sad that the president of the United States chose not to be on the New Hampshire ballot,” Scanlan told the NewsHour. “The decision not to do that comes across as petty, but New Hampshire is moving forward with or without him.” Enter the “write-in Biden” effort. It’s a grassroots and mostly volunteer campaign led by the president’s supporters in New Hampshire, and it’s running on a shoestring budget. Organizers hope to recruit thousands of volunteers to stand outside every voting location in the state to tell people how to write-in the president’s name on the ballot. Since the effort launched last fall, a super PAC has also joined the effort, spending about $1.25 million so far on direct mailings and advertising. A sample New Hampshire ballot showing all 21 Democratic candidates. Not listed? President Joe Biden. Image courtesy of New Hampshire Secretary of State While high-profile Democrats in and out of the state are vocally supportive of the write-in effort, it is unaffiliated with Biden’s official reelection campaign. The goal is simply to get Joe Biden a victory, and organizers are lowering expectations for what a victory looks like. One Democrat connected to the super PAC told the NewsHour a win is getting just one more vote than the candidate in second place. Write-in campaigns can be a logistical nightmare that require a lot of voter education. The president’s supporters have to explain to voters to look all the way at the bottom of the ballot — skipping the long list of Democratic candidates — to fill in a bubble and write the president’s name. Organizers say one thing is to their advantage: “Joe Biden” is an easy name to spell. They take comfort in the successful 2010 write-in campaign of Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, which required significant ad spending to teach voters how to spell her name. Plus, New Hampshire’s secretary of state is expected to allow misspellings to count if the voter’s intent is clear. Recent polling suggests that despite the challenges of a write-in campaign, Biden has a comfortable lead over the 21 candidates whose names are actually on the ballot. More than three-quarters of Democratic voters have decided who they will vote for, and 69 percent plan on writing in Biden’s name, according to a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll. That’s far ahead of Phillips and Williamson, who have 7 and 6 percent respectively. (In March 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last incumbent to run as a write-in candidate in New Hampshire, won a narrow 7-point victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy before dropping out of the race later that month.) Phillips entered the campaign in late October and has been trying to grow his name recognition in the months since, recently running his first ads in New Hampshire. While his advisers at one time suggested he could win more than 40 percent of the vote, Phillips recently told Politico that finishing around 20 percent “would be magnificent.” He also suggested that getting anything less than 60 percent of the vote should be troubling to the incumbent. The eventual winner of the Democratic primary will have a lot to do with voter turnout on Tuesday. With an incumbent running without major competition, the secretary of state would usually expect lower turnout in the Democratic race, but the write-in campaign is complicating his turnout projections. Scanlan estimated Friday that voter turnout would be about 410,000 voters, just less than half of registered voters in the state. Expected turnout for Republicans was close to four times that of Democrats, according to his projections. Nearly 40 percent of the state’s voters are unaffiliated with a political party and can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. That includes around 4,000 Democrats who switched their voter registration to undeclared ahead of the October deadline. Many intend to vote in the Republican primary. “The energy and the enthusiasm and the interest is clearly on the Republican side because of the number of candidates who are engaged in that race,” Scanlan said. Thalia Floras, a lifelong New Hampshire resident, changed her party registration for the first time ever ahead of this election, from Democrat to undeclared. She has grown weary about Biden’s age and thinks he should not have run for a second term. But because her vote in the Democratic primary for either Williamson or Phillips (“both great candidates,” she said) would not count toward their delegate totals, she’s planning to vote for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Republican primary instead. “I want to boost the candidate that not only could have a chance to beat Donald Trump but that I can respect as my president,” she said. Floras and her friend Hella Ross went to dozens of town hall meetings to hear from the candidates directly and learn about their positions. Ross, another lifelong Democrat, was also hoping to vote in the Democratic primary and said she would support either Phillips or Williamson as the nominee. “This particular election is calling for desperate measures,” she said. Like her friend, she plans to vote for Haley, who she believes is “best positioned right now to defeat Trump.” The prospect of Democrats staying home or undeclared voters choosing a Republican ballot is just one of the complicated calculations ahead of election day next week. A Democratic primary with potentially a large number of write-in votes will complicate counting, too. Many smaller towns in the state hand count all of their ballots. Larger cities will have machines that separate out the write-in ballots that will then be counted by hand. Local election officials have been recruiting extra volunteers to help with the counting, which will continue on primary night until every vote is counted. That won’t be unusually late, the secretary of state said. Despite the hand count, there is just one race on the ballot, which Scanlan said will simplify the process. He expects most of the results to be reported by 10 p.m. local time, just two hours after the last polls close.

,,Biden losing Arab-American voters in swing state,"President Joe Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has sparked anger in a state that helped deliver him victory in 2020. Will there be a political cost? Nadia Ayoub is desperately scrolling through social media, looking for 18-year-old Mohamed Raed Abu Hussain among images coming out of Gaza. ""I zoom into these horrible graphic pictures - I look to see is he in the background, is he somewhere? Are they searching for him? I'm just trying to find any clue that leads to him,"" she says. Mohamed is instantly recognisable - he wears large black glasses and is missing a leg. In 2018, he spent five months with Nadia and her husband Mike, in Dearborn, Michigan, to receive medical treatment. A local facility gave him a prosthetic leg. ""He's the cutest sweetest little kid,"" Mike says. ""I will always love him like a son."" They kept in touch after he returned home to Gaza, and last week the Ayoubs - who are Lebanese Muslims - received a WhatsApp message in which he said he was heading to Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the territory. ""Don't worry about me,"" he wrote. And since then, nothing. On a crisp autumn day, the couple joined dozens of people at an outdoor food truck market to fundraise for civilians in Gaza. They are angry with President Joe Biden over his strong support for Israel's actions in Gaza in the aftermath of the attacks by Hamas on 7 October. This has been made worse for them by the US vetoing a UN call for a ceasefire. Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people and took 241 hostages in the attack. Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which 10,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ""President Biden has blood on his hands,"" says Mike. ""He had my vote - he's lost it forever,"" Nadia adds. It's a sentiment that's widespread across the city, where more than half the population is of Arab heritage. The local Arab American News newspaper is blunt, accompanying a picture of the president with the headline: ""He lost our votes."" In a swing state like Michigan, the numbers will really matter in 2024. Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by 10,000 votes. President Biden took it back from him by about 154,000 votes in 2020. Given there are about 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan, to many it's clear that he needs their votes. But people in Dearborn feel betrayed, says local official Sam Baydoun. ""How can they vote for the president when they see these atrocities on live TV, and he is the one who is enabling this by sending more weapons?"" the county commissioner asks. President Biden's staunch support of Israel is not new, but Mr Baydoun says he is surprised the president visited Tel Aviv during a war and met the Israeli cabinet. A summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was cancelled after a strike on a hospital in Gaza. ""We need an immediate ceasefire. If the election was held today he would not get the Arab vote,"" Mr Baydoun says. The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, says that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%. That would be the first time in nearly 30 years that the Democrats were not the party of choice for Arab American voters. Mr Baydoun is a Democrat, and says the war has made his job tougher: ""How can I tell someone today to vote for President Biden?"" he asks. The dilemma for many in Dearborn is that the alternative is Donald Trump - an unpopular choice given he signed an executive order when in office that briefly barred travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. ""I'm not going to tell people to vote for Trump. Obviously, I will not vote for Trump,"" the commissioner says. Political analyst Larry Sabato says Mr Trump was in some ways a more pro-Israel president, infuriating Arab states by moving the capital to Jerusalem. But that could mean Arab Americans stay at home, even if that benefits Mr Trump, Mr Sabato says. New polling by Siena College for the New York Times suggests Mr Biden loses out to Mr Trump in swing states like Michigan on the question of who is more trusted to handle the Israel-Hamas conflict. Nada Al-Hanooti's job is to turn out the Muslim American vote in Michigan, and he can sense a change in mood. ""I'm hearing friends, and colleagues from other institutions that they're either voting third party or they're staying home."" Ms Al-Hanooti is executive director of Emgage, a civic engagement group that says it was instrumental in helping Mr Biden win Michigan in 2020. ""We made a lot of calls, sent a lot of text messages, did a lot of voter registration, as well as signing people up for absentee ballots. Biden needs the Muslim vote in order to win Michigan."" Now she says she doesn't know what Emgage's strategy will be for 2024. ""The president's job is to be the moral compass of the nation. And right now he's lost trust and credibility with a lot of the American public."" The election is about a year away - a lifetime in politics - will this feeling fade? ""We will not forget,"" Ms Al-Hanooti say. ""This is deep heartbreak."" Israel has described the attack by Hamas as ""our 9/11"". Many in Dearborn who remember the World Trade Center attacks say the aftermath for Arabs reminds them of that time. The fatal stabbing of a six-year old Palestinian boy in Illinois, days after the attack in Israel, has deepened that sense of unease. The boy's landlord is accused of attacking him and his mother because of their religion. In recent days, President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have launched the country's first national strategy to counter Islamophobia. Some in Dearborn have welcomed that but most want Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza - only then will he win back their support. For others, though, the damage is done no matter what he does. In a local coffee shop, Lexi Zeidan - who is Palestinian Christian - says she's even stopped calling Mr Biden the president. He had my vote in 2020 but no longer, she says. ""Why would I ever claim him to be a president - one that doesn't stand up for what's right, that doesn't stand up for a group of people that are defenceless."" The White House has said a ceasefire would enable Hamas to regroup and instead they want a pause in Israeli bombardment to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. This US stance is echoed by the UK, Canada and the European Union. Larry Sabato says it's easy to dismiss the anger clearly evident in Dearborn as heat of the moment, but the Middle East goes to the heart of Arab Americans' priorities as it does for many Jewish Americans. And while Mr Biden can't afford to lose Michigan, Mr Sabato points out that neither can he afford to lose the growing Jewish vote in other swing states like Arizona or Georgia. Nearly 1.1 million Muslim voters cast ballots in the 2020 election, and according to Pew Research, there are about 5.8 million Jews in the US. While data shows the Jewish vote is more diverse, with an increase in those voting for Republicans in 2020, polls suggest most back Democrats and are a base constituency for the party. There isn't any definitive poll so far that tells us how Jewish American voters feel about Biden's handling of the Middle East war but Mr Sabato thinks it will matter. ""A Democrat really has to do well with Jewish Americans and Arab Americans in order to win,"" he says. ""Honestly, the only way around it for Biden is for this war not to be on the front burner a year from now."" The creatures are venomous reptiles native to the south-western US, but their bites are rarely fatal. The unnamed woman is accused of raising funds for the Ukrainian army. The American man lured two US women off a trail near Germany's famous Neuschwanstein Castle last year. ""I know the justice system will prevail,"" he says - but the lottery claims to have posted his numbers in error. Inflation is down and ""vibes"" are up - but younger Americans especially remain sceptical after the pain of soaring prices. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,,The Moral and Strategic Calculus of Voting for Joe Biden to Defeat Trump — or Not,"ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DONALD TRUMP ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system’s regular offerings. And he focused on hate. To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies. Literally everything this man does is a racket. His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump’s predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “smarter” way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama’s policies killed a lot of innocent people. The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump’s military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term. Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates. The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at. Trump’s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly, babble incoherently, or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him. Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation. Demonstrators gather in front of the Colorado State Capitol building to protest coronavirus stay-at-home orders during a “ReOpen Colorado” rally in Denver, Colorado, on April 19, 2020. PERHAPS THE MOST devastating dimension of Trump’s time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP’s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day. The public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump’s running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man. With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they’ve cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers. Trump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he’s going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media. More broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump’s time in office is profound and terrifying. Out in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban — and in some ways has succeeded in banning — Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge? Trump’s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won’t openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in. Donald Trump’s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let’s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history. What would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers’ rights, civil rights, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus, and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly. IT IS IN contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden’s chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that “I’m not Trump” combined with Biden having been Obama’s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake. There is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump’s core belief that corruption isn’t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election’s integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities. Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden’s cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for, and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing. In numerous interactions with voters, Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner; told an immigrant rights activist to “vote for Trump”; called voters childish names; and threatened a union worker in Detroit, telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker “want[s] to go outside with me.” Let’s not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding “Corn Pop” at the pool. Trump’s temperament is frightening, but Biden isn’t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence. Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. “You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,” is not a good line. “Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency” — also not a winning zinger. And don’t think for a moment that Trump won’t hammer away on Biden’s Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election. There is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden’s career, his policy record, his mental stamina, or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination. All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months. The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden’s candidacy. Obama and other senior party leaders, major news organizations, and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality. Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot. Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men, the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden. What we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying. What we get with Biden, in his current form, is less apparent. Biden will have a team of competent (for better and worse) technocrats and, in all likelihood, an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show. Biden’s administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas. It will, without a doubt, also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish, corporatist Democratic apparatchiks. It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street, believes in bloated war budgets, and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire. It’s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can’t even bank on a return to Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way. Biden isn’t great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden’s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric. Biden’s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts. There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden’s record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration. The Obama-Biden administration’s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “deporter in chief,” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “big mistake.” At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama’s torrid pace of deportations. “Absolutely not,” he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden’s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn’t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process. Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can. Biden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “a pariah.” That’s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom’s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected. Former US Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden arrives to speak about COVID-19, known as the Coronavirus, during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware on March 12, 2020. Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don’t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don’t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “the team” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten. So what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office. It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, “I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, “I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.” None of these people’s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump. Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush. If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “bending the knee” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care. Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders’s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama’s troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden’s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden’s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes. In the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party’s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s. Unlike Ralph Nader’s independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party’s own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory. Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party’s primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters. The traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders. The war for the future of the Democratic Party is intensifying. There is a possibility of a fracture or at least more clearly defined factions within the party. There will be serious discussions around forming a new party that isn’t the Green Party, but rather an outgrowth of the “Not Me, Us” framework of the Sanders campaign and the growing popularity of groups like the Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, prison abolitionists, immigrant rights groups, and Democratic Socialists of America. It would be a great thing for this country to have a democratic socialist party grow, one that runs serious political campaigns. We have already seen early stage efforts at this with mixed results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez understands the need to engage in strategic partnerships with establishment Democrats to achieve meaningful policy change and strengthen the areas of common ground. But there will need to be a lot more like-minded politicians elected for the strategy to succeed. This primary has shaken the Democratic establishment to its core, and that is a good thing and should be built on. But none of that is going to happen before November. Some Sanders supporters who are deeply concerned by the candidacy of Biden have said he can have their vote but not their soul. For many people that will be their strategic rationale. For others, it will be a question of individual or collective morality in the face of Trump’s horrors. Leftist voters in swing states shoulder a greater moral burden than the rest of us, and many will decide to vote against Trump by pulling the lever for Biden. There are also very vocal opponents of Biden who are fed up and are flat out going to refuse to vote for him. They recognize that the opposite of Trump is not Biden. They want a society where free health care is a right and wars are ended, where everyone has housing and work that pays livable wages, where you don’t amass a mountain of debt to get an education, and one that treats immigrants and workers with dignity and defends a woman’s absolute right to choose. They want the racist justice system dismantled and ICE to be abolished. They believe we are in a climate emergency and that Biden is a part of the problem. Mainstream Democrats tell them they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don’t believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats’ cheap dates — treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted. If Democrats want to try to win them over, they should use the next six months to show them you take their concerns about 2016 seriously and map out the ways this campaign is different. Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump. For them, “He’s not Trump” is not a gamble worth taking. The onus is on the Biden campaign and its supporters to make their case to every eligible voter in this country and earn their votes. No one should be taken for granted.

,,Why Biden should be thankful it's not 2024 yet,"And what some other politicians might be feeling grateful for this week. Welcome to 538’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited. tia.yang (Tia Yang, editor/reporter): It’s Thanksgiving week, and the presidential turkeys have already been pardoned. Liberty and Bell, this year’s lucky birds from Minnesota, are surely thankful to be heading back home this holiday season. And with most politicians doing the same, here at 538, we thought we’d chat about what we think some of them might be feeling thankful for. We’ll start at the top with President Joe Biden, who just turned 81 on Monday. Maybe his birthday wish was for some better polling heading into 2024. But what does the president have to be thankful for this Thanksgiving? leah.askarinam (Leah Askarinam, politics reporter): That current horse-race polling isn't predictive. nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): Hahaha. leah.askarinam: Did I steal yours? nrakich: You didn't steal mine, but I was going to say, it's an awkward time to be asking what Biden should be thankful for, given the polling slump he’s in! His average approval rating has fallen below 40 percent in 538's tracker. There's a lot of dissatisfaction among his base about his handling of issues like the economy and the war in Israel-Gaza. And he trails former President Donald Trump in most general-election polls. leah.askarinam: Right. Recent polls have yielded some bad news for Biden — for example, his approval rating declined to his lowest ever in the latest NBC poll, which is widely respected among politicos. But even more interesting to me was how NBC summed up a slew of other record-breaking bad numbers that poll included for Biden. For example, it's the first time the poll found Biden behind Trump in a hypothetical general-election matchup. And one of the pollsters, Republican Bill McInturff, told NBC that the impact the Israel-Hamas war has had was unprecedented, because foreign affairs don't usually hit American presidents quite this hard. Perhaps Biden could be thankful that outlier polls exist and could potentially account for some of the bad numbers, although it seems unlikely given recent trends. nrakich: Yeah. But I think your first point is absolutely right, Leah — Biden can be thankful that this is November 2023, not November 2024. I'm skeptical that the Israel-Hamas war is going to stay in the headlines long enough to be one of the deciding issues of the 2024 general election. It's a long campaign. We're in a bad news cycle for Biden right now. But there is time for several more news cycles to come and go before Election Day. Including some news cycles that will probably be bad for Trump! And that's what I think Biden should be thankful for: the fact that he is very likely going to be running against Trump, who is almost as unpopular as he is, who may very well be convicted of multiple crimes in the next year, and who has a unique ability to energize the Democratic base. If you think the polls are bad for Biden against Trump, take a look at his polls against former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. A Fox News poll that put Biden 4 points behind Trump nationally put him 11 points behind Haley. A Marquette Law School poll that put Biden 2 points behind Trump nationally (among likely voters) put him 12 points behind Haley. Now, I don't think Haley would win by that much (no one has won the popular vote by more than 9 points since 1984). But I think if Republicans nominated anyone but Trump, they would be favorites to win back the White House in 2024. tia.yang: Plus the fact that Biden’s silver lining is that he’s running against someone almost as unpopular as he is only underlines the fact that he's less popular than Trump. Heading into the 2020 election, Trump was nearly as unpopular as he is now, but Biden's favorability was in positive territory. Now Biden is the unpopular incumbent. That could be bad news for him when it comes to turning out his base. leah.askarinam: Right, they're both quite unpopular. But I still think Trump has a harder ceiling than Biden, and the biggest threat to a Biden victory is voters staying at home or voting third-party. But to that point, I'd add to Biden's list of things to be thankful for that the off-year elections indicate that voters are still responding to messaging on protecting abortion rights. A new Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found a record-breaking share of Americans — 55 percent — say women should be able to get an abortion for any reason. tia.yang: Good point, Leah. A September NBC poll found that voters trust Democrats over Republicans on abortion (and health care) more than on any other issue, and we can expect them to continue emphasizing that issue to drive turnout. Let's move on to the other side of the horse race. Nathaniel, what do you think Trump's feeling thankful for? nrakich: Haha, my snarky answer is that Trump should be thankful for the fact that he'll probably run against Biden! The same things I said above for Biden go for Trump too: If Democrats had a younger, less unpopular nominee like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Sen. Raphael Warnock, Trump would be a serious underdog. But instead, Trump will probably run against one of the only politicians in America who’s more unpopular than he is. leah.askarinam: I think there's a slight unknown there though, Nathaniel. We know that Biden versus Trump is basically a dead heat at this point, because Biden's weaknesses are, theoretically, manageable for Democrats. He can still run on abortion rights and preserving democracy, even if voters think that as a human being he is simply too old to be president. He won't win a landslide, but he can certainly win the presidency anyway. To compare this to Biden’s odds against a more popular Republican, the only reason we know Haley fares well on a national stage is because ... she is running for president and is faring decently on a national stage. But we don't know how Whitmer or Warnock would fare on a national stage until we see one of them on it. nrakich: That's fair! tia.yang: That same Fox News poll that had Biden trailing Haley also found Trump leading Democratic alternatives like Whitmer and Vice President Kamala Harris in a theoretical matchup. But as Leah said, these matchups are more hypothetical than, say, Haley versus Biden. Leah, what about you? What else should Trump be thankful for? leah.askarinam: Trump should be thankful that the latest round of polling that declares Nikki Haley is ""surging"" in New Hampshire also means that she finally made it into the double digits. In other words, Trump should be thankful that he's so far ahead in the GOP primary polls! tia.yang: Right. While Haley's polling looks good in a theoretical matchup against Biden, it's not looking so good against Trump. A recent Harvard CAPS-Harris poll of registered Republican voters found her at 19 percent to Trump's 81 percent in a head-to-head primary race. nrakich: Yeah, my alternative answer was going to be that Trump should be thankful that Republican voters are still so loyal to him, even after he lost in 2020. Historically, parties usually want nothing to do with their losing presidential nominees — Democrats moved on quickly from Hillary Clinton after 2016, Republicans from Mitt Romney after 2012. But not Trump after 2020. Of course, maybe that's not too surprising when you consider that 69 percent of Republicans believe Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. tia.yang: Trump does hate losing, so he’s definitely thankful for that! Let’s pivot to the legislative branch. In the wake of a House speakership crisis and amid a looming government shutdown, public approval for Congress has been as low as 13 percent in recent polls — 538’s approval tracker had it at its lowest point all year at the end of October. But after 10 straight weeks in session, Speaker Mike Johnson’s House managed to avoid (or at least delay) a holiday season shutdown by punting the next federal funding deadline to January. What does Johnson have to be thankful for? leah.askarinam: I would say that Johnson should be thankful that he won enough votes to become speaker, which should indicate that it's not impossible to unite the GOP conference around a single issue. nrakich: Johnson should be thankful that everyone in Congress is tired and just wants to go home, haha. In order to keep the government open, Johnson had to compromise with Democrats and pass a continuing resolution. In other words, he had to do exactly what former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did. In both cases, the House Freedom Caucus was outraged — but while McCarthy famously lost his job for his transgressions, Johnson still has his. Someone could have very easily tried to file a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson too. But I think, after all the chaos in the House in October after McCarthy was ousted, the appetite just wasn't there for that. leah.askarinam: So, should Johnson be thankful that the right wing of the Republican Party ousted McCarthy? nrakich: I guess so, Leah? Assuming that being speaker of the House is actually something to be thankful for ... leah.askarinam: That is a leap indeed, Nathaniel. But I do think Johnson ended up being the right person at the right time, and that's something to be thankful for. nrakich: In all seriousness, though, the speakership seems to me like a thankless, nearly impossible job right now, given the slim majority Republicans are working with. Honestly, I think McCarthy should be thankful that he doesn't have to worry about it anymore. tia.yang: Yeah, to address Leah's first point about GOP unity, I'm skeptical anyone could unite the GOP conference around spending issues. It’s going to be an uphill battle for Johnson. Even before he got the funding extension passed, many were noting that the new speaker’s honeymoon period with conservatives seemed to have ended — and that seems even more true after he passed it. leah.askarinam: Right. Maybe Johnson should just be thankful for his friends and family, because work is going to be tough. tia.yang: To that point, I think all members of Congress are probably pretty thankful not only to be home for Thanksgiving, but for the absence of a government funding deadline right before Christmas or New Year’s, thanks to Johnson’s CR that extended current funding through Jan. 19 or Feb. 2. This is the first time in over a decade (since 2012) that Congress doesn’t have at least one government funding deadline in the month of December. Last year it passed an omnibus spending bill on Dec. 23, and in 2021, it set five different funding deadlines in December alone. So while he may have run out his rope with hardline conservatives, the fact that Johnson got this funding extension passed at all could do a lot to cool things down after a particularly testy November in Congress. He’s the speaker who saved Christmas! On brand for him. nrakich: Yeah, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is not a Christmas movie! leah.askarinam: So, if Johnson saves Christmas, who's the grinch? tia.yang: Chip Roy would love to declare himself the grinch. But seriously, the Freedom Caucus and anti-establishment wing that ousted McCarthy over cutting that initial spending deal stands ready to be the grinch in this scenario. As Nathaniel noted, they gave Johnson a pass this time, but they’re not happy that he extended funding at fiscal 2023 levels, which were set by Democrats back in 2022. What about elsewhere in Congress? What other Thanksgiving hot takes do you guys have? leah.askarinam: Well, since you asked: I think the first-term Republican congressmen from New York who are facing tough elections in November 2024 are thankful for the House Ethics Committee report that alleged “substantial evidence” that Rep. George Santos paid for personal expenses with campaign funds. Santos announced he won't seek reelection, but he faces a major threat before that, with a resolution to expel him from Congress expected to come to the floor after Thanksgiving. I think some Suffolk County and New York Republican Party leaders will be thankful, too. Santos's antics in Congress just weren't a good look while other New York Republicans are making the case to voters that, despite the ""R"" next to their name, they're common-sense politicians who can represent Biden voters' interests. Santos, meanwhile, will still allegedly have some things to be thankful for, including, according to the House Ethics report, what should be truly fantastic skin, made possible by spa visits and Botox. nrakich: Haha. Santos should be thankful that he still has his job — at least for now. Ahead of the expected vote on whether to expel him next week, I guess Santos should also be thankful that it requires a two-thirds vote to expel a member and that only five representatives in history have ever been expelled. leah.askarinam: And he already survived another resolution to expel him recently! It's not over! tia.yang: It says a lot about how bad a look Santos has been for New York Republicans that they were the ones leading that initial charge to oust him — right after the GOP speaker battle emphasized how much every Republican vote counts with such a small majority. Nathaniel, what's your parting Thanksgiving hot take? nrakich: I think this is a pretty cold take, but Mitch McConnell should be thankful for the 2024 Senate map. Needing just one or two flips to take control of the Senate (depending on who wins the vice presidency), Republicans have three great pickup opportunities in states that Trump carried by at least 8 points in 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. McConnell should be extra thankful that Joe Manchin, the Democratic incumbent in West Virginia, decided not to run for reelection, which virtually assures that Republicans will pick up that seat. Sorry, that was not nearly as fun as Leah's. leah.askarinam: I think McConnell should be thankful for his position in general — he gets to be the grown-up in the room next door to a chaotic House conference, and he doesn’t have run for reelection himself in 2024, since his term ends in 2026. And, I think there might be a long list of Republicans who would be thankful for a Joe Manchin presidential run! He’s openly considering one, lamenting that Biden has gone “too far left.” tia.yang: Manchin going from Senate kingmaker to presidential election spoiler would be a maximally chaotic power move from him. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948,,
,,Opinion President Biden should not run again in 2024,                ,www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/12/biden-trump-election-step-aside/,,
,,A deepfake ‘Joe Biden’ robocall told voters to stay home for primary election,"An AI vocal clone confused New Hampshire residents ahead of first-in-the-nation primary. BY ANDREW PAUL | PUBLISHED JAN 22, 2024 3:56 PM EST AI vocal cloning technology is reportedly already muddying the waters ahead of the 2024 election. According to a statement issued by the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday, a robocall campaign deployed over the weekend used an imitation of President Joe Biden’s voice to urge recipients not to vote in the state’s January 23 presidential primary. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” an AI-generated Biden told residents over the phone. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” The disinformation campaign’s orchestrators are currently unknown, but it comes from “obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden,” according to former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan, speaking through NBC News’ initial exclusive report. [Related: Deepfake audio already fools people nearly 25 percent of the time.] AI-generated content including deepfaked audio, video, and imagery is a growing concern among misinformation experts. Multiple reports have warned that today’s media, internet, and social landscapes are unprepared for a likely imminent deluge of falsified “fake news” content as the 2024 presidential election intensifies. A recent study conducted by researchers at the UK’s University College London indicates AI generated audio can fool as many as 1-in-4 listeners. Over 1,600 videos uploaded to YouTube have featured deepfaked celebrities like Taylor Swift and Steve Harvey hawking “medical card” schemes and other scams, collectively amassing over 195 million views in the process. But unlike “free money” ploys from AI Oprah, the latest vocal cloning example is explicitly meant to influence the US political landscape. As for this weekend’s misinfo campaign, the fake Biden falsely claimed an ongoing statewide campaign to write-in his name during New Hampshire’s primary would hurt the president’s reelection prospects. The robocall message then concluded with a phone number linked to Kathy Sullivan, resulting in a flurry of calls on Sunday evening that prompted the former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair to report the situation to the state attorney general’s office. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters,” the state attorney general’s office cautioned in Monday’s statement. Voters were urged to disregard the message, with the office explicitly making clear, “Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election.” [Related: Beware the AI celebrity clones peddling bogus ‘free money’ on YouTube.] Representatives of former President Trump’s campaign have denied any connection to the robocall scheme. Meanwhile a spokesperson for Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota challenging Biden for the Democratic Party nomination, described the scam as “wildly concerning.” “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Phillips campaign representative Katie Dolan told NBC News. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.” At least some Phillips supporters, however, are embracing other AI tool tactics, despite warnings to the contrary. Late last week, The Washington Post noted that Dean.Bot—a chatbot created by a pro-Phillips SuperPAC—had been removed from OpenAI’s recently launched online store for “knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning.” Despite the slap on the wrist, Phillips remains a favorite of some Silicon Valley’s top players. The SuperPAC behind Dean.Bot, We Deserve Better, was co-founded by the former chief of staff for Sam Altman, OpenAI co-founder and recently fired-and-rehired CEO. Altman himself has met with Phillips, although he has yet to endorse or formally donate to the congressman’s campaign. The New Hampshire AG’s statement notes a Department of Justice investigation into the AI presidential robocall is ongoing, and encourages residents to contact the Election Law Unit if they received a message beginning with AI Biden opining, “What a bunch of malarkey.” Andrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.

,,Behind Biden’s 2020 Victory,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  Note (July 2023): A new report about the 2022 validated voters used slightly revised 2020 estimates. There was nothing inaccurate about the 2020 results, but we chose to use a slightly different survey weighting approach that increases the precision of our estimates. None of the substantive findings from the 2020 report have been impacted. See the 2022 methodology for more detail.    The 2020 presidential election was historic in many ways. Amid a global pandemic, with unprecedented changes in how Americans voted, voter turnout rose 7 percentage points over 2016, resulting in a total of 66% of U.S. adult citizens casting a ballot in the 2020 election. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote. While Biden’s popular vote differential was an improvement over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 2-point advantage, it was not as resounding as congressional Democrats’ 9-point advantage over Republicans in votes cast in the 2018 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel were matched to public voting records from three national commercial voter files in an attempt to find a record for voting in the 2020 election. Validated voters are citizens who told us in a post-election survey that they voted in the 2020 general election and have a record for voting in a commercial voter file. Nonvoters are citizens who were not found to have a record of voting in any of the voter files or told us they did not vote. A new analysis of validated 2020 voters from Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel examines change and continuity in the electorate, both of which contributed to Biden’s victory. It looks at how new voters and voters who turned out in one or both previous elections voted in the 2020 presidential election and offers a detailed portrait of the demographic composition and vote choices of the 2020 electorate. It also provides a comparison with findings from our previous studies of the 2016 and 2018 electorates. A number of factors determined the composition of the 2020 electorate and explain how it delivered Biden a victory. Among those who voted for Clinton and Trump in 2016, similar shares of each – about nine-in-ten – also turned out in 2020, and the vast majority remained loyal to the same party in the 2020 presidential contest. These voters formed substantial bases of support for both Biden and Trump. Overall, there were shifts in presidential candidate support among some key groups between 2016 and 2020, notably suburban voters and independents. On balance, these shifts helped Biden a little more than Trump. Overall, one-in-four 2020 voters (25%) had not voted in 2016. About a quarter of these (6% of all 2020 voters) showed up two years later – in 2018 – to cast ballots in the highest-turnout midterm election in decades. Those who voted in 2018 but not in 2016 backed Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by about two-to-one (62% to 36%). Both Trump and Biden were able to bring new voters into the political process in 2020. The 19% of 2020 voters who did not vote in 2016 or 2018 split roughly evenly between the two candidates (49% Biden vs. 47% Trump). However, as with voters overall, there was a substantial age divide within this group. Among those under age 30 who voted in 2020 but not in either of the two previous elections, Biden led 59% to 33%, while Trump won among new or irregular voters ages 30 and older by 55% to 42%. Younger voters also made up an outsize share of these voters: Those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular 2020 voters, though they represented just 15% of all 2020 voters. One somewhat unusual aspect of the 2016 election was the relatively high share of voters (nearly 6%) who voted for one of the third-party candidates (mostly the Libertarian and Green Party nominees), a fact many observers attributed to the relative unpopularity of both major party candidates. By comparison, just 2% of voters chose a third-party candidate in 2020. Overall, third-party 2016 voters who turned out in 2020 voted 53%-36% for Biden over Trump, with 10% opting for a third-party candidate. Among the 5% of Republicans who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, a majority (70%) supported Trump in 2020, but 18% backed Biden. Among the 5% of Democrats who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, just 8% supported Trump in 2020 while 85% voted for Biden. Here are some of the other key findings from the analysis: This analysis is based on a survey of 11,818 members of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel conducted Nov. 12-17, 2020, shortly after the general election. It also draws on surveys conducted among 10,640 panelists from Nov. 7-16, 2018, after the midterm election that year and 4,183 panelists from Nov. 29 to Dec. 12, 2016, after the general election. Researchers attempted to match the panelists to three different commercial voter files that contain official records of voter registration and turnout for 2016, 2018 and 2020. (For more details, see Methodology.) This study marries official turnout records with a post-election survey among a large, ongoing survey panel, with the goal of improving the accuracy of the results compared with relying on self-reported turnout alone. The survey panel also makes it possible to examine change in turnout and vote preference over time among many of the same individuals. This analysis joins a growing body of research seeking to achieve a more accurate assessment of the 2020 election, each based on somewhat different sources of data.2 Different methods and data sources have unique strengths and weaknesses, meaning that specific estimates are likely to vary among the studies and no single resource can be considered definitive. The 2020 election featured continuity in the voting patterns of major demographic and political groups in the population, but there were a few important shifts. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 as Democrats made gains among men and Republicans made gains among women. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won men by 11 percentage points (52% to 41%) while Hillary Clinton won women by 15 points (54% to 39%). In the 2018 election, Democrats substantially narrowed the gap with men (50% of men voted for Democratic candidates, 48% for Republican candidates) while maintaining an 18-point lead among women. In the 2020 election, men again divided nearly evenly (50% Trump, 48% Biden), while Biden’s advantage narrowed to 11 points among women (55% to 44%). Similarly, as Biden increased his level of support among White men in the 2020 election relative to Clinton’s in 2016, Trump gained among White women, which had the effect of further narrowing the gender gap among White voters. In 2016, Trump won White men by 30 points (62% to 32%). That gap narrowed to a 17-point margin for Trump in 2020 (57% to 40%). White women, a group sometimes categorized as swing voters and who broke nearly evenly in 2016 (47% for Trump to 45% for Clinton), favored him in 2020 (53% to 46%). Biden received the support of 92% of Black voters, nearly the same as Clinton received in 2016 and Democratic candidates for the U.S. House received in 2018. While Biden took a 59% majority of the Hispanic vote, Trump (with 38%) gained significantly over the level of support Republican candidates for the House received in 2018 (25%). To be sure, Hispanic voters are not a monolith; there is substantial diversity within the Hispanic electorate. One noteworthy feature of the 2020 election was the wide education gap among Hispanic voters. In 2020, Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30%. At the same time, Biden’s advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters who did not have a college degree was far narrower (55% to 41%). One of the most pivotal groups in the 2016 election was White voters without a four-year college degree, who were critical to Trump’s electoral college victory that year (nationally, he won them by a wide 36-point margin in 2016, 64% to 28%). Prior to 2016, differences in candidate preferences by education were typically much smaller than they were that year. In 2020, Trump won 65% of White non-college voters – nearly identical to his 2016 share – even as Biden outperformed Clinton among this group (33% of White non-college voters backed Biden, up from the 28% of this group Clinton won in 2016). At the same time, White voters with a college degree or higher supported Biden by roughly the same margin they had backed Clinton in 2016. Trump’s stronghold among White men without a four-year college degree loosened somewhat in 2020. While he still won this group by a little more than two-to one (66% to Biden’s 31%), that 35 percentage point gap is notably smaller than the 50-point gap in the 2016 election, when 73% of White men without a college degree supported Trump, compared with 23% who supported Clinton. Meanwhile, White men with a four-year college degree have become increasingly supportive of Democratic candidates, breaking close to evenly in 2016 (47% for Clinton, 44% for Trump) but supporting Biden by a 10-point margin in 2020. At the same time, Trump’s vote share among White women without a college degree grew slightly between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. In 2016, White, non-college women supported Trump by a margin of 56% to 33%. By 2020, Trump’s vote share rose to 64% among this group compared with 35% supporting Biden. Among white women with a college degree, support for Biden was on par with support for Clinton in 2016 (59%-40% in 2020). Biden and Trump benefited from similar levels of party loyalty in 2020, with Trump receiving 92% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Biden getting 94% among Democrats and Democratic leaners. Comparable levels of support for each candidate were seen among Democrats (95% for Biden) and Republicans (94% for Trump), not including leaners. Among independents and those who affiliated with other parties, Biden led Trump by 52%-43%. Ideological divisions within the parties were also apparent in the vote, with both Trump and Biden doing better among the ideological core of their parties. Trump received the votes of 97% of conservative Republicans and leaners but a smaller majority (79%) of Republicans who describe themselves as moderate or liberal. Biden took 98% of the vote among liberal Democrats and leaners and 91% among those who are moderate or conservative. A yawning age gap in voter support – a pattern that emerged in the 2004 presidential election for the first time since 1972 – continues to be evident, with voters under 30 favoring Joe Biden by 24 percentage points (Biden 59%, Trump 35%). Perhaps reflecting the enduring impact of this long-term age gap, voters ages 30 to 49 were also solidly in the Democratic candidate’s camp in 2020, favoring Biden by 12 points (55%-43%), similar to Clinton’s share among this age group. By contrast, older age groups divided fairly evenly between Biden and Trump, a result not too different from 2016. These patterns also are apparent when the lens is shifted to birth cohorts, or generations – groups of voters who share birth years and perhaps formative political experiences in common, such as the popularity of the president at the time they were first eligible to vote. Voters in the youngest adult generations today – Generation Z (those ages 18 to 23 in 2020) and the Millennial generation (ages 24 to 39 in 2020) – favored Biden over Trump by a margin of 20 percentage points, though Trump gained 8 points among Millennials compared with his 2016 performance. Generation Xers, those ages 40 to 55 in 2020, divided relatively evenly (51% to 48%), as did Baby Boomers. Only among members of the Silent Generation, ages 75 to 92 in 2020, was Trump clearly favored (by 58%-42%). Notably, Boomers and Silents (and the very small number of voters from the Greatest Generation) made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%), compared with just over half in both 2016 and 2018. The political split between America’s rural areas and its suburban and urban locales remained substantial in 2020. Biden did considerably better among suburban voters in 2020 than Clinton did in 2016 (54% for Biden, 45% for Clinton). By contrast, Trump garnered the support of 65% of rural voters, including 71% of White rural voters; the latter represented an increase over the 62% he received among this group in 2016. Biden received a solid majority of votes among urban residents (66% overall), but Trump gained among urbanites relative to his performance in 2016 (33% in 2020, 24% in 2016). Voters in 2020 sorted along religious lines in ways consistent with recent elections. Protestants constituted nearly half of all voters (46%), as they did in 2016. Within the Protestant tradition, White evangelicals accounted for 19% of all voters, but a much higher share of Trump’s voters (34%). Without such broad support for Trump among White evangelicals, Biden would have beaten him by more than 20 points. White non-evangelical Protestants voted for Trump over Biden by a 14-point margin (57%-43%), while Black Protestants were an overwhelmingly Democratic group (91% voted for Biden). Biden, by contrast, drew strong support from religiously unaffiliated voters – atheists, agnostics, and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular.” Together, these voters made up 25% of voters, which is a slightly larger share of the total electorate than White evangelicals (19%). But support for Biden among the unaffiliated was not quite as lopsided as Trump’s support among White evangelicals (a 45-point margin for Biden among the unaffiliated vs. a 69-point margin for Trump among White evangelicals). Without the religiously unaffiliated, Trump would have had a 9-point popular vote margin over Biden. White non-Hispanic Catholics were more supportive of Biden (at 42%) than they had been of Clinton in 2016 (31%), but Trump still captured a solid majority of their votes (57%). White Catholics made up 14% of all voters. As was the case in the 2016 and 2018 elections, the Democratic voting coalition in 2020 looked quite different from the Republican coalition in several respects. Overall, Biden voters were younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and less likely to live in rural areas than Trump voters. In 2020, 85% of voters who cast a ballot for Trump were White non-Hispanic; this compares with just 61% of Biden voters. These differences are roughly consistent with the share of White voters in each party’s coalition in 2016. Nearly two-in-ten voters who cast a ballot for Biden in the 2020 election (19%) were Black, identical to the share of Clinton voters in 2016 who were Black. That is significantly higher than the share of Trump voters who were Black (2%). The community profiles of Trump and Biden voters are similar in some fundamental ways to the previous two elections – but more voters who cast ballots for Biden in 2020 say they live in a suburban area compared with Clinton’s 2016 voters. Overall, urban voters continue to constitute a larger share of the Democratic coalition compared with the Republican coalition. And rural voters remain a significantly larger portion of the Republican electorate. However, when comparing Clinton’s voters with Biden’s, there are some significant shifts. In 2016, about half of Clinton’s voters described their communities as suburban (48%), while 32% said they were from an urban area and 19% were from a rural area. In 2020, suburban voters made up a majority of Biden’s coalition (55%); 28% of his voters said they lived in urban areas and 17% were from rural areas. In 2020, 31% of Trump voters had at least a four-year college degree – similar to the share of Trump voters who had a college degree in 2016. Far more Trump voters (roughly 70% in each presidential election) did not have a four-year college degree. The Democratic electorate is more evenly divided when it comes to education. In 2020, 46% of Biden voters had at least a college degree; 53% did not have a degree. As was the case in 2016, White voters without a four-year college degree made up a considerably larger share of GOP voters (58%) than Democratic voters (27%). At the same time, White voters with a college degree made up a larger share of Biden voters (34%) than Trump voters (27%). In 2020, the age profiles of Democratic and Republican voters looked largely similar to 2016. Younger adults continue to make up a larger share of Democratic voters compared with Republican voters. For example, in 2020, nearly half of Biden voters (49%) were younger than 50; that compares with 39% of Trump voters in 2020. Protestants made up a majority of those voting Republican in 2020, just as they did in 2016. Overall, 58% of Trump voters were Protestant, compared with just 35% of Biden voters. White evangelical Protestants, in particular, remained a critical part of the Republican voting coalition, making up 34% of Trump’s voters but just 6% of Biden’s. Catholics made up similar shares of Biden and Trump voters (19% and 22%, respectively); in 2016, Catholics made up a slightly higher share of Trump voters compared with Clinton voters (23% vs. 18%). Voters who were unaffiliated with any religious tradition (atheists, agnostics and those who describe themselves as “nothing in particular”) made up 35% of Biden voters but just 14% of Trump voters in 2020. The 2020 election brought a huge change in howAmericans cast their ballots. As some states looked to adapt to challenges in administering elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters were offered expanded access to absentee and vote-by-mail options in the 2020 election. As a result, a record number of voters said they cast their ballots this way (46%). And smaller shares of voters said they either voted in person on Election Day (27%) or in person before Election Day (27%). A majority of absentee voters said they had previously voted this way before the 2020 election (56%). Still, a sizable share (43%) said the November election was the first time they had cast an absentee or mail ballot. Sizable shares of voters across racial and ethnic subgroups cast absentee or mail-in ballots in the 2020 election – though there are some differences in voting methods when comparing across groups. White voters were most likely to say they voted in person on Election Day (30%). Comparably smaller shares of Black (20%) and Hispanic voters (18%) said the same. Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to say they cast their ballot in person before Election Day (42% of Black voters, vs. 27% of Hispanic voters and 25% of White voters). Voters ages 65 and older stand out in their voting behavior: 55% say they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election – 13 percentage points higher than the share of adults under 65 who cast a ballot by mail. Urban and suburban voters were considerably more likely than rural voters to say they cast their ballot by mail (50% of urban and suburban vs. 35% of rural voters). In contrast, rural voters were more likely to report voting in person on Election Day. A majority of Biden voters said they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election (58%). By contrast, about a third of Trump voters (32%) voted by mail. Roughly two-thirds of Trump voters (68%) said they voted in person, either on (38%) or before (30%) Election Day.  Reflecting these differences, Trump performed much better among voters who cast their ballots in person on Election Day (65% for Trump vs. 33% for Biden). These shares were reversed among absentee and mail-in voters: 65% of absentee voters said they voted for Biden, compared with 33% who voted for Trump. Preferences were more evenly divided among those who cast their ballots in person ahead of Election Day: 52% voted for Trump while 47% voted for Biden. The 2020 general election featured the highest rate of voter turnout in more than a century, with 66% of eligible adults casting a ballot for president. All members of the American Trends Panel who took the 2020 post-election survey – whether they voted or not – were asked which candidate they preferred in the race for president. Nonvoters – citizens for whom no record of turnout could be located or who told us they did not vote – preferred Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 15 percentage points, 50% to 35%, compared with Biden’s 4-point overall advantage among voters. Voters were nearly evenly divided on party affiliation, with 50% identifying or leaning Democratic and 48% identifying or leaning Republican, similar to the 51%-48% split in 2016. Nonvoters in 2020 were more closely divided on partisanship than they were in 2016. Among nonvoters in 2020, 46% were Democrats or leaned Democratic, while 41% were Republicans or leaned Republican. A majority of nonvoters in 2016 (55%) were Democrats or Democratic leaners, compared with about four-in-ten (41%) who were Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Despite notable changes in the demographics of the two candidates’ coalitions, the demographic composition of the electorate as a whole in 2020 did not differ much from that of 2016. Although turnout was strong, stark demographic differences between voters and nonvoters similar to those seen in past U.S. elections were present in 2020, a pattern familiar to political observers. Voters as a group were considerably older than nonvoters. Adults younger than 50 made up 45% of all voters but 68% of nonvoters – nearly identical to the pattern seen in 2016. But generational change in the electorate was quite apparent. Very few members of Gen Z (born 1997 and later) were eligible to vote in the 2016 electorate, and they made up just 1% of all voters that year. In 2020, they were 8% of the total, though their lower rate of turnout compared with older age cohorts is reflected in the fact that they were 15% of eligible nonvoters. At the other end of the generational spectrum, members of the Silent and Greatest generations (born 1945 and earlier) fell from 16% of all voters in 2016 to just 8% in 2020, but their turnout rates remained among the highest of all generations.  Turnout differences by race and ethnicity persisted as well. White non-Hispanic adults were 72% of voters in 2020 but just 55% of nonvoting citizens. Black Americans made up 11% of voters, but a slightly larger share (14%) of nonvoting citizens, and Hispanic adults were 10% of voters but 20% of nonvoting citizens. Asian Americans (a relatively small but fast-growing group in the U.S.) made up 4% of voters and an identical share of nonvoting citizens (note: nonvoters in this analysis do not include noncitizens). Some of the largest differences between voters and nonvoters are seen on education and income. College graduates made up 39% of all voters in 2020 (about the same as in 2016) but only 17% of nonvoters. Adults with a high school education or less were 29% of all voters but half of nonvoters.

,,"Tlaib, only Pales­tinian American in Congress, urges Michigan Democrats to vote against Biden in primary","       Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, urged Democrats in her state to vote against President Joe Biden in the Feb. 27 primary, citing his support of Israel as they wage war with Hamas in Gaza. She urged her fellow Democrats to instead vote “uncommitted” to protest the president in a video posted over the weekend by Listen to Michigan, a campaign run by her sister opposing “war and genocide in Gaza.” More than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Wednesday. The war began when 1,200 were killed and 250 were taken hostage during an Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. “This is the way you can raise our voices. Don't make us even more invisible. Right now we feel completely neglected and just unseen by our government,” Tlaib said outside a civic center in Dearborn, Mich., on Saturday. Over half of the city’s 110,000 people are of Arab descent, according to the U.S. Census. “If you want us to be louder, then come here and vote ‘uncommitted.’” Michigan’s primary is not until the end of the month, but early voting began on Saturday and runs through Feb. 25. On the Democratic ballot, Biden faces only Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, whose campaign has floundered, and spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson, who has dropped out. The president has cruised through the handful of primary contests so far, with little expected to disrupt his path to the nomination. But the call to vote “uncommitted,” an option in Michigan, comes as Biden faces criticism from some corners of his own party, including Muslim and Arab Americans, that his Israel policy is failing to reign in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his bombardment of Gaza. The Biden administration has pushed back on Israel’s planned ground attack on Rafah, a city in Gaza’s south where around 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have congregated as 80% of their homes have been destroyed, according to U.N. officials Despite a growing public gap between Biden and Netanyahu, the president is pushing for billions in military aid for Israel, as well as funds for humanitarian assistance in Gaza. For Tlaib and others who share her views, including antiwar protestors who have disrupted speeches by the president and other politicians across the country in recent months, continuing to enable and support Israel’s war effort is tantamount to assisting genocide. “As important, as you all know, to not only march against the genocide, not only make sure that we're calling our members of Congress and local electeds and patting passing city resolutions, all throughout our country, it is also important to create a voting bloc, something that is a bullhorn to say, enough is enough,” Tlaib said on Saturday. “We don't want a country that supports wars and bombs and destruction. We want to support life. We want to stand up for every single life killed in Gaza.” Tlaib is not alone among prominent Michigan Democrats who have backed the “uncommitted” campaign. Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, former Michigan Rep. Andy Levin and a slew of state and local officials have all signed on to vote “uncommitted.” Our Revolution, the political organization founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016, I-Vt., has also endorsed the campaign, along with a Detroit chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. Sanders himself has declined to describe the conflict as a genocide and remains a vocal supporter of Biden. The Listen to Michigan website notes Trump won the state by just 10,000 votes in 2016. Biden won by around 154,000 votes in 2020. “Don't stay home, come out and tell the president you're mad at him,” Levin said on MSNBC’s “Ayman” on Sunday. “There's eight months left or something like that until Nov. 5, let's send a message to the president, that if you change course, which you must do for for justice, then I think that people will return to him” Hammoud and other local Arab-American leaders canceled a meeting with Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez in January over his disagreement with the president’s policies. Earlier this month, he instead met with members of the administration. “I firmly believe that it’s always the right time to do the right thing. And in this moment the right thing here is calling for a cease-fire, it’s restricting military aid and support to Benjamin Netanyahu and the most right-wing government in Israel’s history,” Hammoud said on Al Jazeera English’s “UpFront” last week. “I think these are tangible steps that can be taken to demonstrate good faith to a community in which you want to build support for the upcoming election. I think anything else is unacceptable.” “Donald Trump is a threat to American democracy. I recognize this. Many in the community recognize this in the upcoming election,” he continued, asking what will Biden do “to prevent the unraveling of this American democracy and why is the alignment with Benjamin Netanyahu potentially worth sacrificing that democracy. Earlier this month, the mayor announced an increased police presence at places of worship and “major infrastructure” after an influx of “bigoted and Islamaphobic rhetoric online targeting the city.” Hammoud blamed the attacks on a Wall Street Journal op-ed dubbing the city “America’s Jihad Capital.” Other major Michigan Democrats are backing the president, including the popular Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and both of the state’s senators, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters. But an AP-NORC poll from earlier this month showed two-thirds of U.S. adults and a majority of Democrats disapprove of Biden’s handling of the war, his lowest marks since it began. After running roughly even with former President Donald Trump in Michigan polls in the fall, Biden has consistently found himself down against his 2020 rival in general election polls there over the last couple months. Tlaib, one of the first two Muslim congresswomen in U.S. history, represents Dearborn and other communities in and around Detroit with large populations of Muslim and Arab Americans. Members of those communities in Michigan and in key swing states throughout the country have organized “Abandon Biden” efforts to foil the president’s reelection bid, not out of support for Trump, but to push Democrats to change their positions on Israel and the war in Gaza. Tlaib has not publicly endorsed the campaign. “President Biden has sent thousands of bombs to Israel’s military, while blocking international efforts to stop the violence and watering down attempts to secure sufficient humanitarian aid,” Tlaib wrote in a Feb. 14 email for the progressive group Justice Democrats, calling for signatures to petition demanding Biden “facilitate an immediate ceasefire” and affirm the U.N.’s International Court of Justice order last month that Israel do all it can to prevent death and acts of genocide.  “As the biggest funder of Israel’s military, U.S. government leaders have the power and the obligation to stop this unfolding genocide,” she added in the email. On Monday, the Biden administration countered an Algerian resolution at the U.N. that would call for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire with a proposal of their own, according to the Associated Press: a temporary, six-week cease-fire deal enacted “as soon as practicable” and dependent on Hamas’ release of some 130 of their remaining hostages, many of which are presumed dead. It would also condemn the planned offensive on Gaza and warn against the displacement of civilians into other countries like Egypt. A vote on the Algerian resolution, backed by 22 Arab nations and many other nations, is expected Tuesday morning. Beyond the U.N., negotiations between the U.S., Israel, Qatar and Egypt have not been fruitful in recent weeks, according to negotiators. The “uncommitted” effort in Michigan is not the first time Tlaib has condemned Biden for his policies, writing he “supported the genocide of the Palestinian people” in a video she posted on social media on Nov. 3, 2023. She’s remained a consistent critic and opponent of the president’s agenda since. “Biden, support a ceasefire now,” a caption on the video read. “Or don’t count on us in 2024.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

,,South Carolina Democratic primary: Are black voters losing faith in Joe Biden?,"Black voters were a key part of the coalition that helped Joe Biden win the White House, and he will need their overwhelming support to do it again. In South Carolina, however, many are frustrated with the president - and some are backing Donald Trump. A 40-minute drive from the sparkle and polish of Columbia, South Carolina, is the town of Winnsboro, which lacks both. It's a place Nocola Hemphill calls home - a home which, as she describes it, sounds like it's a world away from the state capital. Empty streets, abandoned businesses and vacant homes. Joblessness. Hopelessness. It's been that way for years, she says. ""There's no one reaching down here to lift anyone up. You have to wonder, does anyone really care?"" The 47-year-old is the CEO of the US Black Women's Chamber of Commerce, an organisation supporting small business development for black women across the country, an effort she says hasn't been noticeably aided by the Biden administration. ""I voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but I'm still waiting,"" Hemphill says. ""I'm still waiting on tangible change for my vote - for my people."" Just a few days before the Democratic primary election in her state - the first contest in the process to formally pick the party's presidential candidate - she wasn't sure if he still had her vote. And she's not alone. A recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Other surveys suggest black voters are warming to Donald Trump, the current Republican frontrunner and President Biden's likely November opponent. These are votes the president cannot afford to lose. His 2020 win over Mr Trump was in part driven by black voters. They helped him win in critical swing states, including Georgia, where a historic black voter turnout made Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1992. Todd Shaw, a University of South Carolina political science professor, told the BBC that if Mr Biden fails to get a strong showing from black voters from the state in Saturday's primary, it could spell trouble for his campaign for re-election.""Black voters in South Carolina mirror trends among black voters nationally. So, what happens here could be an indicator of what's to come."" President Biden pushed hard to change his party's rules so that South Carolina is the first state to vote in the nomination process. A Biden campaign adviser told the BBC the move was intended ""to make sure the process reflected the diversity of our party"". Over a quarter of South Carolina's population is black. And it was South Carolina's black voters who saved Biden's lacklustre bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 by handing him his first win. ""You're the reason I'm president,"" Mr Biden told a mostly black crowd in the state one evening in January. ""You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser, and you're the reason we're gonna win and beat him again."" It was one of several stops Mr Biden and his supporters have made in South Carolina this year, smiling for cameras at historically black colleges, shaking hands at barbershops, all the while, reminding voters of the ""record achievements"" his administration has made in their communities. The BBC spoke to lots of voters in the state who do support the president - and he's expected to win the primary comfortably. For many South Carolina black voters, however, the president's words feel disconnected from their realities. Kenard Holmes, a junior at South Carolina State University (SCSU), told the BBC he was not excited by Mr Biden's campaign. ""I know I'm going to vote. I'm just not sure who I'm voting for."" The 20-year-old remains unconvinced of the historic investments the White House says it has made into black colleges like his. In the university building where Holmes meets weekly with his gospel choir, he says conditions are ""embarrassing"". ""If it's cold outside, it's cold in there. If it's hot outside, it's hot in there,"" Holmes says. ""It's been like that for years."" Data shows that other black voters in South Carolina have similar reasons to be disenchanted. In 2022, eight of the state's top 10 counties with the highest poverty rates were majority black - averaging over 27%. And in more bustling areas like Charleston, US census data shows poverty rates were nearly twice as high in one of the city's majority-black neighbourhoods compared to its majority-white county. Although the state is run by Republicans, there is a sense the president could have done more. Matthew Guah, the dean of SCSU's business school, agrees that although money has been invested into black communities, it hasn't been substantive enough to move the needle. ""Record investment just means more than before. Record investment doesn't mean they got everything they need,"" he says. Ronnie Bennett, co-owner of the Broughton Street Cafe in Orangeburg County, told the BBC: ""If Biden has put money into black communities, I don't see it."" Ms Bennett plans to vote for Joe Biden again but mostly out of obligation, feeling Democrats offer her the most hope. ""Our ancestors fought for the right to vote, so we exercise that right whether we like who's running or not,"" she says. Her shop is located in Orangeburg's downtown historic district, less than a mile away from SCSU. Deserted sidewalks, boarded windows and crumbling buildings hug the downtown streets, save for a scant number of new businesses like Bennett's. The cafe's freshly painted exterior and colourful wood-warmed interior injected vibrancy into the neighbourhood when it opened in 2022, but little has come after, Bennett says. Others are eager to support Mr Biden, alarmed by the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Cecil Williams is the owner of the South Carolina Civil Rights Museum, where relics from one of the darkest chapters in American history are showcased. Inside, an original copy of The Clansman - the early 20th Century novel glamourising the Ku Klux Klan - sits just feet away from emptied shotgun shells used by police to kill unarmed black student protestors on SCSU's campus. The museum's artefacts are relics of a racist past that Williams fears Donald Trump is rekindling. The former president has faced accusations of racism - which he denies - including for pushing the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in America and for telling four minority congresswoman to ""go back"" to where they came from. ""We need someone like Joe Biden in the White House now more than ever. Just look at the alternative,"" Williams says. ""If we stay home, we lose this election. We can't let that happen."" But as Mr Trump seeks the presidency for a third time, he'll be looking to take advantage of Democrats' shrinking stronghold on black voters. ""That's just an opportunity that we would be remiss if we didn't exploit,"" a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said, according to the Associated Press. In addition to multiple celebrity endorsements from rappers like Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, Mr Trump has increasingly positioned himself on camera with his now-defeated opponent, Tim Scott. Mr Scott, South Carolina's first black US senator, has been widely discussed as a possible vice-presidential pick for Mr Trump. It's an idea Mr Scott seems to be courting. ""I just love you"", he told the former president from the stage after Mr Trump's latest victory in the Republican race. In Winnsboro, where the population barely nudges above 3,000, and the fried chicken gets served at the gas station, voter frustration is not hard to find. There's a barbershop on the town's main street, one of few businesses not permanently closed. Clarence Pauling, the shop's owner, has a quick response for anyone who asks him what he thinks of President Biden: ""I'll never vote for Biden again."" The proposition itself sparks a stir in the small black-owned business. ""Yes Lord!"" one man shouted, listening in while getting his hair cut. ""Giving all that money to Ukraine. You got people right here that need it. We got homeless people sleeping at the bus stop."" Mr Pauling, 49, historically has been a staunch Democratic supporter and says he even used his barbershop to register voters to support Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 elections. But not this year. He's strongly considering voting for Donald Trump, a desired change of pace from Mr Biden who he says ""talks a good game, but doesn't deliver"". Others in the barbershop agree and express frustration with the cost of gas and groceries. ""Trump tells the truth,"" says Pauling, laughing as he recalled when Mr Trump frankly told Hillary Clinton that he uses the ""rigged system"" to his advantage. ""I can dig that. I'm tired of everybody trying to be politically correct,"" he said. ""Tell it like it is."" The creatures are venomous reptiles native to the south-western US, but their bites are rarely fatal. The unnamed woman is accused of raising funds for the Ukrainian army. The American man lured two US women off a trail near Germany's famous Neuschwanstein Castle last year. ""I know the justice system will prevail,"" he says - but the lottery claims to have posted his numbers in error. Inflation is down and ""vibes"" are up - but younger Americans especially remain sceptical after the pain of soaring prices. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,,Joe Biden says 2024 U.S. election 'all about' whether America's democracy will survive,"U.S. President Joe Biden warned Friday that Donald Trump's efforts to retake the White House in 2024 pose a grave threat to the country, the day before the third anniversary of the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol by then-president Trump's supporters aiming to keep him in power.  Speaking near Valley Forge, Penn., where George Washington and the Continental Army spent a bleak winter nearly 250 years ago, Biden said that Jan. 6, 2021, marked a moment where ""we nearly lost America — lost it all."" He said the presidential race — a likely rematch with Trump, who is the far-and-away Republican front-runner — is ""all about"" whether American democracy will survive. The speech, the president's first political event of the election year, was intended to clarify the expected choice for voters this fall. Biden — who re-entered political life because he said he felt he was best capable of defeating Trump in 2020 — believes focusing on defending democracy to be central for persuading voters to reject Trump once again. ""We all know who Donald Trump is,"" Biden said. ""The question we have to answer is: Who are we?"" Biden laid out Trump's role in the Capitol attack, as a mob of the Republican's supporters overran the building while lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes that certified Democrat Biden's win. More than 100 police officers were bloodied, beaten and attacked by the rioters who overwhelmed authorities to break into the building. ""What's Trump done? He's called these insurrectionists 'patriots,'"" Biden said, ""and he promised to pardon them if he returns to office."" He chastised Trump for ""glorifying"" rather than condemning political violence. At least nine people who were at the Capitol that day died during or after the rioting, including several officers who died by suicide, a woman who was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who authorities said suffered medical emergencies. Biden said that by ""trying to rewrite the facts of Jan. 6, Trump is trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election."" Trump, who faces 91 criminal charges stemming from his efforts to overturn his loss to Biden and three other felony cases, argues that Biden and top Democrats are themselves seeking to undermine democracy by using the legal system to thwart the campaign of his chief rival. The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether Trump could be kept off the ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Speaking in Iowa Friday, Trump repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election and his assertion that the Capitol rioters were patriotic. He called the long prison sentences handed down for some offenders — whom Trump calls ""hostages"" and were convicted of crimes like assaulting police officers on Jan. 6 or seditious conspiracy — ""one of the saddest things."" Biden, in his remarks, seized on Trump's grievances and his pledges to get retribution on his political enemies. ""Donald Trump's campaign is about him,"" Biden said. ""Not America. Not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future."" He added: ""There's no confusion about who Trump is or what he intends to do."" Before his remarks, Biden, joined by his wife Jill, participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Valley Forge National Arch, which honours the troops who camped there from December 1777 to June 1778. He also toured the home that served as Washington's headquarters. Biden invoked Washington's decision to resign his commission as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won — and the painting commemorating that moment that resides in the Capitol Rotunda — to cast Trump as unworthy of Washington's legacy. ""He could have held onto that power as long as he wanted,"" Biden said of Washington. ""But that wasn't the America he and the American troops of Valley Forge had fought for. In America, our leaders don't hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people — willingly."" Audience Relations, CBC

,,The Miscellany News,"Vassar College's student newspaper of record since 1866 Posted on April 10, 2020 in Opinions If you’ve made up your mind to vote for Biden, I’m not trying to convince you otherwise. Thanks to the two-party system, many of you believe that not voting for Biden is akin to voting for Trump. I happen to disagree, and before you begin to belittle the people who will not be casting a vote with the Democratic party, please consider the following. I have not seen a single case for Biden to be elected beyond “he’s our best chance to beat Trump,” which is a weak case, considering a measly 24 percent of his supporters report feeling “very enthusiastic” about their candidate. Compare this mere 24 percent of enthusiastic supporters to Trump’s 53 percent, and recall Biden’s abysmal track record—opposing desegregation, backing the Iraq War, pushing to cut Social Security, persecuting Anita Hill, sexually assaulting Tara Reade, etc. Do you really wonder why he’s had trouble garnering support from progressive voters? I fail to see how Democrats have convinced themselves to rally around a candidate who is so wholly uninspiring and expect a different result than when we ran an unlikeable moderate in 2016. Imagine our current leaders saying “we need to unify and rally behind President Trump in the face of the COVID-19 crisis”—indeed, I know people who stand by this sentiment. But the president fired the experts who were trained to deal with a pandemic; he called the crisis a hoax; he ignored the literal handbook on how to deal with widespread contagion; he suggested hospitals and nurses are hoarding or wasting masks, rather than mobilizing the resources at the government’s disposal to obtain more masks and ventilators. In the face of this purely factual criticism, is the best solution still to blindly support our leader? Think about how disillusioned you are with our incompetent president, and then imagine the same treatment from every politician you’ve ever encountered. Imagine you’ve experienced marginalization, been left unemployed and without healthcare, and then told by Democratic elites that you must vote for their party because they will save you, even though they’ve failed to do anything that remotely addresses your lived experience in decades—that would just be too radical. These are the folks who voted for Trump in 2016, these are the folks Bernie was speaking to, and these are the folks who have no obligation to vote blue in November. I myself question whether President Biden would be that much less of an evil than President Trump. One supposed appeal of Biden’s campaign is that he’s able to appeal to moderates across the aisle; he’s not promising the idealistic, extreme left, “pie in the sky” policies that Bernie was pushing. He’s all about incremental change. Unfortunately, if we keep countering extreme fascism with anything moderate, anything but extreme anti-fascism, then we are going to continue to be pulled further and further into fascism. Consider Biden’s recent promise to lower the Medicare-eligible age to 60 and the praise he’s received for this concession. Then recall that four years ago, Hilary Clinton suggested lowering it to 55. We’re going backwards. The center is sliding further and further to the right. Universal healthcare, which has dominated our debate stage for decades, is perfectly reasonable and functional for 18 other countries, but the American political and moral compass is skewed to the right after years of attempting incremental change. Incremental change is not good enough—a fact that has become especially clear in the face of the global pandemic. Perhaps you’re thinking that I need to remember what matters: beating Trump. To this, I firmly say that if I have to set aside a lot of my principles in order to vote for a candidate, what does it matter that candidate’s party? Based on his track record, electing Biden is a win for the Republican Party in all ways but nominal. This year would have been the time for the Democratic party to evolve by throwing their weight behind Bernie Sanders. Instead, they bet everything on Grandpa Joe, a candidate who represents the Democratic party of an ancient time, but has not given any indication that he is prepared to lead Americans in any way (just look at his response to COVID-19, which is at times incoherent). Biden’s campaign website promises a few progressive policies (such as restoring DACA), but when I search for evidence that he will follow through on those promises, there is nothing to be found. Are you really asking me to put my blind faith in someone whose campaign is funded by 44 billionaires, made up of mainly venture capitalists and real estate moguls? We don’t have two parties. We have a ruling class of elite politicians who work for lobbyists and look out for their own interests. The two parties are simply a “false choice,” like choosing between two brands of shampoo at the drugstore that both come from the same parent company. Democrat versus Republican is a distraction. The Democratic party has betrayed the ideals that it supposedly represented; it’s time to disrupt the two-party system. If you are truly willing to “vote blue no matter who,” that means that you are willing to compromise on any number of your values in order to keep a Republican out of office. I shudder at the potential for “compromise” to become a willingness to brush aside significant issues in order to vote for a rapist whose policies have historically been very very bad for Black Americans. That’s privilege. Furthermore, if you are pushing that slogan, we will never be able to hold a single Democratic candidate accountable for progressive policies, because they know they will capture your vote regardless. We cannot keep pretending that rewarding a candidate with our vote doesn’t mean anything. I know that my vote has value; that’s precisely why I can’t just give it away to a party or a candidate that doesn’t represent me. Instead of voting for a meaningless party demarcation, I will vote based on policy. If tens of thousands of people said, “Hey, Biden, we refuse to vote for you unless you support Medicare for All,” then maybe he would listen, and I could consider voting for him. But it is simply not sufficient for the media (or for our peers!) to take a candidate and demand our unity. Ideally, a candidate that actually represents the needs of the people will unify us with their actions. If Biden wants to be that candidate now, he needs to actually earn the progressive vote.  If your daily life does not drastically change based on the policies of whatever president is in office, and yet you are campaigning with all your might for a presidential candidate, then you might be imagining politics as a reality TV show you get to participate in. How fun, how inhuman! I understand that Biden will reinstate civility. He will restore America’s facade of liberalism and development. He will be less overtly xenophobic and vulgar than our current president. He will let you sleep better at night because you can feel as if you did your part to support progressivism by voting blue no matter who. This peace of mind is exactly what’s so terrifying about Biden becoming president: I worry we will stagnate. Both Trump and Bernie, from opposite ends of the political spectrum, succeeded in stirring people up. Trump’s open racism enraged liberals—and rightfully so. Obviously it’s harmful and embarrassing to have this current incompetent idiot in the White House. But I fear that liberalism, forcibly stirred up by the overt injustices of the current administration, will die a silent death if Biden, a covert conservative, is handed the office. Once we acknowledge the truth—that voting for Biden is mostly symbolic—you have to ask: what’s the benefit of preserving that symbol? In the 2016 election, the DNC told hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised American citizens that they don’t matter. That is what led to Trump’s election; he was an anti-establishment candidate who (disingenuously) appealed to people who were reaching out for help. Bernie was our only shot at beating Trump; he was our progressive answer to the anti-establishment candidate. Many of the states Biden won during the primary (Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, etc.) are dependably red in the general election anyway. I don’t believe he has even a fraction of the magnetism required to swing the states that really count, and I sincerely doubt that his debate performances will contradict that perception. If you’re voting for Biden, I won’t try to convince you otherwise, but I will urge you to stop trying to guilt progressive voters into choosing him. Perhaps if we make the DNC worried about winning, they could urge their puppet to adopt better policies in order to attract voters. And even if that doesn’t happen, I still believe we are justified in refusing to choose between two rapists. Ultimately, what’s the point of directing energy toward a campaign that will ultimately change nothing about our society, and a candidate who is far from likely to win the general election? Instead of trying to convince disenfranchised people to believe in a system that excludes them, let’s demand more from the Democratic Party. Instead of wasting our votes on a candidate who will continue their corruption, let’s show them that we’ve had enough of incremental change. If the Green Party receives just 5 percent of the national vote, they receive federal funding for the next election as an officially recognized national party. Their candidates can begin to appear on ballots. They will begin to receive attention and resources to further their progressive campaign. We can break away from the two-party system if we stop wasting our votes on party loyalty. Before you wage war on the enormous coalition of voters who desperately want change, consider devoting that energy into something that matters a lot more. We can flip the senate to blue. We can support Shahid Buttar and other progressive challengers of incumbent politicians. We can donate and volunteer with local grassroots campaigns. We can support local candidates who will make change in our communities. If we can’t have top-down change, let’s make it happen bottom-up. Without a truly progressive president, that happens a lot more slowly, but it’s still possible. Activism doesn’t begin or end with a vote. Let’s not lose sight of the battles that are really worth fighting. [Corrections and Notes (04.18.2020): A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Joseph R. Biden (D-DE) voted to confirm Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. Biden was the chairman of the committee that approved Thomas. The clause referring to that vote has been removed. Note that the previous version also referred ambiguously to the enthusiastic approval rating among supporters of Donald Trump, which is 53 percent; the sentence did not refer to Trump’s overall approval rating, which at the time of this corrections notice is approximately 44.1 percent (with approximately 53 percent disapproval). Please additionally note that Opinions articles do not reflect the views of The Miscellany News as a whole, but solely those of the author.] If we do not vote against Trump and the republican party, who are actively making our country hostile to progressive issues ( i.e. hollowing out American’s faith in the government, placing young and far right conservatives to judicial positions, blocking any bills that come from the House, and CONTINUOUSLY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE OF MARGINALIZED IDENTITIES TO VOTE!) we all have to fork over our “progressive” cards because we are complicit in longterm authoritarianism and subjugation. period. *and the we means people like myself who voted for sanders btw Bernie Sanders is in support of Biden! This argument just can’t be made in good faith. Biden’s policy platform is the most liberal of any presumptive democratic nominee ever! Yes, Joe Biden is far from perfect, but like most other people have no problem seeing- he’s leaps and bounds better than Donald Trump! To equate the two is simply false, and frankly disrespectful to Joe. Please compare the two once more for yourself. I think it’s important to realize Bernie’s ideological influence on the Democratic Party. For example, a single payer health system is at this point, in my opinion, an inevitability in this country, in large part because of Bernie. And let’s not forget. This race was NOT close. Biden won by a MASSIVE margin against Bernie. Far from it even being a competition. Bernie hit a ceiling, and it was low. Bernies black vote numbers were abysmal, just as they were 4 years ago. I guess he couldn’t figure that one out, or maybe he didn’t even try. Let’s be productive here. Let’s make change where we can. Let’s force Joe to elect high impact progressives to his team. He’s already very inclined to do so. He even pledged to chose a woman for VP! What if he chose Warren? Would you stay on top of your privileged ideological pedestal then too? No pledge has ever been made like that! Frankly I don’t care it’s performative, and to widen his appeal- it’s fantastic either way! It’s basically equivalent to looking at a mother separated from her child at the border, or a Muslim blocked from entry to the country, and saying, “Sorry, can’t help you. Biden just isn’t Bernie.” THAT is privilege. Would also like to point out that the list of people who are urging progressives to vote for Biden includes Sanders. https://apnews.com/a1bfb62e37fe34e09ff123a58a1329fa?fbclid=IwAR2ZiAUImZfyCtW0p4BjHWyrH1U8S3jbIJ4YHzbJ9XV7JTFhn–r1BGYIUw love this This article makes me sick. Many people have died unavoidable deaths under the Trump administration. Children are being locked in cages at the border. The supreme court and federal courts have been packed with radical anti-choice judges. Some people do not have the privilege to vote based on ideological purity. Biden is not as progressive as I would like either, but come on! He proposes a $15 minimum wage, strong gun control, tuition free public college for families making under $125k. The Republican party has literally systematically destroyed our democracy over the last four years. We need to vote Democratic or PEOPLE WILL DIE. Have you considered that our most recent ~moderate~ president (Barack Obama) was followed by the most popular progressive candidate in American history (Bernie Sanders)? In no way will progressivism under Biden (presidents are figureheads anyway), but the entire country is at dire risk under Trump. This article makes it seem like what we have to save here is progressivism, not abolishing the death penalty, eliminating private prisons, minimum wage raise, lowering cost of college for many, expanding debt relief, boosting teacher pay, universal background checks, ending offshore drilling, reducing carbon emissions, voluntary gun buybacks, lowering prescription drug costs, improved infrastructure, ending past marijuana convictions, increasing capital gains tax rate, increasing taxes on the wealthy, expanding healthcare coverage, etc. All of those are REAL policies that Biden supports. In no way will Biden’s more moderate (in comparison to Bernie) beliefs kill progressive policies, but they will give them somewhere to start, and will move MUCH further on them than Trump could ever. This election isn’t about saving the soul of progressivism, because it is not at risk under Biden, but it (and MUCH more) is under Trump! It’s irresponsible to base an article off of what you’ve heard alone instead of researching the policies of people you are discussing. If Trump is re-elected then you might never have the chance to vote in another presidential election for your more progressive candidate. Do they study 1930s Germany at Vassar? It’s good to have some historical perspective on how democracies die before doing your part to kill off this one. Biden’s not the candidate who had trouble getting the black vote, Bernie was. I find that an educated person abstaining from voting for the Democratic Party is actually more selfish than progressively selfless. To stop Donald Trump means to slow authoritarianism as seen in social media, in his rallies, in his policies, and in the attitudes of his supporters and American life. It means saving literally thousands, if not millions (because who knows what will happen in the next four years) of people. If you are so bent on constantly zeroing in on your preconceived and “moral” values for the sake of making yourself feel better rather than focusing on actually trying to make life for an immeasurable number of people better, then not only are you ignorant of the lessons of history and politics, but you are also acting “immoral” in your false and poorly justified sense of morality. This coming election is not between a Democrat and a Republican. It is between Donald Trump and somebody who wants to stop Donald Trump. And that somebody is Joe Biden, who contrary to your belief, is a progressive who is labeled as a moderate! Biden’s policies and propositions are based off of compassion, accommodations for the disadvantaged in all walks of life, and truth. There are a couple factual errors with this piece. First, Trump doesn’t have 53 percent overall approval; he has 53 percent overall *disapproval*. And related to this, it is inaccurate to say that Biden has less support than Trump. You can’t compare “very enthusiastic” support for one candidate to overall support for another, but that’s exactly what this article tries to do. In fact, according to a recent Ipsos poll (https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2020-04/2020_reuters_tracking_-_core_political_coronavirus_tracker_04_15_2020_0.pdf), among all adults Trump has 25 percent “strong approval” (statistically equivalent to Biden’s 24 percent cited in this article)–and 36 percent “strong disapproval.” Furthermore, the same poll found that, were the election to happen today, Biden would win 42 percent of the vote (or 45 percent just among registered voters) to Trump’s 38 percent (40 percent if among registered voters). So it is in fact false that Biden would lose to Trump. But more importantly, there is a more nuanced reason to support Biden, and that regards what a president actually has immediate powers over: military action, executive orders, and nominations to cabinet and judiciary–including to the SCOTUS, that gang of nine able to strike down your most desired policies for unconstitutionality. Right now, the SCOTUS–because of Trump nomination Brett Kavanaugh–as a 5-4 conservative majority. Most of those conservatives would be happy to overturn, for example, Roe v. Wade and Casey, and strike down single-payer healthcare, M4A, the Green New Deal, campaign finance reform, gun bans, etc. Remember that RBG is also quite old and has already had cancer several times. Chances are she will die within the next 4 years. Trump would have the opportunity to nominate a conservative in her place–and it also looks like the Senate is going to remain in the hands of the GOP. That will give the SCOTUS a 6-3 conservative majority for possibly 40 years. Even if Bernie or AOC becomes president within that timeframe, any kind of change you want will likely be blocked. With Biden, at least the SCOTUS won’t have that opportunity. Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t want to see progressivism fall dead in the water before it even had a chance; and I’m not willing to wait until I’m nearing retirement age to finally have that chance, just because one presidential nominee was not perfect. Especially if you live in a swing state, not voting for Biden is voting for your indifference to the success of the progressive movement. I forgot to add, Biden also did NOT vote to confirm Clarence Thomas. He voted AGAINST. (https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220) (Where were the fact-checkers on this one?) Thank you for bringing these errors to our attention. A corrections notice has been issued. He did not vote for Clarence Thomas. Seriously, please do not publish disinformation like this again. https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=102&session=1&vote=00220 Thank you for bringing this error to our attention. A corrections notice has been issued. You heard it here first, folks: Alice Woo is a Trump supporter! Al Gore lost Florida by 537 votes. If 538 more people had voted blue in 2000, George W. Bush would not have been president. That means no Iraq War, no state-sanctioned toture, no economic collapse in 2008 (or at least less severe). Al Gore would’ve appointed O’Connor and Rehnquist’s replacements on the Supreme Court. That means a solid liberal majority. Citizens United, Obergefell, Heller, and every other terrible conservative decision of the past two decades would’ve gone the other way. Voting rights and reproductive rights would not be so endangered today. Most importantly we would’ve had early and agressive action on Gore’s signature issue: the climate crisis. Back in 2000, a lot of stuck up “progressives” like you said the same things about Al Gore as you’re saying about Joe Biden now. “He’s too centrist”, “he’s too establishment”, “Gore and Bush are basically the same”. Lots of “progressive” activists told people to vote green party, like you are now. The Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader, won just under 100,000 votes in Florida. “Progressives” that valued purity over reality cost Al Gore the election and the world is much worse off for it. Marginalized folks who’ve had their voting rights ripped away by the Roberts court, the victims of the war on terror in the Middle East, the billions of people in the global South endangered by climate change, the thousands of students killed in mass shootings, the millions of workers crushed by the 2008 crisis were all worse off because purist “progressives” like you thought they were entitled to cast protest votes. Shame on you. This is why republicans win elections and it is one of many reasons why Trump won in 2016. Liberals are too picky about their candidates. Joe Biden was not my first choice either, I wanted a progressive candidate as well (Warren) but that is not what we got because the people spoke and chose Biden as the nominee. Voting green party is a nice idea, but it is throwing away your vote. With the way the American political system is setup currently there is a 0% chance that a third party candidate can come remotely close to winning. It is not the system I want either, but it is the one we have. To say Biden is just as bad as Trump is not just an exaggeration, it is uninformed. There is nothing worse for this country right now than another four years of Trump. He has blood on his hands, his mishandling and outright denial of the coronavirus has cost people their lives, he has locked up children who have committed no crime in inhumane prison cells at the border, he has subverted every institution we hold dear and he is openly encouraging racism, and people listen and respond to that. The list goes on and on. Joe Biden is not perfect, he has a lot of issues and a long track record in politics. But there is no questioning he would be better than Trump. He would work with Pelosi and the house effectively, he would put someone who is not a scumbag on the supreme court if a spot opens, and maybe most importantly he would appoint smart and capable people to all cabinet positions, including the heads of organizations like the NIH or EPA! You say the people voting for Biden even if they don’t love him is “privilege” but I think burning your vote on a third party instead of taking down Trump because “Biden is not the ideal progressive” is a very privileged position to be able to take. If your choices are eat something you don’t like or starve to death, I think the choice is pretty clear. Trump absolutely must be defeated, and although he has shortcomings, if you critically look at Biden he is lightyears ahead of Trump in every way. Not voting for Biden is irresponsible. “Let me begin by stating that, no matter the results of the primary, the Democratic party must unite behind whoever wins the nomination.” “I would never want the ire of Bernie Sanders supporters to detract from [the] campaign.” “If he [Sanders] does not win the primary, I will gladly campaign for Warren (or whoever wins the nomination) with everything I have.” -Alice Woo in an op-ed published on February 6th. Wow! Sloppy (if not borderline dangerous) journalism from the misc. Has any of this been fact checked? Never thought Vassar people could be to blame for four more years of Trump. Why did the Misc allow this to be published? Does anyone do any kind of fact-checking or editing? Almost every sentence has some kind of blaring factual error, gross mischaraterization, intentionally misleading bad-faith claims, or a mixture of all of the above. Some of her “points” in this are just asserting her feelings as facts without any kind of data to back then up. Just bizarre. Really slop journalism if you’d even want to call it that. This reflects really poorly on the Misc and whoever is supposed to be proofreading these opinions before publication. Y’all, I’m angry too. So angry. Angry that in the face of a global pandemic, there is no serious plan for universal healthcare. Angry that my parents worry everyday about college bills and groceries. Angry that friends, family, and lovers are hurt by sexual assault and rape. It’s okay to be angry. To feel sad. Like we’ve lost something; we have. As my therapist kindly reminded me yesterday, the 5 stages of grief can (sometimes) be useful to work through ANY period of loss. In no particular order, they are:
-denial
-anger
-bargaining
-depression
-acceptance
Without trying to be a therapist (I’m not), I feel like a lot of us are in denial right now. That’s totally natural, but we must remember that our actions/posts/comments have consequences. I see a lot of Shit-posting about Biden, as if he is not going to be the candidate running against trump come November. I totally get it. For months I’ve been hoping he is not going to be the one, but now it’s time to accept that he is. Accepting his nomination does not equate to accepting sexual violence, wealth disparity, or giving up on any of the other fights we must continue to fight. No. Standing alongside Biden means we are continuing to hold hope, to fight for what’s right, to not give up in our work to make the world better. Now is rough, I get it. But we must keep on keeping on. Realistically speaking, Biden is our only chance at beating trump, and it’s time to rally. Time to come out and vote. To be honest, I am a little worried based on some people’s stories and comments. I understand the anger, and the continuing need to speak out. But I challenge us all to continue fighting for the values that we believe in while thinking realistically about the effects of our words. Our votes, words, and images DO have power, and we can either fight trump or play into his divisive games. Let’s continue focusing on and fighting the fights we care about, while encouraging youth to GET OUT AND VOTE because Biden IS the lesser of two evils. This post is already WAY too long, but I have one more thing to share. At the prompting of my feminist studies class, I’ve been thinking a lot about tearing down binaries recently. Gender, sex, and sexuality binaries, as well as a whole host of other divides. And it’s ironic, but my women’s studies class is, in fact, what pushes me to stand behind Biden. Because while I support Bernie’s policies far more, it’s false to imagine a Bernie/Biden binary. In times of frustration such as these, it is important to remember that Biden and Bernie are not polar opposites. If you support one, it doesn’t mean you can’t vote for the other.
Thanks, love u all <3 stay safe out there (and stay home!) I think it’s problematic when journalists report on allegations as fact. It is unknown if Reade’s allegations are true, but Alice Woo seems to be a psychic. “Allegedly” is a wonderful word. Journalists should use it often. Yeah I find this absurd. I understand the frustration with Biden’s moderate policies, and no he’s not a candidate that inspires mass excitement. But putting those faults on the same level as Donald Trump is misinformed at best and willfully ignorant at worse. I believe in progressive policies, but the way towards them isn’t blackmailing the DNC – it’s working with Democratic establishment and convincing them of what’s best for the country. It’s showing up at general elections en masse as young people so policies begin to be catered to our wants. This kind of protest will only work to prolong destructive policies and make it harder to overcome the structural barriers already in place. I can’t condone sitting out of something this important due to inter party disagreements. The stakes are just too high. Oh so. I just wanted to add on (though I’m worried I’ll get lost in the sea of comments). Two close relatives of mine were very involved in the establishment of the Green Party in the 1990’s. One was the chair of the Green Party in their state in the early 2000’s. The former chair has told me that their involvement was “the worst mistake of my life and makes me more forgiving of other people’s stupid political decisions.” This relative has been forever saddled with the guilt of helping George W. Bush get elected, because Gore “didn’t seem progressive enough”. Alice, you yourself have criticized Bush’s presidency in a previous op-ed. Yet, you are tacitly supporting someone even worse. My former Green Party relatives are now Democrats. Because of Bernie’s message, they believe reform is possible within the party. But reform isn’t easy. It takes time. Biden is a compromise who is far from perfect. The other option on the ballot is a fascist. The choice should not be difficult. I can’t fathom why you’d think a strong green party (or any left-wing third party) would at all be helpful for progressives. I mean, you do know how the electoral college works, right? If the left-wing of the country splits significantly between Dems and Greens, you will be guaranteeing Republicans and their corporate conservative interests the presidency for all time. Forget about the swing states, I’m talking about California and New York going red. Maybe you should get off Twitter and read up on the election of 1912 to see how terrible an idea that would be. Even if, somehow, the Greens and Dems split the blue/swing states and no party gets 270 votes, the election goes to the House where each state delegation gets one vote, so the Republican will be guaranteed the presidency every time. Also you say that if the Greens get 5%, they will start to appear on ballots. You do know that the green party can and does appear on ballots already, right? They just have to follow the same rules as everyone else to qualify to be on the ballot. Jill Stein was on every ballot in 2016. Also very bold of you to assume that the Green Party will suddenly pick up tons of support just because they get 8 million dollars from the federal government (and they also wouldn’t be able to raise *any* other money outside of that 8 million). There’s no indication whatsoever that there is mass public appetite for the Green Party. Anyone with an iota of common Sense knows it’s electoral suicide. “Many of the states Biden won during the primary (Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, etc.) are dependably red in the general election anyway.” Okay, so the assumption in this statement is basically that the only states that should matter in the primary are swing states. Red States (and implicitly blue states) are going to reliably vote for one party so if someone does better there, it doesn’t matter. This thinking is very problematic and shortsighted and clearly wasn’t thought out very well, but I’m going to accept this premise for now and look at the actual primary results instead of just cherry picking the red States that Biden won: (This only includes states where Sanders was still in the race for most of voting so WY is left out) Sanders won 7 states. 2 were solid blue (CA,VT), 2 were solid red (UT,ND), 3 were swingy (CO, NV, NH). Biden won 21 states. 4 were solid blue (WA,MA,ME,IL), 9 were solid red (AK,ID,OK,MO,AL,MS,TN,SC,AR), AND 8 were swingy (TX,AZ,VA,NC,FL,WI,MI,MN). And for completion’s sake, Buttigieg won one swingy state (IA). So Biden won five more swing states than Bernie. All of them have higher electoral vote tallies too (Bernie’s highest, Colorado has 9 EVs while Biden’s lowest, Wisconsin has 10 EVs). By her own arbitrary standards, Biden still clearly wins but she produces this information so misleadingly and irresponsibly that it implies Biden really only won red states. In reality he won 3x as many states as Bernie and 2.7x as many swing states (with roughly 7.5x as many EVs). But there are even bigger problems for Woo’s hot take on red state primaries. First off, and most glaringly, there’s not a clear line between red/blue states and swing states. In the above analysis, I erred on the side of inclusivity in deciding what states were potential swing states. There are some that would say that VA,CO,NV, and MN should be counted as blue states while TX and IA should be red. So the distinction between states that are reliably red/blue and those that aren’t is murky. And that’s only if the election is close. If there’s a landslide victory by either party, they could pick up states even thought to be reliably blue/red. Remember, Obama won every swing state AND Indiana in 2008. Second, it is terribly insulting to the Democratic voters in red states (and blue states!) to imply that their votes don’t matter and their voices shouldn’t be heard. Woo goes on to complain about disenfranchisement in the 2016 primary (which there is little evidence of, Sanders actually benefitted from contests where turnout was artificially depressed like caucuses), but she reveals her true colors by arguing for the disenfranchisement of wide swaths of the Democratic party. This is especially egregious because the Democratic electorate in the red Southern states that propelled Biden to victory are made up predominantly by Southern blacks, a group that has historically been brutally disenfranchised by racist voting laws, lack of polling places, and domestic terrorism. It is BECAUSE these states go reliably red that black Southern Democrats should be included in the primary proccess–because it’s the only way that their voices are heard represented in presidential politics. Here Alice Woo argues, like the Dixiecrats and conservative Republicans that have ruled the South for centuries, that black people in the South shouldn’t have a say in our democracy just because they don’t agree with her. My last point is that even if we can’t win a red state in the presidential race, we need support in red states so we can win back the Senate, something Woo says she is in support of. Everyone knows that the Senate structurally privileges rural states over urban states and thus red states over blue states. We need candidates that energize our party in red states particularly because that helps down-ballot candidates in those states. The voters in South Carolina voted for Biden and gave him a landslide victory, practically bringing his campaign back from the dead and guaranteeing him the nomination. Biden might not win South Carolina, but the fact that he, the candidate South Carolinians chose, is the nominee can only help Jaime Harrison’s bid to unseat Lindsay Graham. On the flip side, if Bernie Sanders, a candidate that the SC electorate has shown no enthusiasm for, was the nominee, Harrison’s campaign would probably be DOA. That’s all I have to say about that, but this piece is filled with tons of specious claims that absolutely fall apart under further examination. I hope that people read this critically and am heartened by all the people in the comments pointing out it’s irresponsibility. I hope the author can learn from this criticism and those of others. “If you are truly willing to “vote blue no matter who,” that means that you are willing to compromise on any number of your values in order to keep a Republican out of office. I shudder at the potential for “compromise” to become a willingness to brush aside significant issues in order to vote for a rapist whose policies have historically been very very bad for Black Americans. That’s privilege.” I hold strong progressive values, and I truly believe that preventing a generation long conservative Supreme Court majority will have substantially more drastic implications than any other decision the next president makes, or any ideological repercussions from choosing of Biden. Not a single piece of progressive legislation will be passed in decades to come, and many standing decisions, including Roe v Wade, will be struck down. Voting suppression will become even more rampant than it is today, further restricting the power of the progressive movement. I really do understand where you’re coming from, and I thought the exact same way when I was at at Vassar during the 2016 election. But in recent years, I’ve just come to place more value on pragmatism than on ideological and theoretical values. This this type of thinking and these conversations are absolutely necessary and vital to have, and they do shape the direction of political movements. At the same time, reality matters. Tens if not hundreds of thousands of people in this country, predominantly low income and of color, will die as a direct result of the mismanagement of COVID19. If we were currently under a Biden administration, the prevention of life lost and economic hardship compared to Trump would vastly overshadow the difference in outcome between a Biden and Bernie administration. What I’m trying to say is that yes, in theory, I agree with many of your points. At the same time, I believe that we have to vote based on reality. If Trump wins another term, it will cause irreparable harm for decades to come, and no number of progressive presidents, representatives, or congresspeople we elect will be able to change that. If Biden wins, we’re still at least in the fight. The progressive movement will work to push him towards better policies, and there is at least some chance that we will succeed. Disagree with this top to bottom, but good on the editors for not censoring something they probably knew would be controversial. “I myself question whether President Biden would be that much less of an evil than President Trump.”
Alice Woo, after almost 3 more months of one of the most disastrous periods in our history , thanks to trump’s callous, incompetent, Covid-denying mismanagement, thousands of US residents have died tragically and unnecessarily.. The above thoughtful comments should also give you plenty of reasons not to throw away your vote, and instead vote for Biden. Remember, elections can have severe consequences, as seen in recent SCOTUS decisions. Should Trump be reelected, hopes for a progressive agenda disappear for decades with his next court appointment! Is that what you hope to achieve? The difference between a Trump presidency and a Biden presidency is a slight improvement in grammar and sentence structure and possibly some movement on the courts toward more progressive social policies. The list of similarities and policies that will change not at all are too long and too depressing to repeat. The reason we have elections featuring candidates I wouldn’t allow to babysit my children is the downward spiral we’ve endured for my entire lifetime. That is, the “we must defeat the other side at all costs” strategy. A losing strategy. A strategy that has been applied to every election I’ve been eligible to vote in and has not produced a single positive result. Yet there are always hordes of self-righteous voters who will pounce on anyone offering an opinion other that that proven loser strategy. Enough. Vote quietly and keep your fears and your voter shaming to yourselves. Clearly, you do not have the answers. There are only two people running for president that have any real shot at that job: Trump and Biden. But everyone with a brain knows a vote for Green Party candidates helps Republican candidates because such votes takes away votes from Democrate Candidates. Do a search for Republican Funding of Green Party Candidates and see how many hits you get. In fact, the Green Party of the United States (That’s the name of this Green Party) has worked with Republicans before. ” The End of the Green Party,” by Joshua Frank. When people stopped funding this party because Nader took enough votes that would have otherwise gone to Gore to help Bush win, the Greens went to the Leagure of the South and the Bush White House for help in raising money. In fact, the website of this Green Party even lies about when it started. It’s website tells us that it started in 1984. This is a lie. America’s first Green Party was the Green Committees of Correspondence. In 1991, it changed its name to the Greens/Green Party USA. When this party protested the war in Iraq with its White Paper, “No Blood For Oil” GPUSA was attacked by GPUS. “It’s Not Always Easy Being the Right Shade of Green, by Bruce Kyle of fhe Bango Daily News. In 1996, the Association of State Green Parties was formed. in 2001, it changed its name to the Green Party of the United States. Its first job was to destroy Greens/Green Party USA, which it did. It’s second job since has been to help Republicans win by running candidates to take votes away from Democrat candidates. In fact, in 2008, the Green Party candidate for U.S. Senator for PA. ran with 99 percent Republican money. Democracy Now! of Oct. 25, 2008.

,,Nikki Haley hasn’t yet won a GOP contest. But she’s vowing to keep fighting Donald Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — There are no wins on the horizon for Nikki Haley. Those close to the former United Nations ambassador, the last major Republican candidate standing in Donald Trump’s path to the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, are privately bracing for a blowout loss in her home state’s primary election in South Carolina on Saturday. And they cannot name a state where she is likely to beat Trump in the coming weeks. But ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of Saturday’s result. And backed by the strongest fundraising numbers of her political career, she vowed to stay in the fight against Trump at least until after Super Tuesday’s slate of more than a dozen contests on March 5. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In fact, some Republicans are encouraging Haley to stay in the campaign even if she continues to lose — potentially all the way to the Republican National Convention in July. Her continued presence could come in handy in the event that the 77-year-old former president, perhaps the most volatile major party front-runner in U.S. history, becomes a convicted felon or stumbles into another major scandal. As Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement presses for her exit, a defiant Haley will outline her rationale for sticking in the race for the foreseeable future Tuesday afternoon in South Carolina. In an interview ahead of the speech, she highlighted Trump’s legal exposure and criticized MAGA activists who say she’s hurting Trump’s chances against President Joe Biden in the general election by refusing to drop out. “That’s about the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. If I get out of the race today, it will be the longest general election in history,” Haley said. She also pushed back when asked if there is any primary state where she can defeat Trump. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” Haley’s hurdles History would suggest Haley has no chance of stopping Trump. Never before has a Republican lost even the first two primary contests, as Haley has by an average of 21 points, and gone on the win the party’s presidential nomination. Polls suggest she is a major underdog in her home state on Saturday and in the 16 Super Tuesday contests to follow. And since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015, every effort by a Republican to blunt Trump’s rise has failed. Yet she is leaning into the fight. Lest anyone question her commitment, Haley’s campaign is spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan ahead of the state’s Feb. 27 primary, according to spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. At the same time, the AP has obtained Haley’s post-South Carolina travel schedule that features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Indeed, Haley’s expansive base of big- and small-dollar donors is donating at an extraordinary pace despite her underwhelming performance at the polls. That’s a reflection of persistent Republican fears about Trump’s ability to win over independents and moderate voters in the general election and serious concerns about his turbulent leadership should he return to the White House. “I’m going to support her up to the convention,” said Republican donor Eric Levine, who co-hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month. “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” “There’s value in her sticking in and gathering delegates, because if and when he stumbles,” Levine continued, “who knows what happens.” Levine is far from alone. Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, Perez-Cubas said. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever — which includes $2 million in small-dollar donations online in the 48 hours after Trump threatened to “permanently bar” Haley supporters from his MAGA movement. Haley raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. The lone member of Congress who has endorsed Haley, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., insisted that she would stay in the race even if she is blown out in South Carolina, a state where she lives and served two terms as governor. “Obviously, you want to win them all, but for those who say it’s going to embarrass her, or end her political career, I disagree. She’s willing to take that risk,” Norman said in an interview. “I think it’s a courageous thing she’s doing.” Moving forward, Haley’s team is especially focused on several Super Tuesday states with open or semi-open Republican primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate — especially independents and moderates — instead of just hardcore conservatives. Trump not happy Trump, in recent days, has shown flashes of fury in response to Haley’s refusal to cede the nomination. He called her “stupid” and “birdbrain” in a social media post over the weekend and his campaign released a memo ahead of her speech on Tuesday predicting that she would be forced out of the race after losing her home state on Saturday. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” Trump’s campaign chiefs wrote. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Eager to pivot toward a general election matchup against Biden, the Republican former president is taking aggressive steps to assume control of the Republican National Committee, the GOP’s nationwide political machine, which is supposed to stay neutral in presidential primary elections. Last week, Trump announced plans to install his campaign’s senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as RNC’s chief operating officer and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the committee’s co-chair. And there is every expectation that current Chair Ronna McDaniel will step down after Trump wins South Carolina’s primary and party officials will ultimately acquiesce to Trump’s wishes. Privately, Haley’s team concedes there is nothing it can do to stop the Trump takeover. In the interview, Haley warned her party against letting Trump raid the RNC’s coffers to pay for his legal fees while taking a short-term view of Trump’s political prospects. Trump’s standing will fundamentally change if he is a convicted felon before Election Day, Haley said, acknowledging that such an outcome is a very real possibility as Trump navigates 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” As for her path forward, Haley said she’s focused only on her plans through Super Tuesday. As for staying in the race through the July convention, she said she hasn’t thought that far ahead. Some voters wish she would. Gil White, a 75-year-old Republican veteran from James Island, South Carolina, said he was a Trump loyalist until the former president criticized Haley’s husband, a military serviceman, last week. “For him to disparage a military man in deployment is just too much,” White said while attending a Haley rally in Kiawah Island over the weekend. He acknowledged concerns about Haley’s chances against Trump, but said he wants her to stay in the race even if she continues to lose. “I want the choice,” he said. ___ AP writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.

,,"""Who's paying for it?"": Fake Biden robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home","Help keep Salon independent A fake robocall purporting to be from President Joe Biden targeted New Hampshire voters, telling them to stay away from the polls in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday, per NBC News.  The New Hampshire attorney general was prompted to look into the matter after Kathy Sullivan, a top New Hampshire Democrat who runs a super PAC that urges Democrats in her state to write in Biden's name in the primary, filed a complaint. NBC reported that Sullivan's personal cell phone number appeared in the caller ID of those receiving the robocall.  “What a bunch of malarkey,” the phony message begins, citing an oft-used phrase by Biden. The message adds that “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election.” “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” the message says. ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. ""These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely."" Sullivan in an interview said she began receiving calls on Sunday from people who had received the robocall.  “I said, ‘You got a call from Joe Biden, and he gave you my number?’” Sullivan said after one person, who was not a Biden supporter, informed her of the call. A volunteer for the super PAC who also received the call was able to tape it, sharing it with the write-in group's organizers who then passed it on to NBC. Though the source of the bogus call has not yet been identified, “It’s obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden,"" Sullivan said.  “I want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible because this is an attack on democracy,” Sullivan added. “I’m not going to let it go. I want to know who’s paying for it? Who knew about it? Who benefits?” ",www.salon.com,https://www.salon.com/2024/01/22/whos-paying-for-it-fake-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-to-stay-home/,"Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

,,,"2024 ELECTIONS A whole swath of GOP voters appears firmly committed to not voting for Trump in November. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a crowd at a campaign stop at SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Jan. 20, 2024. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO 01/23/2024 05:00 AM EST  Donald Trump has a problem no matter what happens in New Hampshire on Tuesday night: There’s a whole swath of the Republican electorate and a good chunk of independents who appear firmly committed to not voting for him in November if he becomes the nominee. It’s an issue that became starkly apparent in polling ahead of the Iowa caucuses, when an NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of voters in that state found that fully 43 percent of Nikki Haley supporters said they would back President Joe Biden over Trump. And it’s a dynamic that has been on vivid display as the campaign shifted this week to New Hampshire. “I can’t vote for Trump. He’s a crook. He’s too corrupt,” said Scott Simeone, 64, an independent voter from Amherst, who backed Trump in 2016 and 2020. “I voted for him, and I didn’t realize he’s as corrupt as he is.” Primary elections can create intra-party divisions that, in the moment, seem impossible to heal. In 2008, a bloc of Hillary Clinton supporters started the PUMA (Party Unity My Ass) movement as a threat to never back Barack Obama after that bruising primary. Bernie Sanders’ supporters vowed to never support Clinton eight years later. In 2016, Trump himself faced pushback to his nomination all the way up to the convention floor.       But 2024 is different. Trump is not making his pitch to voters as a first time candidate. He is a known quantity who is being judged by the electorate not for the conduct of his current campaign so much as his time in office. And that, political veterans warn, makes it much harder for him to win back the people he’s alienated, including those once willing to vote Republican. The data supports the idea that there are problems ahead for the former president. Even before the Iowa survey, a New York Times/Siena College poll found that — including independents who say they lean toward one party over the other — Biden had slightly more support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91 percent) than Trump did among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (86 percent). Supporters listen to Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley speak at her last campaign event before the primary in Salem, New Hampshire. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO That’s far from a majority of Republicans preparing to pass on Trump in November. But in a close election, it could be enough to tip the scales for Democrats. At a minimum, it is a major liability for the GOP should the party, as expected, push Trump through as its nominee. “It would be a massively difficult hill to climb, without a doubt,” New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Haley endorser, told reporters of the party’s chances of winning New Hampshire in the general election with Trump on top of the ticket, when asked by POLITICO. “And he’s already proven that. He’s lost before and according to the polls he will lose even bigger this time.” Sean Van Anglen, a prominent and early Trump supporter in the state who now plans to vote for Haley on Tuesday, said if Trump becomes the nominee, he might have to blank that line on his November ballot. “I don’t think I can vote for Trump,” he said. “I vote in every election, I’ve never left a box blank. And I might have to this time.” 2024 ELECTIONS Nikki Haley made strides for women in politics. There’s just one problem: Trump BY NATALIE ALLISON | JANUARY 22, 2024 05:57 PM That sentiment was not uncommon among Republicans here this week, especially among voters who came out to see Haley, the former U.N. ambassador. “I liked him. But he just scares me now. Everybody that has ever worked for him is not any more,” said Lisa Tracy, of Salem. If it came down to Biden versus Trump, she said, “I would go with Biden.” These problems are not entirely unique to Republicans. Biden himself is grappling with a Democratic Party where a portion of voters have soured on him and are either leaning towards or threatening to vote for a third party candidate or stay home in November. “We need to keep showing that it can’t just be two parties that no one fully agrees with,” said Michelle Greene, a 34-year-old registered independent from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who saw Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who is challenging the president in a primary, in Hampton on Sunday. Greene said it’s “definitely a concern” that a third-party candidate might siphon off votes from Biden in November. But she also wasn’t sure if she’d vote for Biden again, after backing him in 2020, in a head-to-head Biden-Trump rematch, adding that she “morally can’t support the lesser of two evils.”  How big a universe these groups of disaffected voters are could go a long way in determining the next president. But there are signs that, among independents at least, Trump is bleeding. In the New York Times/Siena College poll last month, Biden led Trump among all independents in the poll, 50 percent to 38 percent. At a brief press scrum on Saturday before Trump took the stage at a rally, the former president’s top adviser Chris LaCivita downplayed the numbers out of Iowa. A campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But at events across the Granite state over the past week, surrogates for Trump have stressed the need for Republican reconciliation, depicting Biden’s presidency as an existential threat. Trump supporters cheer prior to his speech at a campaign event in Manchester on Jan. 20. There are signs that, among independents at least, Trump is bleeding. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO Sununu, for his part, said he was ready to back Trump should he end up being the party’s standard-bearer. While Biden is a “decent person,” Sununu said, “his team is so bad.” But what was notable about his argument was that it was delivered under duress. Sununu was speaking to a voter who had cornered him while he wiped snow from his car in a parking lot outside a Haley rally. That voter had wanted to know how he could possibly turn around and cast a vote for Trump after being so openly critical of his governance. Others who attended the event agreed. Curtis Thornbrugh, 81, an independent from Rindge, had voted for Barry Goldwater, Bob Dole, and both Bushes before casting his ballot for Obama twice and Biden in 2020 (he did not say how he voted in 2016). He was open to backing Haley in 2024 but couldn’t see himself supporting Trump. “I can’t find anything good to say and I try,” he explained. “He’s dangerous and the people around him are, too.” Forbes Farmer, 79, a fellow independent from Rindge, also went to view Haley in person at that event. He said he’d lean towards supporting her if she ran against Biden in November.

,,,"                      38     by AHTRA ELNASHAR | The National Desk WASHINGTON (TND) — Voters in Michigan who are angry with President Joe Biden over his support for Israel have sent his campaign a loud and clear message: He cannot take their support for granted. An effort to protest the president by voting ""uncommitted"" in the state's presidential primary -- called the 'Listen to Michigan' campaign -- on Feb. 27 gained momentum after prominent progressive organization Our Revolution announced its support for the plan.

(Matthew Hatcher/Detroit News via AP) As of Monday, the death toll in Gaza since October 7 exceeded 29,000, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. While some staunch critics refuse to recognize any statistics from Hamas, the United Nations has said the ministry's figures have been historically consistent with their own. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has also endorsed the protest vote. The president is aware of the pushback: Earlier this month he sent top aides to Michigan to meet with Arab and Muslim community leaders. Those two groups represent a voting bloc Biden cannot afford to lose. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 206,000 Muslim registered voters, according to Emgage, a network of organizations focused on Muslim political engagement. Biden's attempt at outreach also comes after a November poll from the Arab American Institute found that his support among Arab voters plummeted from 2020, especially in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, when it was 60% to a mere 19%.

Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said she's had tough conversations with the president about this. ""I’ve got a lot of constituents, a lot of people that are neighbors and friends who are hurting, who have lost family, are scared for their family who have no food, no health care, no water. This is an issue that he’s got to talk about with people head-on. Donald Trump doesn’t offer any solutions, either,"" Dingell said in an interview with Fox News Monday. Some Democrats, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who also serves as co-chair for Biden's reelection campaign, have urged members of her party to keep up their support for the president instead of inadvertently helping former President Donald Trump, who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. El-Sayed pushed back on criticism that it will benefit Trump, emphasizing the protest vote's focus is on the Democratic primary, not necessarily the general election. ""While it’s clear that Biden will win the primary, it’s critical for him and his team to understand that votes in November have to be EARNED. And by voting uncommitted, I have the opportunity to count myself among the votes he’s putting in jeopardy in November,"" El-Sayed said in his post.

Biden's harshest public remarks about Israel came earlier this month when he called its conduct in the Gaza Strip ""over the top."" In private, Biden reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “pain in my a**."" The U.S., along with Qatar and Egypt, have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel on a potential deal for the release of hostages in exchange for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the president has not joined calls by other world leaders in calling for a permanent ceasefire.

,,The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election,"An official website of the United States government       What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most consequential global events since World War II, affecting virtually every country in the world. By the end of November 2020, more than 60 million people had contracted the virus and over one and a half million had died. In response to the pandemic, governments restricted citizens’ movement to varying degrees through lockdown measures, with the objective of slowing the spread of the disease. The pandemic contributed to severe economic contractions in most countries, increasing unemployment and poverty around the world.1 In the USA, the COVID-19 pandemic struck during a presidential election year, shifting the political narrative and Trump’s re-election prospects. Prior to the pandemic, the US economy was performing well, and Trump, while extremely polarizing, enjoyed strong support among Republican voters.2 The virus changed the narrative and shaped the political campaign. As of the end of November 2020, the USA had suffered the largest numbers of cases (over 8 million) and deaths (over 220,000) in the world. Trump’s pandemic response, which contrasted with those of many leaders in other Western democracies, was repeatedly criticized by epidemiologists and scientists. In this paper, we explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election. We investigate whether Trump’s electoral support fell in localities hit harder by the pandemic. Guided by a pre-analysis plan (PAP), which reduces concerns about data mining, we constructed a data set at the county-level, with the difference in vote share for Trump between the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections as our dependent variable.3 Our main independent variable is COVID-19 cases, which we gather from the data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In our estimates, we control for social distancing and four occupational measures: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. In addition, we account for demographic and socioeconomic variables and for changes in unemployment between August 2019 and August 2020. In placebo tests, we show that COVID-19 incidence is uncorrelated with changes in Republican candidates vote share in previous elections, e.g., votes for Trump in 2016 compared with votes for Romney in 2012. In an attempt to sharpen our identification strategy, we instrument COVID-19 cases with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. We show that counties with a larger share of workers employed in meat-processing factories experienced a significantly larger number of cases than counties with a smaller share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. Our two-stage least squares estimates also control for the share of manufacturing workers and the share of food manufacturing workers in each county as well as for counties’ vulnerability to Trump’s trade policies in an effort to validate the exclusion restriction. Our results indicate that COVID-19 cases had a significant negative effect on the Trump vote share in the 2020 presidential election (in comparison to 2016). This finding holds in both the reduced form analysis and the instrumental variable analysis. We also find potentially important heterogeneity in the effect of COVID-19. In particular, the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a formal stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that the change in the unemployment rate is related to electoral support for Trump. There is some evidence that COVID-19 cases affect voters’ mobilization, measured as the number of votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016. These effects not only are significant and robust to many robustness checks but they are also quite sizable. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if the number of COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin—likely resulting in his re-election. Our paper is related to several streams of the literature on political behavior and political economy.4 First, our paper speaks to the literature on retrospective voting, which examines how citizens evaluate and vote based on their perceptions of the incumbent’s performance (Fiorina 1981; Ferejohn 1986; Persson et al. 1997; Fearon 1999; Canes-Wrone et al. 2001; Ashworth 2012). Our findings indicate that voters assess the competence of political leaders in the case of a pandemic and hold them accountable for rising numbers of cases and deaths. This is consistent with evidence in Herrera et al. (2020), who find in a sample of 35 countries that approval of incumbent politicians falls as COVID-19 cases grow, as well as Gutierrez et al. (2020), who find that voters punished the incumbent government following the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico. Second, our paper is related to a literature that links shocks such as natural disasters to political behavior (Abney and Hill 1966; Chen 2012; Malhotra and Kuo 2008; Bechtel and Hainmueller 2011). The logic of this literature is similar to that of retrospective voting. Rational voters reward incumbents not only for delivering a positive economic performance in good times but also for organizing prompt rescue and relief programs in bad times, such as in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Our findings indicate that incumbent governments are punished electorally for failing to provide effective mitigation and relief, even if the primary shock (in this case, a virus) is not directly attributable to them. Third, our paper speaks to the literature on the effect of personally experiencing shocks (e.g., crises and wars) on political and social attitudes (Lau et al. 1978; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981; Erikson and Stoker 2001; Mo and Conn 2018). Our findings are consistent with studies showing that negative economic shocks increase support for government intervention in the economy and redistributive policies as well as people’s beliefs about the relative importance of luck versus effort (Margalit 2013; Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014). These changes in voters’ preferences and beliefs are consistent with increasing support for a Democratic candidate over an incumbent Republican president in the midst of a pandemic. Finally, our paper also relates to a growing literature on the pandemic. For instance, Allcott et al. (2020) rely on smartphone data and provide evidence that areas with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing. Baccini and Brodeur (2020) show that Democratic governors and governors without a term limit are significantly faster (and more likely) to adopt stay-at-home orders than Republican governors and governors with a term limit. Warshaw et al. (2020) demonstrate that states and local areas with relatively more COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support Republican House and Senate candidates. Other papers have explored related issues, such as policy responses and social distancing, in other countries such China and Italy (Qiu et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021; Milani 2021). News of a novel coronavirus made global headlines beginning in January 2020. On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a coronavirus-type pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began screening at three major US airports on January 20, and the first US coronavirus case was confirmed the following day. On January 23, China made the unprecedented move of quarantining Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The white House announced on January 31 a travel ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to China within the past 14 days. The first US death from the disease occurred on February 29 in Washington State.5 The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. That same day the US National Basketball Association suspended all games, and the actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for the virus in Australia. Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, unlocking up to $50 billion dollars in federal funding to combat the spread of the disease, the same day on which several states announced school closures. On March 19, California became the first state to issue a “stay-at-home” order, with exceptions for work and shopping for essential needs. On March 26, Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which provided $2 trillion in aid to businesses, hospitals, and local governments. While no country was unaffected, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the USA particularly hard. The US COVID-19 death toll passed the grim mark of 100,000 on May 28; by September 22, 200,000 American lives had been lost. Measured on a per capita basis, only Brazil, Spain, and Mexico have recorded higher death rates among large countries.6 Along with lost lives, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the USA exerted a profound economic impact. Increasing numbers of cases caused changes in consumer behavior, with large drops in consumption of services (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020) leading to an unprecedented increase in unemployment (Chetty et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020). The economic downturn coincided with changing political attitudes about the role of government, with Rees-Jones et al. (2020a) finding deaths and infections associated with increased support for expanding the US safety net. In sharp contrast to most world leaders and to his opponent Joe Biden, Trump sought to downplay the threat of the virus, with limited political success. He began this tactic early in the crisis, and never veered from it. On February 10, Trump claimed, “a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat...” On February 26, as US cases began to appear, he said, “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Again, on April 3, he remarked, “It is going to go away. It is going away.” He continued making similar comments throughout the summer, and in his first remarks after contracting the virus himself in October, he declared, “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”7 The tactic did little to help his standing with the electorate. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating fell from a 2020 high of 49% on March 22 to 38% on June 30.8 Polls showed nearly 60% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s response to the pandemic, with very little variation in the 5 months leading up to the election.9 There are several reasons to believe that the pandemic and the Trump administration’s response were detrimental to Trump’s reelection prospects. The strong disapproval of the president’s handling of the virus suggests that a majority of the public blamed the administration for its failure to curtail its spread. Most importantly, voters likely associate rising local cases and deaths with an increasing threat to the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. In this context, we might expect that the greater the local exposure to risk, the more likely voters are to punish the president by voting for the challenger. Another channel through which COVID-19 may have lead to diminished Trump support is economic. Despite a big rebound in economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate remains well above the historical average. Ominously, rising case numbers in the lead-up to the election portended another wave of hospitalizations and deaths—and the prospect of more localized lockdowns, business closures, and a double-dip recession. Both retrospective and prospective voting frameworks suggest that voters are likely to hold the president accountable for the toll of the virus. For these reasons, we examine whether more severe local outbreaks are associated with weaker support for Trump in 2020, compared to the 2016 presidential election. There is, however, a counter-argument to be made. A possible interpretation of Trump’s strategy in responding to the pandemic is that it was in line with the preferences of his core constituents. Survey data reveal a striking difference in attitudes toward the pandemic between Democratic and Republican voters. According to Gallup, only 25% of Republican respondents are “worried about getting the coronavirus,” whereas this percentage climbs to almost 80% among Democratic respondents.10 Similarly, about 60% of Republican respondents are “ready to return to normal activities right now,” whereas a mere 3% of Democratic respondents are ready to resume a normal lifestyle. We see similar differences for questions related to practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. While ideology influences attitudes toward the pandemic in other countries as well, the differences between Democratic and Republican voters in the USA are uniquely large. In short, given the polarization of US politics, voters seem to be experiencing the very same event in very different ways based on their partisan identities. If this is the case, even a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths may not meaningfully reduce support for Trump, especially among his base. We describe all the data that we use in our analysis below. Our analysis relies on known COVID-19 cases and deaths, recorded at the county-level. We use the COVID-19 incidence data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The data and data sources at the state and county levels can be accessed here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths correspond to October 22, 2020. In our sample, the mean for the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 is 247 (std. dev. 157), while the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 is 53 (std. dev. 56). Figure 1 and Appendix Fig. 4 illustrate the distribution of cases and deaths in the USA, respectively. Cumulative Number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 as of October 22, 2020 Cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 as of October 22, 2020 We also gather data on the following COVID-19 policies: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for individuals arriving from another state. Data on policy duration are drawn from Raifman et al. (2020). See our discussion paper for more details about these policies (Baccini et al. 2020). We draw social distancing data from Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. This data set captures visits to a location relative to a baseline day using data from users who have enabled “location history” in their Google account. The baseline day is the median value for the 5-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020. We rely on workplace as the location of interest as of April 1, 2020, i.e., the midpoint of the first COVID-19 wave. We also rely on mobility change as of August 1st as a robustness check, i.e., the midpoint of the second wave.11 We merge variables capturing COVID-19 incidence by county with data on county-level election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections.12 We compute the difference of vote shares of Trump between the 2020 and 2016 US presidential elections. Specifically, we compute shares dividing the total number of votes for Trump by the total number of votes in each county. Table 1 provides summary statistics, and Fig. 2 illustrates changes in voting share from 2016 to 2020. The map shows that Trump’s support fell in parts of the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt in 2020 compared with the 2016 presidential election.13 Descriptive statistics Authors’ calculations. Election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. Electoral outcomes are not weighted (by the number of registered voters). Changes in Trump voting (2020–2016) and Trump voting (2020) are in percentages. Cumulative COVID-19 cases, cases per 10,000 people, deaths, and deaths per 100,000 people are the cumulative totals corresponding to October 22, 2020. Share of employment in meat-processing factories is computed using data from the County Business Patterns. Monthly unemployment data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics Changes in share of votes for Donald Trump from 2016 to 2020. This figure illustrates the differential in vote shares for Trump in 2020 and 2016  We rely on the County Business Patterns (CBP) to compute the share of employment in meat-processing factories. Of note, there are jobs in this industry for about 52% of counties. The CBP provides annual data for establishments with paid employees within the USA. This data set provides annual employment data at the county-level for the week of March 12 and annual payroll data. Note that the CBP does not include employment for most establishments with government employees and the following NAICS industries: crop and animal production; rail transportation; Postal Service; pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; office of notaries; private households; and public administration. See https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/about.html for more details. Last, we get monthly unemployment rates at the county-level from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics. In our sample, the mean change in the unemployment rate from August 2019 to August 2020 was an increase of 2.87.14 We rely on four occupational indexes as control variables: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. The first three indexes were built in Beland et al. (2020), while the remote work index comes from Dingel and Neiman (2020). These indexes serve as covariates in our analysis since they have been shown to be related to the severity of job losses in the USA and could be related to voting behavior and COVID-19 incidence. In this section, we describe the empirical strategy that was pre-specified in a PAP. We first present our OLS model and provide evidence that our model is more appropriate than a naïve model relating COVID-19 incidence and Trump vote share. We then describe the IV specification, in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence with the share of employment in meat-processing plants. As stated in our PAP, we first rely on the following model: where Yc is the differential in Trump’s vote share in 2020 and 2016 for county c. COVIDIncidencec is the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants as of October 22, 2020.15 We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. We include in the model Xc, which is a vector of county-level variables. We include the following demographic and socioeconomic variables: population, share of female population, share of foreign-born population, share of population with a college degree, share of non-Hispanic Black population, share of non-Hispanic white population, share of population by age group (9 dummies), social mobility index, and four occupational indexes. Moreover, we compute employment changes due to the pandemic at the county-level by taking the unemployment rate as of September 2020 minus the unemployment rate as of September 2019.16 The inclusion of these variables is key to our identification assumption that no omitted variables are related to COVID-19 incidence and the change in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election. Finally, 𝜃s represents state fixed effects. This set of fixed effects allows us to further control for county-level characteristics that are common to counties within the same state. Our estimation is thus at the county-level and we effectively test whether counties with relatively more COVID-19 cases or deaths differentially voted for the Trump in 2020 compared with the previous presidential election. We use this model instead of a model relating COVID-19 incidence to vote share in 2020 alone to better capture trends in voting behavior. In other words, we compare how voting behavior changed pre- and post-COVID-19 rather than simply analyzing voting behavior post-COVID-19. We believe this is crucial in this context given the increasing political polarization in the USA. Moreover, we think that the inclusion of state fixed effects and controlling for social distancing and a large set of demographic variables helps account for differential (changes in) behavior and preferences across counties. This is also crucial because a growing literature has shown, for instance, that individuals identifying as Republicans are less likely to comply with social distancing orders than those identifying as Democrats (e.g., Allcott et al. 2020; Gollwitzer et al.2020). We complement the reduced form analysis with an instrumental variable approach. The concern we attempt to address is that COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths do not occur at random, but rather they correlate with individuals’ behavior, which may be different between those who vote for the Democratic Party and those who vote for the Republican Party. For instance, it may be that voters living in “red” (i.e., Republican-leaning) counties are less likely to observe social distancing or to wear masks. If this is the case, this type of behavior would be likely to increase the number of COVID-19 cases (and in turn COVID-19 deaths) and we would observe a larger share of votes for Trump than for Biden in the same counties. While we control for social distancing in the previous analysis, we may have missed some other confounders in our analysis. To attempt to achieve exogenous variation of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county-level, we instrument COVID-19 cases and deaths with the share of employment in meat-processing factories in each county. More specifically, we use the average number of workers in the NAICS industry code 3116, “Animal Slaughtering and Processing,” in each county between 2012 and 2015, i.e., before Trump’s presidency. We divide this number by the average number of total workers in each country during the same time frame, i.e., 2012–2015. Data come from the CBP and measure raw employment. The rationale for the instrument is that there is evidence of meat-processing plants becoming COVID-19 hotbeds due to their cold, humid environment and difficulties with workplace physical distancing.17 According to a CDC report on July 10, among 23 states reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and poultry facilities, 16,233 cases in 239 facilities occurred, including 86 (0.5%) COVID-19-related deaths.18 Based on cases reported by Johns Hopkins University, as of May 6, counties containing or within 15 miles of one or more meatpacking plants reported 373 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents.19 That is roughly double the US average of 199 cases per 100,000 in all counties with reported cases.20 The severity of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in meat-processing facilities prompted research on how to control the spread of the virus in these plants.21 Armed with this instrument, we estimate: where MEATc is the share of workers in meat-processing plants. We run a first stage in which we regress this variable on the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants at the county level, including all controls and state fixed effects as in Eq. 1. Then we plug in the predicted values of this first stage and estimate the second stage of the 2SLS. For our instrument to be valid two conditions have to hold. First, our instrument has to be a strong predictor of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories since the beginning of the pandemic for the (1) top 1% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories. This figure illustrates the cumulative number of number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories for the (1) top 1% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. Employment data is from the County Business Patterns This figure provides direct evidence that counties with a higher share of employment in meat-processing factories had a higher incidence of COVID-19 during the entire pandemic. COVID-19 case (and death) incidence is much larger for counties with a relatively high share of employment in meat-processing factories and much smaller for counties with no employment or positive employment share. This result suggests our first stage is strong and that the relationship between the share of employment in meat-processing factories and COVID-19 incidence is non-linear. Note also that the raw correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument is 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. The correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument conditional on controls and state fixed effect is much higher, i.e., above 0.5 for cases and 0.3 for deaths. Second, the identifying variance is the industrial composition of each county, specifically the presence of meat-processing factories. In order for our instrument to allow a causal interpretation, employment in meat-processing factories must only affect the change in voting behavior from 2016 to 2020 through its effect on COVID-19 cases and deaths, i.e., the exogeneity assumption. While there is no test to assess the validity of this assumption, we discuss other possible channels through which our instrument can affect the outcome variable and explain how we account for these channels. While we control for a host of variables that could potentially affect the exclusion restriction, we discuss here two main possible violations of the exogeneity assumption. First, we control for the share of manufacturing employment. We do so because it may be that counties with a large share of workers in manufacturing voted against Trump in 2020 due to job losses for which he was now held accountable as the incumbent president. It may also be that trade unions were more actively campaigning against Trump in 2020 than they were in 2016, since he was the incumbent Republican president. In an effort to isolate the effect of our instrument on COVID-19 cases, we also include the share of workers in food manufacturing, i.e., NAICS industry code 311, to which “Animal Slaughtering and Processing” belongs. Including this variable implies that every possible violation of the exclusion restriction has to be specific to the meat-processing industry. In the same spirit, we are concern that Trump policies—both those related and those unrelated to trade—did not specifically affect meat packaging industry. We thus include the China trade shock variable, which captures the vulnerability of US manufacturing counties to foreign competition especially from China.22Autor et al. (2020) show that the China trade shock increased Trump’s vote in 2016 and, in the same vein, it could have decreased his electoral support in 2020 as the incumbent president. Second, it may be that Trump’s trade policies have negatively affected meat sales, and in turn this could have led to a loss of support among workers in this industry and in surrounding communities. Kim and Margalit (2021) provide evidence of that. For addressing this concern, we include variables capturing the potential impact of Chinese tariffs and US tariffs on the workforce in each county.23 Note also that the correlation between our instrument and the share of manufacturing employment and share of employment in food manufacturing is 0.3 and 0.4 respectively, whereas the correlation between our instrument and the other controls is never higher than 0.1.24 In Appendix Table 8, we provide empirical evidence that COVID-19 incidence is significantly related to votes for Trump in 2016 and 2020. We then provide evidence that COVID-19 incidence in our models is not successfully predicting changes in voting behavior for previous presidential elections. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). In panel A (B), the dependent variable is the vote share for Trump in the 2020 (2016) presidential election, whereas the dependent variable in panel C is the change in votes for Trump from 2012 to 2016. Columns 1 and 4 include only state fixed effects and our demographic controls, while columns 2 and 3 sequentially add socioeconomic controls and our social distancing indicator. Placebo analysis using previous presidential elections Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Each point estimate is from a different regression. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2020 (OLS). In panel B, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2016 (OLS). In panel C, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (OLS). In panel D, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (2SLS). In panel E, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2012 and 2008 (2SLS). In panel F, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2008 and 2004 (2SLS). The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes The estimates in panels A and B are positive and significant, suggesting that counties with more Trump’s supporters had larger numbers of COVID-19 cases. The fact that both estimates are positive and significant for both the 2016 and the 2020 presidential elections suggest that this model is misspecified and that a naïve estimation would conclude that COVID-19 incidence helped Trump during the 2020 presidential election.25 In contrast, the estimates are imprecisely estimated and statistically insignificant in all columns in panel C, suggesting that using the differential in voting is more appropriate than using the vote share for the current elections. We also provide placebo evidence that our IV method leads to null findings for previous presidential elections. The estimates are presented in panels D, E, and F. The dependent variables are respectively the differential in vote share for the Republican Party for the elections in 2016 and 2012 (panel D), in 2012 and 2008 (panel E), and in 2008 and 2004 (panel F). The point estimates for COVID-19 cases are all statistically insignificant and much smaller than our 2SLS estimates for 2016–2020. These results provide evidence that our empirical models are properly specified. In this section, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 incidence on voting behavior using OLS and 2SLS. We focus on COVID-19 cases in the main analysis. We note again that our analysis and choice of control variables were fully detailed in our pre-analysis plan. Table 2 contains OLS estimates of Eq. 1 (columns 1–3). The sample size is 2689 observations (i.e., counties).26 The dependent variable is the differential in vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and 2016. A positive value indicates that Trump received more votes in 2020 than in 2016. We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. The variables of interest are the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The impact of COVID-19 cases: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county (n = 2, 689). Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019 What clearly emerges is that COVID-19 cases are negatively related to votes for Trump during the 2020 presidential election in comparison to the 2016 election. In column 1, we include state fixed effects and our set of demographic and socioeconomic controls. We find that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 0.12 percentage points on average. The point estimate is statistically significant at about the 10% level. In column 2, we add to the model our indicator of social distancing, i.e., time spent at workplaces in April 2020. Column 3 is our most extensive model specification. We saturate our model with all the previous controls and state fixed effects. In addition, we add to the model the unemployment change from before to during COVID-19. The magnitude of the estimates and statistical significance remain the same. In column 4, we add to the model a quadratic term of COVID-19 cases. The quadratic term of COVID-19 cases is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level, but very small in magnitude (6.10e-08). In contrast, the magnitude and sign of the coefficient of our variable of interest, cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000, remain the same. This result suggests that the negative effect of additional COVID-19 cases on Trump’s 2020 vote share becomes slightly smaller as the number of cases increases. Of note, the coefficient of unemployment change (August 2019 to August 2020) is small and statistically insignificant.27 Our results thus suggest that job losses during the pandemic are not significantly related to voting behavior and that increases in the unemployment rate does not seem to be a major factor behind the negative effect of COVID-19 on the share of votes for Trump. A possible explanation is that job losses are triggered by policies, e.g., lockdowns, implemented by the states, which Trump opposed or at the very least for which Trump cannot be held directly responsible. The coefficients for some of the other control variables are worth discussing (not shown for space consideration). We find that the share of women is strongly negatively correlated with the change in vote share for Trump. Similarly, Trump seems to have lost vote share in counties with a high share of adults aged 25–54. Our OLS results provide suggestive evidence that the pandemic affected the 2020 presidential election. The main concern with our OLS estimates is that omitted variables could be related to both COVID-19 incidence and differential voting behavior in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. We now turn to our instrumental variable strategy. In Table 2 (columns 5–7), we present the first stage (panel A) and the two-stage estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in the first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. We control for our usual set of fixed effects and control variables. As shown in Fig. 3, we find that the share of employment in meat-processing factories is strongly positively correlated with COVID-19 incidence. The coefficient is always significant and the F-statistics indicate no concern of a weak instrument. Our second-stage estimates are presented in the bottom panel (columns 4–6). We find that counties with more COVID-19 cases substantially decreased their vote share for Trump in 2020. The 2SLS estimates are larger than the OLS estimates and suggest that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 1.2 percentage point on average.28 The point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level and robust to the inclusion of our large set of controls and the share of manufacturing employment as well as the share of employment in food manufacturing. So far, our analysis has underscored an important finding: the COVID-19 pandemic costs Trump votes. But is this effect large enough to have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election? To answer this question, we conduct a simple counterfactual exercise to determine the magnitude of the effect by exploring how the composition of votes in a number of closely contested states would have differed if there had been fewer COVID-19 cases. The computation of the counterfactual is based on the coefficient estimate in column 1 of Table 2. For each county, we compute the fraction of total votes that Trump would have received if the number of COVID-19 cases had been X% smaller as − 0.0012 ×COVIDc × X% – i.e., the point estimate of the effect of COVIDc on Trump’s vote share from the OLS estimates, the size of each county’s measured COVID-19 cases, and the scaling factor X%. We next multiply this product by the number of total votes in a county to calculate the number of additional votes that Trump would have received in the counterfactual scenario. We then aggregate these county-level votes into state totals. To allow for the margin of error in our counterfactual calculations, we use the lower and upper bounds of our estimate (i.e., 0.0012), using the 90% confidence interval. We report these bounds in parenthesis. Table 3 presents the results of this counterfactual analysis. Column 1 shows the actual vote margin in favor of Biden in the 2020 election for a set of closely contested states. The three subsequent columns show counterfactual outcomes had COVID-19 cases been 5% or 10% or 20% fewer. Since we find that the COVID incidence decreased Trump’s vote share, the counterfactual analyses for fewer COVID-19 cases correspondingly increase Trump’s counterfactual vote totals. The results in Table 3 show that, ceteris paribus, Trump would have won Michigan in a counterfactual scenario with 20% fewer cases. Trump would have won Pennsylvania with 10% fewer COVID-19 cases. He would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, with 5% fewer COVID-19 cases. Under this last counterfactual, Trump would have been reelected. Even if we consider the lower bound calculations, which are very conservative, Trump would have kept the presidency with 21% fewer cases. Counterfactual outcomes in closely contested states won by Biden The computation of the counterfactual is based on the estimate from the OLS model. An increase in per COVID-19 cases reduces Trump’s share of vote by 0.0012 percentage points (see column 3 in Table 2). The actual outcome in column 2 reports the margin in favor of Biden in each state. Negative values indicate that Biden won the state in 2020. The reported values in columns 3 and 4 are estimated margins in favor of Trump in the counterfactual scenario of fewer COVID-19 cases. The numbers in parentheses are the lower and upper bound on these calculations, using the 90% confidence intervals of our OLS estimate. A positive value in columns 3 or 4 larger than the negative value in column 2 implies that Trump would have won the state We investigate heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 on voting in Table 4. In columns 1 and 2, we first investigate whether the effect of COVID-19 incidence is larger/smaller for states that have implemented a stay-at-home order than for states that did not implement such a policy during the pandemic. Data on stay-at-home order comes from Raifman et al. (2020) and only include directives/orders for the entire state, i.e., did not include guidance or recommendations. Of note, all states without a stay-at-home order are states that Trump won in 2016. Our 2SLS estimates suggest that COVID-19 had a larger effect in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order during the pandemic. This result seems to suggest that if Trump had taken the pandemic more seriously and had placed more emphasis on health and safety issues, he would have lost less electorally and he would have had higher chances to get re-elected. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by state and county characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (Eq. 2). In columns 1 and 2, we restrict the sample to counties in states that implemented a stay-at-home order during the pandemic and counties in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order, respectively. In columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016 for states that Trump and Clinton won, respectively. Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (panel A) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (panel B), respectively. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing Columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016, for Trump’s and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s states separately. We define states as Trump’s or Clinton’s using the electoral votes for the 2016 US presidential election.29 We find that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by those states that he won in the 2016 presidential election. The magnitude of the coefficient is about 50% larger than the magnitude of the coefficient in the entire sample.30 In contrast, the coefficient of COVID-19 cases is small, positive, and not significant in those states that Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election (column 2).31 Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states.32 Our results indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is almost twice as large in swing states as it is in non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. We define a county as “urban” (“rural”) if over (below) 50% of its population was living in an urban area in 2010 (US Census). Our results show that urban counties drive the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote. Indeed, the effect is negative and significant in the urban sample, whereas it is smaller and statistically insignificant in rural counties. In Table 5, we investigate heterogeneity by county demographic characteristics. We find that negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger for countries below the median percentage of residents aged 65 than for counties above the median percentage of residents aged 65. Our estimates also indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger in more racially diverse counties (i.e., those with white population shares below the median). Furthermore, our findings show that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by less educated counties (i.e., those with a below-median share of residents with college degrees), which may help explain Biden’s victory in the Rust Belt. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by demographic characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for the Republican Party in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (2). We restrict the sample to counties: below (column 1) and above (column 2) the median percentage of residents aged 65; below (column 3) and above (column 4) the median percentage of white (non Hispanic) residents; and below (column 5) and above (column 6) the median percentage of residents who attended college. The variable of interest is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic, and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing  We now check whether our results are robust to the use of COVID-19 deaths instead of cases. Table 6 shows our estimates. We do not find any evidence that COVID-19 deaths are related to changes in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election with our OLS model. The estimates are all statistically insignificant. For our 2SLS estimates, our first stage is weaker than for cases, with F-statistics ranging from 2 in the less parsimonious model to 6 in our model with the full set of controls. The 2SLS estimates are all negative and of similar magnitude as our 2SLS estimates for cases, but more imprecise with only the estimate in column 6 being statistically significant at conventional levels. The impacts of COVID-19 deaths: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing The fact that our 2SLS estimates are of about the same magnitude for cases and deaths suggests that our conclusions are similar when using deaths instead of cases. Nonetheless, two differences are worth mentioning. First, our instrumental variable is only weakly related to COVID-19 deaths.33 The probability that a COVID-19 infection results in death rises dramatically with age, and we expect that this and other factors such as healthcare coverage may contribute to the divergence in estimated effects. Second, it is plausible that voters are less aware or less likely to know someone who has died of COVID-19 than to know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  One of the defining outcomes of the 2020 presidential election was the record-high turnout. Both presidential candidates would had won any previous elections, given their number of votes at the national-level. We use differences in total votes between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections as a rough proxy of turnout. We run the same model specification as in Eqs. 1 and 2. We show the results in Table 7. The impact of COVID-19 cases on total votes: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–3 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 4–6 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 4–6). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in total votes from 2016 to 2020. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing We find no evidence that COVID-19 cases affected voters’ mobilization in the OLS estimates.34 On the contrary, there is some evidence that the incidence of COVID-19 boosts turnout in the 2SLS. These conflicting results on the effect of the pandemic on mobilization are also found in previous studies that explore this topic in different electoral contexts (Giommoni and Loumeau 2020; Fernández-Navia et al. 2020).35  We provide many robustness checks for our 2SLS results in Baccini et al. (2020). For instance, we add to the models well-known predictors of voting behavior or COVID-19 incidence. We show that our results are robust to controlling for the China shock variable (Autor et al. (2020)) and two variables capturing Chinese tariffs and protection by US tariffs at the county-level from Kim and Margalit (2021). The rationale for including these variables has been explained in the previous section. We also show that our estimates are robust to the inclusion of weather controls such as precipitation and air pollution (i.e., PM2.5 and precipitation for the first months of the pandemic),36 the share of employment in nursing care facilities,37 county-to-county (in and out) migration, and the duration (in days) of the following statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for out-of-state individuals.38 Overall, the inclusion of one or all of these control variables has no effect on the magnitude and significance of our 2SLS estimates. We also check whether our OLS and 2SLS point estimates vary if we change the date for the moment in which we calculate the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. As stated in our pre-analysis plan, we rely on October 22nd for our main analysis. In a set of robustness checks, we instead rely on July 1st, August 1st, September 1st, and August 1st. The estimates for the OLS are all larger and more significant than for our baseline, i.e., cases as of October 22nd, suggesting that we are very conservative in estimating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the differential in votes for Trump. For the 2SLS, the point estimates all range from − 0.011 to − 0.013 and are statistically significant at the 1% level. Similarly, changing the start period to April or May, i.e., excluding cases that occurred early on in the pandemic, has no impact on our conclusions. Last, we show that our conclusions are robust to using a different geographical level for the analysis. In Baccini et al. (2020), we replicate our main analysis using commuting zones as our unit of analysis. Commuting zones are significantly larger than counties, which provides the advantage that the distribution of employment in the meat-processing industry is less limited geographically, since many commuting zones have at least one meat-processing factory.39 This paper explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election using both a reduced form and IV approach. Our key finding is that COVID-19 cases decreased electoral support for Trump. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have been reelected. We find that the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential elections, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that worsening economic conditions reduced electoral support for Trump. The 2SLS estimates show evidence that COVID-19 cases affect positively voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. At least two explanations are consistent with these findings. First, voters may have electorally sanctioned Trump for how he handled the pandemic, which was at odds with most major countries, and widely criticized. This explanation is consistent with a retrospective voting approach (Fiorina 1981; Fearon 1999; Norpoth 2001), in which voters sanction incumbents for their handling of negative shocks. Second, some voters may have switched from Trump to Biden due to changes in preferences triggered by the pandemic and the recession. In particular, a severe public health threat and major economic losses may have shifted preferences in favor of an expansion of the social safety net, including healthcare and unemployment insurance programs (Rees-Jones et al. 2020b). Since the Democratic Party is more likely to champion these policies, Biden benefited from this switch in voters’ preferences. This explanation is in line with studies claiming that political preferences are shaped by personal experience. If it is true that these changes in preferences are long lasting (Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014), the Democratic Party may be able to capitalize electorally in future elections. Our empirical analysis is unable to tease out which of these two channels is operative; this remains an important task for future research. Future studies should also explore how turnout, which was quite high for the 2020 presidential election but for which granular data is not yet available, influenced the results reported in this paper. Finally, when individual-level survey data become available, it will be important to explore how voter heterogeneity in race, age, and other characteristics conditions voters’ responses to the pandemic.

For the empirical analysis, we follow the specifications and test the hypotheses detailed in our pre-analysis plan (PAP). Our PAP was archived on October 30, 2020, at https://osf.io/xvuzp/, 4 days prior to the Presidential Elections. We relied on a PAP to minimize issues of specification searching and p-hacking. Another advantage of relying on a PAP is that it allowed us to think carefully about the analyses to be conducted prior to the outcome of the Presidential Elections. This is potentially important given the growing concerns that social science researchers may be politically biased. We aimed to follow the PAP to the greatest extent possible, but made some modifications following suggestions from other researchers and reviewers, and gaining access to the voting data. We try to be as transparent as possible and list all the modifications made to the pre-analysis plan and supplementary analyses not included in the PAP in Baccini et al. (2020).

(2020) for a review of studies using cellphone data to measure mobility during the pandemic. 12Data can be purchased from https://uselectionatlas.org/BOTTOM/store_data.php. 13Of note, Trump won relatively more sparsely populated counties while Biden won relatively more densely populated counties. This explains that the mean of the variable “Trump Voting (2020)” is 63%. Note that our variables and estimates are unweighted throughout. We show that our results are robust to different weighting schemes in Baccini et al. (2020). 14The increase in the unemployment rate was much larger during the months of April and May 2020. Also note that the increase in unemployment does not include workers who are currently employed but are not working due to lockdowns. See Beland et al. (2020) for a discussion. 15We follow our PAP in using October 22, 2020, for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, we check the robustness of our results using other dates for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. See the “3.3 section for more details. 16Relying on different months for the before and during COVID-19 periods has no effect on our conclusion that job losses are not related to differential voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 elections. 17https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/health/meat-processing-plants-coronavirus-intl/index.html(consulted on October 5, 2020). 18https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6927e2.htm (consulted on October 5 2020). 19News about these cases are distributed by the media across counties and have therefore a general effect, although these news may have more weights in counties with a large share of workers employed in meat-processing plants. 20https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-ratehttps://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-rate(consulted on October 5 2020). 21https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilitieshttps://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilities(consulted on October 5, 2020). 22The China shock variable is a Bartik measure capturing rising Chinese imports to the USA in each industry i, weighted by baseline share of workers in the same industry i in each county. This variable varies both across counties and over time. The over-time variation is given by the difference in imports from China to the USA between 2000 (i.e., pre-accession to the WTO) to the period 2016–2019 (i.e., average value over this 4-year window). 23These variables are built by matching the list of targeted commodities (by China and the USA) to industry classifications and constructing an original measure of the county-level share of employment targeted in each round of retaliatory tariffs. Data come from Kim and Margalit (2021). 24We also implemented the plausibly exogenous test as suggested by Conley et al. (2012). The result of the test, which is available upon request, shows that our instrument is plausibly exogenous with p < 0.1. In other words, the effect of the instrumented variable, i.e., cases, remains negative with a 90% confidence interval. 25Press analyses indicate a positive correlation between COVID-19 cases and Trump’s support. See for instance, “Counties with worst virus surges overwhelmingly voted Trump” by AP news, available at https://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebfhttps://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebf. 26We lose about 400 observations (i.e., counties) because of lack of data for our social distancing indicator. Excluding this control variable and doing the analysis on the full set of counties has no effect on our main conclusions. 27Using the change in unemployment for different dates does not affect our conclusions. For instance, measuring unemployment during the first wave of COVID-19 (i.e., April 2020) instead of the month of August 2020 leads to similar estimates and has no effect on the magnitude or significance of the COVID-19 cases variable. 28There are many plausible explanations for why our 2SLS estimates are larger than our OLS estimates. First, there is a great deal of measurement error in our estimation. Second, we are estimating a local average treatment effect (LATE) with our IV estimation. Voting behavior in counties with relatively more employment in meat-processing factories may be differently affected by the pandemic than counties with no or a small share of employment in this industry. For instance, counties with employment in meat-processing factories are significantly more populous than counties without any jobs in this industry. 29We classify Maine as a blue state. This has no effect on our conclusions. 30The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants varies across Trump’s states (271) and Clinton’s states (166). 31We also tested the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in red states, for states with and without stay-at-home order. Our 2SLS estimates suggest a large negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote for both sets of red states, but that the effect is larger for states without stay-at-home orders. 32We classify states as swing or non-swing using the NYT classification available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/electoral-college-battleground-states.html, consulted on November 2, 2020. We consider swing states as states categorized as tossup and leaning Democratic: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. 33There is a very small differences in death per capita since mid-September 2020 for counties with and without employment in meat-processing factories. 34We also find no evidence that the quadratic terms for COVID-19 deaths are related to Trump vote share in 2020 in comparison to 2016. 35We also investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases on the number of votes for Trump and the Democratic Party separately. The estimates are presented in Baccini et al. (2020). We do not find evidence that COVID-19 is related to the number of votes for Trump in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our OLS and 2SLS models. But we do find some evidence that COVID-19 cases are positively and significantly related to total votes for the Democratic Party in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our 2SLS models. 36A number of studies provide suggestive evidence that air pollution may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death (Wu et al. 2020). 37http://jedkolko.com/2020/10/18/the-geography-of-the-covid19-third-wave/ (consulted on November 2, 2020). 38Note that we only have data for statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions. One exception is for stay-at-home orders, which have been implemented by some cities and counties prior to statewide orders. Typically, the city or county order precedes the statewide order by few days. 39Our first stage F-statistics at the commuting zone-level are smaller than at the county-level, ranging around 10. The magnitude of the first stage coefficients is larger at the commuting zone-level than at the county-level, suggesting that COVID infections spread to neighboring counties.

,,Voters of color aren't happy with Biden. But we're not rushing to Trump's camp.,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently announced its latest tactic for electoral dominance: a $35 million campaign to “persuade and mobilize” voters of color to help them win back the U.S. House in November. It’s called ""P.O.W.E.R. (Persuade. Organize. Welcome. Educate. Reach.) The People,"" and it’s the largest expenditure for this purpose in recent memory. The move draws the latest battle line in the Democratic Party's crusade against the Republican Party and, by symbolic extension, former President Donald Trump. Yet, this desperate measure belies a subtler reality: President Joe Biden has become incredibly bad at marketing himself to voters of color. Although the president achieved an electoral victory in part with the help of those voters, his support is eroding: A recent NBC News poll found Black opposition to Biden growing from 12% in 2020 to 20% in November. A New York Times poll found a similar trend, with 22% of Black voters in six of the most important battleground states now supporting Trump. To those befuddled by this development, there’s only one question to ask: What did you expect? As a voter of color, I’m not convinced that the Democratic Party cares about anything besides stoking racial divisions to grab my vote − and its $35 million appeal hasn’t changed my mind. As strange as it might sound in the current political landscape in which both parties’ candidates advertise their primary quality as ""not being the other,"" the concept of earning votes actually matters to me and millions of other voters. To me, here’s how the Democratic Party's latest gambit sounds: “Let’s buy minorities’ votes, because we can’t procure votes through our actions.” But trying to buy votes you haven’t earned is not the strategy of a party worth moral consideration. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., diagnoses Biden’s woes as tactical: “My problem is that we have not been able to break through that MAGA wall in order to get to people exactly what this president has done.” This may well be part of the problem − although 20% support for Trump is hardly an insurmountable wall − but it’s not the main problem. Radio host Charlamagne tha God laid out his 2024 trilemma for Politico: Voters' options are “the cowards, the crooks and the couch.” Third-party candidates:Are you paying attention to the GOP primaries? You're missing the real campaign news. Minority support might be turning away from Biden, but we’re not exactly running en masse to the Trump camp. It’s not just a thin-but-loud MAGA wall the Democrats have to fight against: It’s also the strong urge to stay home in November, instead of throwing votes behind an incumbent who seems incapable of demonstrating the kind of care that a worthy candidate − or a presidential president − should be expressing. The Democrats, for whatever reason, cannot internalize this. They have instead opted to spend money without a meaningful strategy, execute a poor strategy to bad results, generate more money to “fix” bad results, rinse and repeat. Voters are desperate for something different − like a president capable of putting action to lofty words. I would like my president to both condemn white supremacy and refrain from hurling racially charged insults at Americans of color who commit the unpardonable sin of not voting for him. 2024 presidential election:New year will show us what America wants to be. Our USA TODAY Opinion team is hopeful – and worried. No American voter, regardless of color, is a prize to be won by hitting the right donation threshold. Because of this failure, as per the Charlamagne trilemma, the Democratic Party is losing voters to the couch. As of now, Democratic leaders have given us no compelling reason to save them from their fate.

,,Some Michigan Jews Aim to Pressure Biden on Israel by Voting ‘Uncommitted’ in the Primary,"  (JTA) – About two dozen progressive Jewish activists tuned into the “MI Jews Uncommitted Phone Bank” this week, ready to ask their networks not to vote for President Joe Biden. Their virtual phone bank, held ahead of Michigan’s Feb. 27 primary, was unlike any other. Instead of a get-out-the-vote campaign, this crew would be better described as don’t-get-out-the-vote.  Upset with Biden’s stalwart support for Israel in its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and with the tens of thousands of Palestinian casualties, most of them civilians, these Jews want to use their moment at the ballot box to force the president to change course.  The campaign subscribes to the view that Israel’s actions constitute genocide, a charge common among pro-Palestinian activists that Israel and the United States strenuously deny. Israel says it is not intentionally targeting civilians and blames Hamas for embedding among and beneath them. “As Michigan Jews, we are important messengers in a multiracial and multi-faith, anti-war coalition telling President Biden that we are uncommitted to his administration’s funding of genocidal war in Gaza,” a mission statement reads. The Jews backing the Uncommitted campaign — which is also called Listen to Michigan — are part of a fast-growing movement, initiated by local Arab American activists, that hopes to send a message to the White House about its Israel policy. And they think the swing state’s new early primary slot gives them a perfect chance to do so. “I think that there is an assumption from the Biden administration, as well as many others in power, that they can count on Jewish support and the Jewish vote as things carry on in this way in Gaza,” Eleanor Gamalski, a local Jewish organizer who headed up the phone bank, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. “Many Jews that I know would object to that.” Gamalski is the deputy director of Detroit Jews for Justice, a social justice nonprofit, and a onetime staffer for Andy Levin, the Jewish former Democratic congressman and member of a Michigan political dynasty. But her participation in the Uncommitted campaign is on her own behalf. She’s a longtime friend of Abbas Alawieh, a Lebanese American Democratic strategist who helped launch the campaign alongside Layla Elabed, sister of Detroit Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American and the House’s most vocal Israel critic.  To Gamalski, the movement seemed like a perfect opportunity to push for policies her progressive Jewish network wants: namely, a ceasefire in Gaza, an exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian security prisoners, and a commitment “to stop sending U.S. weapons and dollars to fund this genocide.” Michigan is one of a handful of key swing states that helped determine the last two presidential elections, in one case by a razor-thin margin: Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by only about 10,000 votes. The Uncommitted campaign hopes to demonstrate it has at least that number of supporters, a large enough bloc to potentially swing the state and force Biden’s attention.  Campaign organizers declined to tell JTA how many people had signed its pledge. But Arab and Muslim Americans have been warning for months that their communities could withhold their votes from Biden over Gaza. With an estimated more than 300,000 Arab Americans in the state along with assorted allies, the 10,000 mark seems plausible to reach. (Getting to Biden’s margin of victory in 2020, more than 150,000, would be more difficult.) At least some Jewish voters will be part of the count — including, possibly, Levin himself. He told JTA he’s backing the Uncommitted campaign precisely because he wants to ensure Biden takes Michigan in November. He doesn’t think the president’s current course on Israel will cut it: not just for Arab and Muslim Americans, but also for other constituencies like Black churches, which have become increasingly vocal in their calls for a ceasefire. “I’m betting on Joe Biden to find a way to become a peacemaker in Israel and Palestine, so that people can vote for him later,” Levin said. “I feel like this is existential for Joe Biden’s political survival. I don’t see how he wins reelection without winning Michigan, and I don’t see how he wins Michigan without changing course.” Levin isn’t the only big progressive voice supporting the campaign. Our Revolution, an activist group founded by progressive Jewish Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016 and currently chaired by Jewish labor activist Larry Cohen, also announced this week that it would encourage its 87,000 Michigan followers to vote Uncommitted to “push Biden to change course on Gaza now.”  Michigan is also home to a Jewish community of around 100,000, and its big Jewish institutions and personalities — including Temple Israel, the nation’s largest Reform congregation, as well as a politically connected yeshiva and a former president of AIPAC — remain staunchly pro-Israel. A poll from November showed that most American Jews back Biden’s approach to the conflict, and previous polls have shown that most U.S. Jews have an affinity for Israel. The Detroit JCRC/AJC, the local federation’s community relations arm, told JTA it would not be issuing any public comment on the Uncommitted campaign. And the campaign is new enough that some major figures in the state’s Jewish community told JTA they had not heard a lot about it — though they were not happy about what they learned. “Any effort that takes votes away from Joe Biden will only benefit Donald Trump, and job one is to make sure he doesn’t become president,” Mark Jacobs, a local liberal AIPAC supporter who also co-founded the Detroit Coalition for Black and Jewish Unity, told JTA. Jacobs — who has done significant outreach to Detroit-area Black churches since the outbreak of war on Oct. 7 and is preparing to launch a leadership academy this month for Black and Jewish teenagers — didn’t know about the Uncommitted campaign; he said he wasn’t speaking on behalf of the coalition or AIPAC. When he found out about the campaign, Jacobs said he didn’t think a successful Uncommitted initiative would change many Jewish votes in Michigan, even if Biden took a more aggressive posture toward Israel as a result of the pressure. “Arguably, there may be a sliver of Jewish voters who are a bit on the fence about Biden and maybe if he becomes more vocal during the political season, saying things that are not embraced by many members of the Jewish community, then that could have an impact to some extent,” he said. “But I’m just so fixated on the god-awful harm that would be caused by a Trump presidency.”  Few are as familiar with navigating intra-Jewish politics in the state as Levin himself, who lost a primary race for his redrawn House seat in 2022 after pro-Israel groups unhappy with his policies spent more than $4 million to back his non-Jewish opponent over him. Still, Levin insisted, Biden “doesn’t have to worry about the Jewish vote, I don’t think.” In an acknowledgement of the growing pressure on him regarding Israel, Biden’s team met recently with Arab leaders in the state to apologize for “missteps” in his handling of the war, including not more forcefully advocating for Palestinian lives. Alawieh said he interpreted this as referring to the president’s public statements, not his actual Israel policies.  “Senior Biden officials were talking about the mistakes as more of a messaging problem,” Alawieh told reporters during a Listen to Michigan press briefing last week. “But what was absent from what they were saying was any commitment to push even privately for a ceasefire that saves lives.” Asked by JTA what it would take for him to come back around on Biden before November, Alawieh said he wanted to see the president “apply the most basic levels of accountability to condition military funding” to Israel. Elabed said she would need to see “a permanent ceasefire” before she would even consider voting for Biden. Many in Michigan and beyond aren’t thrilled with the campaign’s goals. “This is how Trump becomes president again,” reads a typical comment on the Listen to Michigan Instagram, a concern also echoed by Michigan’s popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.  “A potential second term for the former president would be very hard on all the communities that are still being impacted by what’s happening overseas as well, and that’s something that shouldn’t be lost on people’s calculation, too,” Whitmer told reporters Thursday. Gamalski rejects that argument. “I think the Biden administration, if they are to lose to Trump in November, it’s because of the choices that they have made and the courage they failed to exhibit in standing up to the weapons industry and in calling for a stop to this war,” she said.  Organizers insist the campaign only applies to the primary (in contrast to another local campaign, Abandon Biden, encouraging Michigan voters to stay home altogether in November). Yet many members are noncommittal about how they’ll vote in the general. One of Listen to Michigan’s Instagram posts suggests the campaign could hurt Biden more than just symbolically.  “Uncommitted is the best strategy because it not only takes votes away from Biden but removes delegates from him if we can get to a 15% threshold,” the post reads. “If Biden doesn’t get enough delegates nationally he doesn’t get the nomination.” And then there’s the fact that some of the loudest voices pushing for an Uncommitted vote have also praised Hamas or downplayed the extent of the atrocities it committed on Oct. 7. Osama Siblani, publisher of the Arab American News, headquartered in Dearborn, said at an October rally, “We are not going to be intimidated by staying silent when they say Hamas is a terrorist organization.” He was in the meeting with Biden officials and has endorsed the Uncommitted campaign, saying, “Vote for anyone you want to vote for, but don’t vote for Biden because he is complacent in the crime against Palestinians.” The Jews backing the campaign acknowledge the presence of views like Silbani’s but say it doesn’t change their support. Levin said it’s “all the more reason to get in there and hold up a banner of integrity and of sanity,” to prove that not everyone backing a ceasefire is a Hamas supporter. Gamalski chooses to focus on the ways in which she does feel kinship with the campaign’s organizers.  “It’s really evident to me that the folks organizing this are concerned about bringing about a better future for everyone, including Jews,” she said. “I know that folks in this coalition have shown up for me and spoken out against antisemitism, and they don’t compartmentalize their work on any one oppression. And so I knew right away that I was in good company.” Log In   ",www.thejewishnews.com,https://www.thejewishnews.com/jewish-telegraphic-agency/some-michigan-jews-aim-to-pressure-biden-on-israel-by-voting-uncommitted-in-the-primary/article_edfa7dbc-cff4-11ee-bce7-f7ce6badf5be.html,,
,,Unlawful ‘malarkey’ robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home on primary day,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        E-Edition TRENDING: A robocall disturbing New Hampshire voters’ weekend calm is the AI election meddling everyone’s been predicting. The message spoofing the voice of President Biden and instructing people not to vote in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary is now under investigation, Gov. Chris Sununu told the Herald in Windham, N.H. Many Granite State voters’ phones rang early Sunday to a voice sounding suspiciously like the 46th president and employing his trademark “no malarkey” phrase. The fake commander-in-chief then went on to tell voters they should save their electoral energy for November’s general election. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the apparently AI-generated Biden voice told callers. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” Sununu, who was making the rounds Monday with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in an attempt to get out the vote before the primary, said that he’s aware of the call and that those responsible will be held accountable. “Our attorney general will completely look into it and into who is behind it. We have rules and laws in place,” he said. Sununu said the call violated state law and is “election interference.” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella’s Office seemed to agree. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely. Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election,” they wrote. Biden’s name will not appear on Tuesday’s ballot, after his campaign and the Democratic National Committee attempted to delay the New Hampshire primary in favor of starting the election cycle in South Carolina. The party was adamant about the issue, warning New Hampshire delegates may be disqualified if they went against party wishes. However, Granite State law says their election must occur before any other. The compromise was Biden sitting out the first primary, with efforts made to add his name as a write-in, and the state’s delegates potentially forfeit at the party’s convention. The DNC even went so far as to tell the state party’s chairman he should inform voters the primary was “meaningless,” only to have Formella’s office respond with a cease and desist order.

,,Why This Group of Undecided Independent Voters Is Leaning Toward Trump,"What can President Biden say and do to win over undecided voters? What concerns and arguments will draw these voters to Donald Trump? For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we spoke with 13 undecided independent voters from across the country about how they see the two leading presidential candidates and explored some issues that might affect how they vote in November. To a striking degree, most of the participants tilted toward Mr. Trump, even though they disliked his personality. So why did they lean toward Mr. Trump? As you’ll read below, almost all the voters (who range in age from 22 to 64) were most worried about the economy and how their groceries and other bills were too costly. Some were also deeply troubled by the crisis at the southern border, and some were concerned about the Israel-Gaza war and disliked U.S. aid to other countries. The participants’ comments indicated that most did not feel they were in good hands with Mr. Biden or trust that they would be, using words like “senile,” “unfit” and “disingenuous” to describe him. And while the group viewed Mr. Trump negatively, some people suggested that the country was on its toes more with him in office. “At least Donald Trump started a conversation. Sure, it was divisive, and sure, it really wasn’t the most productive, but it really highlighted problems and the divisiveness that was already hidden inside of our country,” said Yalena, a 22-year-old Latina from Alabama. At the same time, she described experiencing more racism while Mr. Trump was president, including an ugly incident while dining out with her mother. These seeming contradictions came up with other matters as well; there was concern about the future of abortion rights yet skepticism that Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump would be any different on the issue. Many didn’t seem to understand the Democratic president’s views on abortion. If there was one takeaway, it’s that Mr. Biden has his work cut out for him to win over these voters. Fill in the blank: When I think about how things are going in the country right now, I’m most worried about: blank. The economy. Education. Inflation. Economy. Economy. Economy. Foreign policy. My child’s future. Economy. Where the government’s money’s going. Affordable housing. Education. Division of people Tell me more about the economy. When you chose that word, what were you thinking about? Inflation, interest rates. We’ve gone through a very big change in what is considered normal for interest rates. And I worry about government spending. How long have you been concerned about these things? Probably since Covid, around when we started Covid stimulus. I feel the same way. Ever since Covid, I keep hearing the government say that things are getting better. I’d like to know who they’re asking, because I don’t see the economy getting better. I see us spending more money in our households, in the government. Here in New Hampshire, it’s never been this bad, ever. What specifically are you thinking about? Our daily living, our cost of living. They’re spending billions and billions of dollars on stuff that I don’t understand. Where is that going? It is atrocious that our money is not going to education, health care, equipping us to withstand future troubles. I’m now noticing that the housing prices are decreasing significantly each month. Houses that were priced $50,000 above are now really drastically cutting their prices, so we’re going in the right direction somewhat. Inflation got better. Stocks rebounded a bit. Prices stopped growing like crazy like it used to be a year ago. I can’t agree at all with Pavel. That may be his experience, and I hope it is. In the last few months I’ve seen prices going up 10 percent, 15 percent over the last price, week by week. I go to the grocery store with my budget, and now I have to eat even worse quality food. That’s all I can afford. How about gas? How are gas prices where you are? I think in the last week, the gas prices went up here. My thing is education. Cost of tuition and with three kids in college at once, it was a big ticket for me. The cost of the tuition keeps going up every year, and the kids come out of school with a lot of debt. So that loan forgiveness, where’s that? I’m currently in college. I wanted to get my master’s, but it’s like I’m never going to be able to afford it. Where is the government’s money going? It should be going toward stuff like education. I’m never going to see loan forgiveness. I just see myself in debt forever. It seems to me like businesses are sort of in cahoots to inflate prices intentionally. Covid kind of reshaped our norm. We kept interest rates pinned way too low for too long. And then the Covid stimulus. I know we needed to do something during Covid, but I don’t think it went into all the right hands. What’s the word that describes how you feel about the upcoming election? Lost. Disaster. Necessary. Stressed. Anxious. Are we allowed to curse or no? Bullshit. Anxiety. Worried. Indifferent. Ugh. Abyss. Concerned. Disaster Kim, tell me why you said “anxious.” Because, given where we are as a country, I don’t know how this is going to go. You may think the best person is going to win, and then a curveball is thrown. I’ve seen huge upsets before, and that makes me very anxious. If the wrong person gets into office, where are we going to go? I feel like for the first time in my lifetime, both parties don’t represent a majority of Americans’ interests and so it doesn’t really matter who wins it. Yeah. Like no matter who gets voted into office, I think our options suck either way, and I don’t really see any progress. I said “indifferent.” It comes from the same sentiment that everyone was sharing. None of the people that are in office remotely reach the standards of what the American people need for them to lead them. All these people have the same agenda. When you say no matter who it is, they’re going to have the same agenda, do you feel like both candidates or any potential candidate, they all have the same agenda as each other? I wouldn’t say the same agenda as each other, but I definitely would say that their best interest has never been the American people. Joe Biden and Donald Trump, they both had opportunities to show us that. Donald Trump did a better job. Joe Biden, I mean, I feel like I don’t have a president. Gary, you said “abyss.” Well, the first thing that came to my mind was a phrase from the Talking Heads: “same as it ever was.” And I think that’s what these other people are saying, too. We’re stuck. How so? It’s like we’re looking over the edge of a cliff. We might fall off, and we can’t see the bottom. We can’t see anything. Ken, tell me why “bullshit.” Ever since Barack Obama left office — whether you feel what he did was right or wrong or whether you feel indifferent, he had a vision for what he saw as the American dream and trajectory to be going. With Trump, we lost a shared vision of where we’re going. Now it’s so divisive, whether it’s social media or actual general media, there’s only the left side, the right side. There’s no clear path between the two to accomplish what everyone’s wanting to see happen. Richard, you said “necessary.” We do this every four years. You make your choice as best you can from the pool that’s out there. You’ve got two parties. And you go online, the platforms are on the websites of both parties. You can see what they want to do for the next four years, so that’s what we all should be looking at. To me, it’s less about the person. A couple of people said they’re concerned the candidates are not going in the direction that most people want to go in. What direction do you all want to go in? People want to stop seeing the debt ceiling climb and climb. We’re at $34 trillion. We want to be responsible with our fiscal spending. We want to see a net positive trajectory of how we’re tackling our debt. We’re sending money to Ukraine, Israel, what have you, but what about the things here? What we should be getting to is a more united people. Shouldn’t our focus be on our country right now? That’s the direction we should be taking. We’ve given enough to all the other countries to help them. We’re going down fast and hard. I’m going to give you a list of five issues: the economy, immigration and the border, abortion and abortion rights, protecting democracy, and the conflict between Israel and Gaza. So except for Ken, everyone has a hand up for the economy. Ken, what was your No. 1? Israel and Gaza. I served nine years in the U.S. Army, and I see that we’re getting closer and closer to World War III. But no one seems super concerned that we’re putting our nose in, and we’re getting attacked by Yemen and Iran, and we’re increasing our military power inside of the Middle East again. We’re scratching at the door between two, three superpowers. Folks who picked the economy, tell me why. I guess it’s a combination. The economy affects everything — housing, education. My main concern is big business and the increase of inflation. I’m not sure there’s a whole lot you can do about big businesses and what they do, since they control the politicians. I just feel that we’re headed to another 2008, which is going to be much worse than it was back then. I always think about it. I can appreciate a third party. I don’t think we’re there yet. Kennedy’s had some actual plans for housing infrastructure in the United States, how the government could potentially subsidize fair housing for the general populace. I would be more likely to vote for a third-party candidate if I knew that they had a better chance of actually winning. But it just feels like a wasted, throwaway vote. I feel the same way. It’s a wasted vote. Imagine someone was polling pretty high and actually could win the presidency — what would you want that person to do as president, a person who was not beholden to Democrats or Republicans? Get private money out of the government. Stop lobbying and having corporate dollars influence our election. Just reach across the aisle and stop this grandstanding nonsense. Just compromise. Come to the middle on some of this stuff. Let’s talk about Biden. How would you describe Biden as a person? I’m very young, so I’m going to say what a Gen Z person would say: He’s a little bit senile, and I do think if you can’t do the job, it’s time to step down. How would you describe him as a person? I want to say he means well, but it doesn’t look like it from what he does. Is there something that you’re thinking about? He promised student loan forgiveness, and that never happened. His intentions are good. But with the lobbyists and the big businesses controlling everything, there’s not much going to get done. So I was going to say “puppet.” That’s because I feel like he really tap-dances. I don’t know what he’s done. It just seems like he’s just throwing things out there to please almost anyone. The word that immediately came up was “disingenuous.” Nothing that is said really connects with me. I don’t feel like I’m being told the truth. I don’t feel like I’m being told anything upfront. I was just so disappointed — with the ounce of hope I had left — when we just started pouring money into the Israel conflict. I think he’s unfit for the presidency. A president should be the commander in chief. And he does not appear to be a capable commander in chief. What was it specifically that gave you that impression? To pull out from Afghanistan. That was not wise, and it was rushed. We’re still dealing with those repercussions today. The deal with Iran is not a good one. Now they have loads of cash. So that’s not great. Our ships are parked in the Mediterranean Sea outside Israel, and they’re just outside of Russia’s missiles. So they’re not going to be attacked, probably, but this is going to disrupt prices. It’s going to disrupt oil, energy. These are not smart decisions. What would you name as the biggest accomplishment of the Biden administration? The infrastructure bills that have been passing. I work in that sector, and so there’s a lot of money being pumped into it right now. Has he done anything? Because I haven’t seen it. I think his presidency has been very weak and divisive. But if there’s a positive, I would say the infrastructure as well. For me, economywise, nothing. But I appreciate his support of Ukraine. Yeah, nothing economywise. But he’s done a lot for racial diversity, in appointing Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He has competent people on his staff. I just feel like some of the people that were in the previous president’s inner circle just were really people with questionable character. And the cap on prescription prices, I completely forgot about that one. So that helped a little bit. Is there any policy that President Biden championed or that you associate with him that had a direct impact in terms of helping you or hurting you personally? I would say the housing. My daughters — What has Biden himself done on housing that’s affected you personally? Nothing. And my daughter has nowhere to go because she needs an income of $3,000, $4,000 a month to get an apartment. So she ends up — she’ll be coming here now. OK. And you tie that back more to Biden than to Gov. Chris Sununu or any local politicians? Yes. I attribute it to him. He was with the economy and should have made improvements not just for our state. This is not just our state that’s having this problem. So he released oil from the U.S. reserve to help cut gas prices. That’s a double-edged sword. One, we have cheaper gasoline. But two, that strategic reserve is now not at the same level that it used to be. Think about what you want Biden to talk more about: lowering the cost of groceries and other things or securing the border and tougher immigration rules. I happen to live in a border state. It is not in the news right now, but what I have been hearing and seeing is a conflict between one state or a group of states now that agree with one state versus the federal government. And it’s not productive. It’s going to lead to a not great situation. Richard, is there anything specifically you’d like to hear Biden say or do on that front? I would like him to address that. What’s happening is he’s dealing behind the scenes with Texas and with the governor over there, and that is not productive. In fact, they’re using intimidation on the governor of Texas, and it’s just not productive. If he wants more votes, I think he should say something. I’m with Richard. What’s happening between Texas and the federal government is very dangerous and concerns me. It should not be happening in America. I’m not sure that our country can afford having so many immigrants in a year, if we can digest them, if our economy will be hurt more. I’m a little bit further removed from the immigration as Richard and Pavel are. The major concern in my area is children and families who are not able to afford basic groceries. I work in the public education sector. You have two-income households who cannot afford food. I hate to say it. I don’t understand how the milk went from one price to the other. How many of you want to hear more from Biden on abortion rights? [Nobody raises a hand.] How do you feel about that issue in the election? It’s the states. It’s not the president. I don’t want to hear Biden talking about my abortion. I hate to say, there’s bigger issues besides abortion right now. It’s already been solved. Leave it alone, like they said. For folks in many states, there are bans or partial bans on abortion, or bans are being discussed. Do people feel that it’s important to have a discussion about protecting abortion rights nationally? I mean, yeah, I definitely think it’s important that the states that do have the ban on them to have a conversation. Why are you dictating what a woman is going to do with her body? I just think we’ve allowed it to become this religious vitriol thing where we allow religion to have a say in our policies about health care, especially women’s health care. And I feel like we have not done a good enough job and the government hasn’t done a good enough job at defining abortion as health care. Abortion is not a religious belief, whatever you think. Church and state have done a poor job at staying separated. I’m tired of hearing about it. I mean, I hate to say it. They can do what they want, women. When they have been banned before, they’re going to get an abortion. So I don’t even know why it’s a topic of discussion. Why do you think it’s a topic of discussion? It’s a diversion. Anything to draw out there to get people on one side heated against the other, this is exactly what this is. I bet you we won’t hear any more about this after the election. Who’s doing the diversion? Is it Democrats or Republicans? Is it the Supreme Court? Is it Biden? Is it state government? Well, I don’t even know that it’s a person. I would have to say it would be a group that has a vested interest in control, more control. So we talked about Biden. Now we’re going to talk about Trump. How would you describe Trump as a person? Conceited. Egotistical Self-righteous. Narcissist Disastrous. Flamboyant. Irritating. I was just going to say “crazy.” What are some strengths that he has? He’s very bold, and he’s competitive. I mean, you can say that much about him. Ambitious. What were some of his accomplishments during his presidency? At least Donald Trump started a conversation. Sure, it was divisive, and sure, it really wasn’t the most productive, but it really highlighted problems and the divisiveness that was already hidden inside of our country. At least people were having conversations. At least everything felt more exposed and out there. Can you tell me what those things were that were exposed? Our border. The conversations weren’t productive, but they really brought up the very important subject of funding so people that want to come here legally are able to access us. The infrastructure to support that program has people waiting 15, 20 years to get a legal green card, and that’s just ridiculous. I mean, there needs to be something done about that. I think he really had our economy pushing in the right direction. What did he do to do that? What was the policy or thing that he did? I just saw the flow. It seemed to flow, like the gas or even your shopping or just about anything that mattered to us. It just kind of flowed. It had a better flow. And you got to understand, it’s coming from a person that, I’ve hated this man since I was about 17. I always thought he was a pig. OK? I do. I can’t stand the man. But I voted for him three times. The unemployment rate got down to around 3.5 percent at one point, the lowest in 50 years. And so that was extremely uplifting for many, many groups in the country all at the same time, which was really amazing. I’d never seen that before. Not even during Clinton. If you had to guess, what do you think the unemployment rate is right now? It’s 3.4 percent, isn’t it? Because you’re saying the unemployment rate was very low under Trump. Do you think it was lower then than — Well, I just saw the new jobs report that came out. It is very good. It is very good for the country. As of last month, January, wages did increase. But that was not without a lot of inflation prior to that, with a lot of job losses over the last three years. Other folks, what are Trump’s accomplishments as president? I don’t know the specific numbers, but he was trying to redirect a lot of the manufacturing back here and be less reliant on foreign sources, which I think would be overall good for our future. Not a popular opinion, but Trump did put a pause on student loan payments during the pandemic, and honestly, that actually allowed me to have zero student loan debt. When Trump was president, is there anything that he did as president that had an impact on you personally in a way that either helped you or hurt you? This may sound silly, but I experienced a lot more racism due to him being president. I am fair-skinned, so I don’t look very Hispanic to a lot of people. But a lot of the times I spoke Spanish, people felt the opportunity to be more vocal about their opinion on how they felt about Hispanic people and even to my mother at times. And so I think that was definitely a shock. I had never been in a situation like that, never encountered anyone that felt so emboldened to say something like that. Yalena, may I ask, could you give a specific example of something that happened to you? Yeah. So me and my mom, we were at a pizza restaurant, and the people in the booth next to us did not appreciate that we were speaking Spanish. They called the manager over, and the manager came over to us, and they were like, “Hey, if you can’t speak English, we’re going to have to ask you to leave.” As you can imagine, we left because we felt uncomfortable, and as we were leaving, it was followed up by comments of “Go back to your country,” “Speak English,” “You’re in America.” And so God knows what else they said. I’m so sorry that happened to you and your mom. Thank you for sharing it. Let’s shift gears a bit. Trump is facing 91 criminal indictments. He talks about them a lot. Do you think Trump is talking too much about these criminal indictments that he is facing? [Two participants raise their hands.] Anyone have thoughts about these indictments against Trump and how he talks about them? I don’t think it’s a witch hunt, as he calls it, and I think he violated certain laws. I mean, in even his personal stuff and his sexual abuse. I mean, I trust all those allegations. For anyone, if Trump is convicted in one of these trials, would it make you any more or less likely to vote for him if he’s the Republican nominee? To me, it doesn’t affect anything. His life, he puts it right out there. I’m sick of hearing it, but it’s him. So if I’m going to vote for him, that’s part of what I accept. Lorraine, if he was convicted in one of these cases, would it make you any more or less likely to vote for him? It wouldn’t. I’ve already formed my opinion regarding Trump, so it wouldn’t hurt or help my opinion. Trump talks a lot about the border, saying there’s an invasion underway and he would seal the border if he was re-elected and turn people back. What’s your reaction to how Trump talks about the border? Is he talking about the border too much, not enough, the right way, the wrong way? Yeah, I definitely think it’s an issue and it needs to be dealt with. For whatever reason, it wasn’t highlighted enough until probably more recently. But I think it’s dangerous that he’s — I think by and large, they’re people escaping a bad situation from the country they’re in. They’re not here to commit crimes. And I think it’s really dangerous that he’s drawing a straight line to everyone that’s doing that. We definitely need immigration reform. No doubt it’s a problem. But the way that he goes about it is just going to cause more chaos and violence. Immigration does need to be moderated and monitored. But for every one of those people that come in there, they’re not taking jobs. They’re creating them as well. So for every 20 people or every 500 people, whatever it is, nurses, doctors, policemen, firemen all get new jobs. So it’s not just going one direction. It’s not just hurting the country. Which do you want to hear more about from Trump? How good the economy was when he was in office as president or what he would do with the economy if he’s elected in November? For me at this point, anything Trump said, I don’t buy it at all. It’s a bunch of fluff, a bunch of lies. As far as the economy he’s built, to me, he never built the economy. He just basically piggybacked off what Obama and Joe Biden had done prior to his administration. The only thing he’s really done that I can see significantly is give a big tax cut to the big businesses. I did vote for him in 2016, but I am greatly disappointed. I just think he’s just going to use it as an opportunity to enrich himself. That’s ultimately what it comes down to. He only cares about one person: himself. Last question from me. So what advice would you give to Biden to try to get more undecided voters to vote for him? I don’t know what he could say, in my opinion, just because we’ve been a disaster since he’s been there. Take a look at what’s happening with the economy. Look at it for real with your eyes and not all your people around you. I agree with Robin. I think he’s controlled. I think he needs to be more of his own mind and speak freely more from himself. I think more heartfelt as a person. I don’t get that from him. I mean, he’s not inspiring at all. There’s not much you could basically tell him other than just come up with great policies for the country. I’d just tell him to stop messing around and just shoot me straight with what his intentions are. What’s the thing that you feel he’s not being straight on? Just their plans on what they’re trying to accomplish in office. I feel like I was promised a lot. Natalie shared student loan forgiveness, and lo and behold, it’s not here. Why do you think that’s happened? What’s your sense of what happened with student loans? I’m not so sure, I just know that it didn’t happen. But when I see billions of dollars going across the sea, I’m like, “Well, I could have used a couple of those billion dollars to clear my $15,000 of student loan debt.” What advice would you give to Trump? What could he say or do? Stay off Twitter. Between both of them, have a plan, communicate the plan, prioritize and execute. Make sure everyone knows what’s going on. Do those, you’ll be all right. He’s just going to have to tone it down some. He’s got to — hate to say it — win back some people that he lost. So he’s going to need to tone it down and kind of rebuild those tainted relationships he did last go-round. How do you think he could do that? So I know he tried in some terrible ways, but he’s going to need a P.R. person to really help him reconnect with the populations that he divided and upset. I don’t want to just hear Kanye back at the White House. That’s not going to fix it or solve anything. Just stop being so ridiculous. I mean, he’s not presidential at all. Just get down to business.

,,She’s not quitting. Takeaways from Nikki Haley’s push to stay in the GOP contest against Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley’s team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she’ll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Ahead of a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she’s staying in the race no matter what at least until after another 20 states vote through Super Tuesday on March 5. That’s even as Donald Trump’s MAGA movement is furious that she’s refusing to drop out. After all, she’s the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy ahead of the big speech. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: SHE’S NOT QUITTING Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press that she’s not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that’s even if she’s blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday’s South Carolina primary. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In case you don’t believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. She’s spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. THE LOSSES MAY PILE UP Just don’t ask Haley which primary state she’s going to win. It’s a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren’t willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can’t. That’s because polls suggest she’s a major underdog in virtually every state — even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor — given Trump’s grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party’s most energized partisans — not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” she said. Still, Haley’s team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump — especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM Stop us if you’ve heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he’s betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump’s legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There’s also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren’t ready to surrender to Trump’s MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. LEANING INTO TRUMP LEGAL ISSUES As Trump calls Haley names like “stupid” and “birdbrain,” Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president’s legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much — or more — time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump’s political standing would change dramatically if he’s a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal “piggy bank” for his legal fees. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” And she didn’t exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. “Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he’s going to have to defend himself,” she said in drawing a clear distinction. LONG TERM OUTLOOK HAZY Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party’s July national convention. But Haley said she isn’t yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she’d drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party’s presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that’s likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she’d help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. “I don’t know what actions I’m gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,” Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn’t feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. “I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,” Haley said. “I’m running as a Republican. That’s my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.”  Steve Peoples, The Associated Press   2840 Bremner Ave

,,Nikki Haley hasn’t yet won a GOP contest. But she’s vowing to keep fighting Donald Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — There are no wins on the horizon for Nikki Haley. Those close to the former United Nations ambassador, the last major Republican candidate standing in Donald Trump’s path to the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, are privately bracing for a blowout loss in her home state’s primary election in South Carolina on Saturday. And they cannot name a state where she is likely to beat Trump in the coming weeks. But ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of Saturday’s result. And backed by the strongest fundraising numbers of her political career, she vowed to stay in the fight against Trump at least until after Super Tuesday’s slate of more than a dozen contests on March 5. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In fact, some Republicans are encouraging Haley to stay in the campaign even if she continues to lose — potentially all the way to the Republican National Convention in July. Her continued presence could come in handy in the event that the 77-year-old former president, perhaps the most volatile major party front-runner in U.S. history, becomes a convicted felon or stumbles into another major scandal. As Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement presses for her exit, a defiant Haley will outline her rationale for sticking in the race for the foreseeable future Tuesday afternoon in South Carolina. In an interview ahead of the speech, she highlighted Trump’s legal exposure and criticized MAGA activists who say she’s hurting Trump’s chances against President Joe Biden in the general election by refusing to drop out. “That’s about the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. If I get out of the race today, it will be the longest general election in history,” Haley said. She also pushed back when asked if there is any primary state where she can defeat Trump. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” Haley’s hurdles History would suggest Haley has no chance of stopping Trump. Never before has a Republican lost even the first two primary contests, as Haley has by an average of 21 points, and gone on the win the party’s presidential nomination. Polls suggest she is a major underdog in her home state on Saturday and in the 16 Super Tuesday contests to follow. And since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015, every effort by a Republican to blunt Trump’s rise has failed. Yet she is leaning into the fight. Lest anyone question her commitment, Haley’s campaign is spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan ahead of the state’s Feb. 27 primary, according to spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. At the same time, the AP has obtained Haley’s post-South Carolina travel schedule that features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Indeed, Haley’s expansive base of big- and small-dollar donors is donating at an extraordinary pace despite her underwhelming performance at the polls. That’s a reflection of persistent Republican fears about Trump’s ability to win over independents and moderate voters in the general election and serious concerns about his turbulent leadership should he return to the White House. “I’m going to support her up to the convention,” said Republican donor Eric Levine, who co-hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month. “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” “There’s value in her sticking in and gathering delegates, because if and when he stumbles,” Levine continued, “who knows what happens.” Levine is far from alone. Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, Perez-Cubas said. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever — which includes $2 million in small-dollar donations online in the 48 hours after Trump threatened to “permanently bar” Haley supporters from his MAGA movement. Haley raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. The lone member of Congress who has endorsed Haley, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., insisted that she would stay in the race even if she is blown out in South Carolina, a state where she lives and served two terms as governor. “Obviously, you want to win them all, but for those who say it’s going to embarrass her, or end her political career, I disagree. She’s willing to take that risk,” Norman said in an interview. “I think it’s a courageous thing she’s doing.” Moving forward, Haley’s team is especially focused on several Super Tuesday states with open or semi-open Republican primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate — especially independents and moderates — instead of just hardcore conservatives. Trump not happy Trump, in recent days, has shown flashes of fury in response to Haley’s refusal to cede the nomination. He called her “stupid” and “birdbrain” in a social media post over the weekend and his campaign released a memo ahead of her speech on Tuesday predicting that she would be forced out of the race after losing her home state on Saturday. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” Trump’s campaign chiefs wrote. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Eager to pivot toward a general election matchup against Biden, the Republican former president is taking aggressive steps to assume control of the Republican National Committee, the GOP’s nationwide political machine, which is supposed to stay neutral in presidential primary elections. Last week, Trump announced plans to install his campaign’s senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as RNC’s chief operating officer and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the committee’s co-chair. And there is every expectation that current Chair Ronna McDaniel will step down after Trump wins South Carolina’s primary and party officials will ultimately acquiesce to Trump’s wishes. Privately, Haley’s team concedes there is nothing it can do to stop the Trump takeover. In the interview, Haley warned her party against letting Trump raid the RNC’s coffers to pay for his legal fees while taking a short-term view of Trump’s political prospects. Trump’s standing will fundamentally change if he is a convicted felon before Election Day, Haley said, acknowledging that such an outcome is a very real possibility as Trump navigates 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” As for her path forward, Haley said she’s focused only on her plans through Super Tuesday. As for staying in the race through the July convention, she said she hasn’t thought that far ahead. Some voters wish she would. Gil White, a 75-year-old Republican veteran from James Island, South Carolina, said he was a Trump loyalist until the former president criticized Haley’s husband, a military serviceman, last week. “For him to disparage a military man in deployment is just too much,” White said while attending a Haley rally in Kiawah Island over the weekend. He acknowledged concerns about Haley’s chances against Trump, but said he wants her to stay in the race even if she continues to lose. “I want the choice,” he said. ___ AP writers Meg Kinnard in Columbia, South Carolina, and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed.

,,Biden has lost Arab American voters. So what's the point of 'uncommitted'? | Opinion,"If you believe that an American president has the blood of children who look like yours on his hands, how could you vote for him? Organized by Arab American political activists, the group Listen to Michigan is asking voters who object to President Joe Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war — who view Biden as culpable in the deaths of nearly 30,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry — to choose “uncommitted” on the Feb. 27 Democratic presidential primary ballot. Among Arab American voters I’ve talked to, there’s pain and betrayal, white-hot rage, and a powerful aversion to casting a ballot for Biden, even if that hastens a second Donald Trump presidency, even though no one I talked to believes that would be better for Arab Americans, or for Gaza. And that’s the problem with the vote uncommitted strategy. If it works, it’s a demonstration of electoral power. But what happens next? If you didn’t know voting uncommitted was an option, that’s OK. I’ve covered politics for 20 years and voted in every presidential election since 1996, and I didn’t realize uncommitted was a thing until this month. And yet around 20,000 voters in each party have chosen “uncommitted” in most recent Michigan presidential primaries, in which voters are casting ballots not to elect a candidate, but to apportion delegates. Abbas Alawieh, spokesman for Listen to Michigan, is hoping at least 11,000 additional voters will check the uncommitted box, the margin by which Donald Trump won the state in 2016. Mark Grebner of Practical Political Consulting, the authority on voter data in Michigan, estimates there are roughly 70,000 Arab American voters in Michigan. As of last week, around 400 Arab American voters had requested absentee ballots — a gauge of voter enthusiasm and anticipated turnout — Grebner says. For a presidential primary, it’s normally closer to 1,600. Arab American voters are asking for Republican primary ballots at a higher rate, up by about 7 percentage points.  That’s the other risk, of course — that the strategy won’t pay off at all if the number of voters who choose uncommitted send the message that this is a bloc too small to court. Alawieh says Listen to Michigan is appealing not just to Arab Americans, but the broader antiwar community, with a boost from prominent progressive politicians like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Michigan's own U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in the U.S. Congress. “It feels to those of us organizing for a cease fire and ignored by the president, that maybe he hasn’t heard us yet,” Alawieh told me last week. “Maybe by raising our voices with our votes, he’ll hear us.” Then what? In a normal political horse trade, the terms are clear: Do this for me, and I’ll do that for you. And that would seem to be the point of voting uncommitted — to delineate for Biden the number of votes in an important swing state alienated by his Gaza policy. But the second part? That’s not going to happen. A month after Israel began its bombardment of Gaza, pollster James Zogby of the Arab American Institute found that just 17% of Arab Americans planned to vote for Biden this year, down from 59% in 2020. The president’s approval rating among Arab Americans also cratered, dropping from 74% in 2020 to 29% last November. Some activists have taken to calling Biden “Genocide Joe,"" an epithet it seems nearly impossible to walk back. Even Listen to Michigan can’t promise that a shift on Gaza will result in Arab American votes for Biden this November, and Alawieh seems to resent the calculation. “It's odd to be in the middle of a trauma and talking about votes,” Alawieh said. I point out that Listen to Michigan is framing this conversation around an electoral strategy. “We are making our demands clear: Publicly call for an immediate permanent cease fire and implement some level of accountability, stop military funding or make military funding conditional, and then we can talk about the November election,” he says. “But we’re not living in normal times, we’re living in times when a genocide is being perpetuated, so stop the genocide, and then we can talk about November.” I am worried about uncommitted. It slots neatly into the general malaise about a second Biden term, which started when American voters discovered that he’s old, and that when he opens his mouth, it’s a roll of the dice, something we've all known about Joe Biden for oh, say, the last 40 years. Americans have also decided that the economy — at full employment, with inflation on the decline and real wage growth for the first time in decades — is actually terrible. Now there's Gaza. Back in 2016, there were abundant signs that voters were disenchanted with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But the prevailing wisdom was that they'd just get over it. And a lot of them did (Clinton won the popular vote). But she lost the presidency, in part because she didn't win voters in important swing states. Like Michigan. Arab American voters I've talked to say that if Trump wins, that's not on them, it's on Biden. His policies, not Michigan voters, would have enabled a Trump victory. That's semantics. I believe in voting your conscience. And I respect that Listen to Michigan isn't advising voters to stay home. Voting is our right and responsibility as Americans, and to choose not to vote is to disrespect the sacrifices that bought us this privilege. But presidential elections offer binary choices, and a vote not cast is a vote for the other guy, whose second presidency would be unlikely to benefit Americans of any stripe, Gazans or democracy. There's a lot riding on uncommitted. There's a lot riding on this election. For Biden, and for the rest of us. Nancy Kaffer is the editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press.

,,Political positions of Joe Biden,"   Joe Biden, President of the United States, served as Vice President from 2009 to 2017 and in the United States Senate from 1973 until 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, he made his second presidential run in 2008, later being announced as Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate in 2008. He was elected vice president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. In April 2019, Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign.[1] He became the presumptive Democratic nominee in April 2020,[2] was formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August 2020,[3] and defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.[4] Over his career, Biden has generally been regarded as belonging to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.[5][6] Biden has been described as center[7][8][9] to center-left[10] and has described himself as the latter.[11] Figures farther to the left such as Bernie Sanders have criticized Biden for not embracing Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Biden's policies emphasize the needs of middle-class and working-class Americans[12] and have drawn political support from those groups.[13] Biden has supported campaign finance reform including the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and overturning Citizens United;[14][15] the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act;[16] the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[17][18] student tax credits;[19] carbon emissions cap and trade;[20] the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration;[18] mass transit;[21] renewable energy subsidies;[20] student loan forgiveness;[22] and reversals of Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.[23][12][24] He supports building upon the Affordable Care Act through a public health insurance option instead of a single-payer system.[25][26] He supports decriminalizing cannabis at the federal level and the right for states to legalize it.[27] Biden has been publicly in favor of same-sex marriage since 2012 when he became the highest-ranking U.S. official to voice support for same-sex marriage, preempting Obama on the subject.[28] He also supports the Roe v. Wade decision and since 2019 has been in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.[29][30] In a 2019 article about Biden's record on abortion, his press secretary Jamal Brown said that when Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 he thought Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, but now ""firmly believes that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and should not be overturned"". In 1981, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe v. Wade. In 1982, he voted against the same failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe, and in 2006, he stated in an interview that ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy[.]""[31] He now says he would consider codifying the Roe precedent into federal law in case the United States Supreme Court overturns the ruling.[32][33] He pledged that he would appoint United States Supreme Court justices who shared his beliefs in upholding Roe.[34] From 1976 to June 5, 2019, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment.[35][36] On June 6, 2019, Biden reversed his support and now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment.[37] In 1981, he voted to end federal funding for abortion for victims of rape and incest.[32] Biden previously supported the Mexico City policy, but now supports repealing it.[33] In 2003, Biden voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.[38] In 2007, he opposed the United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart which upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. He defended his opposition, saying he opposed the court's reasoning for the ruling, not the decision itself.[39] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's leading opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[40] In his first Senate campaign, Biden expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[41] In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment.[42] Later, Biden was heckled when he told a meeting of Delaware parents that his position on busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions.[further explanation needed][43] This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with anti-busing senators.[40] In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;[44] he said busing was a ""bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense"" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[45] At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities, and voting rights.[42] In 1977 Biden then voted against integration stating he did not want his children going to school in a ""racial jungle"". Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1978.[46] Biden has supported affirmative action policies.[47] Since June 20, 2019, Biden opposes capital punishment. Biden supports legislation to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and incentivize states to abolish capital punishment. He supports individuals on death row instead serving life sentences without probation or parole.[48][49] Prior to June 20, 2019, he had supported capital punishment. He originally wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act included Title VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, creating 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes,[50] for crimes related to acts of terrorism, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death. However, he voted against limiting appeals in capital cases and also opposed rejecting racial statistics in death penalty appeals.[citation needed] Biden helped author the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which deployed and trained more police officers, increased prison sentences, and built more prisons. The bill led to a decrease in crime rates[citation needed] while also introducing the Violence Against Women Act. Part of the bill was an assault weapon ban and additional money was redirected towards crime prevention programs. Some critics say that the law had the unintended by-effect of creating a financial incentive for jailing people and keeping them there for longer periods of time; this had a disproportionate impact on minorities.[51] In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a slogan of ""defund the police"" arose, which some interpreted to mean the abolition of police departments. Biden stated in a June 2020 opinion piece, ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police."" President Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that Biden supports ""defunding police""; the Trump campaign spent at least $20 million in July 2020 on campaign ads promoting the falsehood.[52][53] As a senator, Biden had long forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure which was supported by police unions but opposed by police chiefs.[54][55] As a 2020 presidential candidate, Biden faced criticism from some on the left for his proposal to double federal spending for community policing programs, to $300 million.[56] He called for racial justice while speaking at George Floyd's funeral service.[57] In September 2020, he condemned the institutional racism in the United States and police violence against African American communities.[58] Biden earned a reputation for being a ""drug warrior"", leading efforts in the war on drugs.[59] During the 1980s crack epidemic when both Democrats and Republicans were ""tough on crime"", Biden was the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee that passed numerous punitive measures against drug offenders. In 1986, Biden sponsored and co-wrote the Anti-Drug Abuse Act which caused a large disparity between the sentencing of crack cocaine and powder cocaine users. Black drug users were more likely than whites to use crack and hence were incarcerated in larger numbers.[60][61] He later acknowledged the negative consequences of the legislation and in 2010 supported the Fair Sentencing Act.[62] The bill eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine, and aimed to reduce the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses.[63] Biden favored increased funding for anti-drug efforts. He frequently criticized President Ronald Reagan in this regard,[64] stating in 1982 that the administration's ""commitment is minuscule in terms of dollars"".[65] He also criticized President George H. W. Bush's anti-drug strategy as ""not tough enough, bold enough or imaginative enough"",[66] stating that ""what we need is another D-Day, not another Vietnam, not a limited war, fought on the cheap"".[64] In 1982, Biden advocated for the creation of a drug czar, a government official overseeing all anti-drug operations. This led to the establishment of the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.[59] Biden also supported increased penalties against those caught selling drugs within 1,000 feet of schools.[67] Biden advocated for increased use of civil asset forfeiture by law enforcement agencies.[66] Biden played a key part in the passage of the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act in 1983, partnering with Strom Thurmond, a conservative Republican. A Washington Post article described Biden's role in the negotiations: ""He got the Democrats to agree to strengthen forfeiture laws and allow judges to hold more defendants without bail; he persuaded the Republicans to drop such controversial provisions as a federal death penalty, and he made sure Thurmond got most of the credit. Civil liberties groups said the measure could have been far worse without Biden.""[68] In the early 2000s, Biden was critical of raves, describing most of them as ""havens"" for use of ecstasy and other illegal drugs.[69] He was the sponsor of the bipartisan Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act in 2002; the bill's successor, the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, was later enacted as part of a broader 2003 crime bill that became law.[69][70] The legislation, an expansion of the existing 1986 federal anti-""crack house"" statute, provided for civil and criminal penalties for event promoters and property owners/managers who knowingly allowed their property to be used for sale or consumption of drugs.[71] The legislation was opposed by the ACLU and electronic dance music enthusiasts who viewed it as overly broad.[70][72] Responding to criticism, Biden said that the statute would not target law-abiding promoters, saying on the Senate floor: ""The reason I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill 'the rave scene' or silence electronic music—all things of which I have been accused. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or expression. It is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids.""[70] Although the law has been rarely used, advocates such as Drug Policy Alliance and DanceSafe argue that it discourages event producers from engaging in harm reduction efforts, and have sought to clarify the law.[73] Biden opposed the legalization of marijuana as a young senator in 1974, in contrast to his other more liberal views.[74] In 2010 he maintained this position, stating: ""I still believe it's a gateway drug. I've spent a lot of my life as chairman of the Judiciary Committee dealing with this. I think it would be a mistake to legalize.""[66] In a 2014 interview, Biden said, ""I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources"" but said, ""Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization.""[75] In 2019 and 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden expressed support for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing medical marijuana; reclassifying it as a Schedule II drug to ease marijuana research; automatically expunging prior convictions for marijuana convictions; and allowing states to legalize without federal interference.[76][77] In October 2022, President Biden announced that all federal convictions for simple marijuana possession would be pardoned, while also announcing that he would initiate a review to determine how cannabis should be scheduled under federal law, adding that the Schedule I classification of cannabis ""makes no sense"".[78][79] As Vice President, Biden actively engaged with Central American leaders on issues of drug cartels, drug trafficking, and migration to the U.S. caused by insecurity and drug violence. (See Central America below.) Biden was a major author of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990[80] and voted in favor of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994.[81] He voted in favor of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, but in 2007 called for the legislation to be scrapped or overhauled.[82] He supports class size reductions and investment in early childhood education.[82] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has proposed tripling Title I funds (which go to low-income schools) to pay for increases in student supports and teacher salaries; doubling the number of school guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, and nurses; providing for universal prekindergarten, and fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act within a decade.[80] Biden also supports federal infrastructure legislation providing funding for school buildings; allowing high school students to use Pell Grants for dual enrollment; and expanding career and technical education through school/community college/employer partnerships.[80] Biden opposes federal funding for for-profit charter schools (which make up a small percentage of charter schools)[83][84] and opposes ""private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer–funded resources away from the public school system.""[84] He supports allowing parents and students to choose between traditional public schools, magnet schools and ""high-performing"" charter schools.[84] Biden's plans have been praised by the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers,[83] the major U.S. teachers' unions, which both endorsed Biden in 2020.[85][86] In April 2020, Biden proposed forgiving student debt from public colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, for people earning up to $125,000 per year.[22] Throughout his career, Biden has supported gun control measures.[87] Although he voted for the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act, a bill supported by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) that passed the Senate 79–15, Biden also authored the 1993 federal assault weapons ban, and is a longtime supporter of universal background checks, and received ""F"" ratings from the NRA while he was in Congress.[88] The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[89][90] Biden supported the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established five-day waiting periods for handgun purchases and background checks.[91] He had a central role in the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which banned the manufacture, transfer, or possession of certain firearms classified as assault weapons (with a grandfather clause excepting guns owned prior to its implementation).[92] After the ban expired in 2004, Biden voted in favor of renewing it in a 2007 Senate vote.[87] The Obama/Biden administration also unsuccessfully pressed for renewal of the ban.[92] Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) of 2005, which immunizes firearm manufacturers from lawsuits based on gun violence.[87] After the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, Obama named Biden to lead a task force on gun violence and community safety.[93][94][95] Biden and the administration proposed universal background checks (with an exception for gun transfers between family members),[96] resumption of public health research on gun violence, and reinstatement of the federal assault weapons ban.[93][94][95] Proposals requiring legislative action were killed in the Republican-controlled Congress[93][94][95] amid opposition from the NRA.[96] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden's proposals on gun violence include universal background checks for gun sales, repeal of PLCAA, reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines, and incentives for states to adopt red flag laws.[94] Biden owns two shotguns.[97][98] After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist attack, Biden drafted anti-terrorist legislation, which was ultimately defeated. He later claimed publicly on several occasions that the USA PATRIOT Act, which eased restrictions on the Executive branch in the surveillance and detention of those suspected of terrorism or facilitating it, was essentially a duplicate of the anti-terrorist legislation he had drafted years earlier.[99] Biden supported the PATRIOT Act but voted to limit wiretapping on the bill. He supports implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to fight terrorists but voted to preserve habeas corpus rights to the alleged terror suspects serving in Guantanamo Bay. In the 1990s, he voted in favor of 36 vetoed military projects and supports efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. He was given a 60% approval rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reflecting a mixed voting record on civil rights issues. During a debate on November 15, 2007, Biden clarified the PATRIOT Act's effect, his continued support for it, and his opposition to racial profiling.[100] On the War on Terror, Biden voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.[101][102] While in the Senate, Biden voted in favor of the 1986 immigration bill (which passed) and the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill (which failed).[103] In a 2007 Democratic presidential primary debate, Biden said that it would be impractical and expensive to deport every unauthorized immigrant in the U.S. and proposed an earned path to citizenship, saying: ""Get a background check on all of them, take out the criminals, get them back, and provide for a means by which we allow earned citizenship over the next decade or so. Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical.""[104] Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized and partially funded the construction of fencing along the Mexican border,[105] mostly as a means to combat cross-border drug trafficking.[104] During the same campaign, Biden said that would not allow sanctuary cities to ignore federal law.[106] In 2007, Biden said that illegal immigration would not stop unless U.S. employers stopped hiring undocumented workers, saying: ""All the rest is window dressing.""[107] As vice president, Biden supported the 2013 bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, a bill crafted by the Gang of Eight (four Democratic, four Republican senators) that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants with security checks, devoted unprecedented resources to border security, created a new work visa program, and established a mandatory employment verification system to ensure that persons hired are authorized to work in the U.S. As president of the Senate, Biden personally presided over the Senate when the bill passed 68–32.[108][109] The legislation failed, however, in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.[110] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden issued his ""Biden Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants,"" in which he pledged to ""secure our border, while ensuring the dignity of migrants and upholding their legal right to seek asylum. ... enforce our laws without targeting communities, violating due process, or tearing apart families,"" ""ensure our values are squarely at the center of our immigration and enforcement policies,"" and create a ""fair and humane immigration system.""[111] Biden's proposals would undo Trump's immigration policies,[112][113] which Biden has criticized as immoral, inhumane, ineffective, economically damaging, and unconstitutional.[111] Biden said he would raise the annual ceiling for refugees from 15,000 (the historically low level set under the Trump administration) to 125,000 (higher than the Obama-era ceiling).[114] He pledged a reversal of the Trump administration's family separation policy, travel/refugee bans, and severe restrictions on asylum,[111][113] calling these policies ""cruel and senseless"" and ""un-American.""[111] If elected, he pledges to reverse Trump's public charge rule and ""so-called National Emergency,"" which diverted money from the Defense Department to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[111] Biden criticized Trump's promotion of a border wall, noting that smuggling through legal ports of entry, rather than simple illicit border-crossing, is the dominant method by which illicit drugs enter the U.S., and that ""sophisticated criminal organizations"" can easily circumvent physical barriers through ""border tunnels, semi-submersible vessels, and aerial technology.""[111] Biden has called for better security along the border and at ports of entry through technology and infrastructure (such as ""cameras, sensors, large-scale x-ray machines, and fixed towers"") as well as through improved coordination between federal agencies, as well as Mexican and Canadian authorities.[111] During his 2020 campaign, Biden proposed a ""surge"" of humanitarian resources to the border and restoration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented youth raised in the United States (the ""Dreamers"").[111] As a longer-term goal, Biden said he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.[112][113] Biden also pledged to create a program to allow U.S. military veterans deported by the Trump Administration to return to the United States.[111] He supports evidence-based alternatives to prolonged immigration detention,[111] and a ban on for-profit detention centers.[112] Biden does not support abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as some on the left-wing have called for, but said that his administration would ensure that ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers ""abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.""[112] Biden does not support the decriminalization of unauthorized border-crossing,[112] but pledged to restore ""sensible enforcement priorities"" that focus deportation and other enforcement efforts on persons convicted of serious crimes.[113][111] rather than people ""who have lived, worked, and contributed to our economy and our communities for decades.""[111] To address a backlog in the immigration courts, Biden proposed a doubling of the number of immigration judges and interpreters.[112] Biden also opposes Trump's attempts to withhold federal grant funding from sanctuary cities.[106] Regarding migrant crises, Biden's 2020 immigration policy emphasized a need to address the root causes of migration from the Central America's Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, such as endemic instability, corruption, gang violence and gender-based violence, and a lack of the rule of law. Biden pledged to update the Central American Minors Program and advance humanitarian aid, stability, and economic development in the region. He also stated that he would use the Temporary Protected Status program for persons whose countries of origin suffer from violence or unsafe conditions.[111][113] In 2006, in its Technology Issues Voter's Guide, CNET.com gave Biden a score of 37.5% on his Senate voting record.[115][116] Biden was a co-sponsor of the Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act of 2007.[117] Biden also sponsored two bills, the Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act (SB 266) and the Violent Crime Control Act (SB 618), both of which contained language seen as effectively banning encryption.[118] Crypto notes Biden wrote that language into the text of SB 266.[119] Phil Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, has said it was SB 266 that ""led [him] to publish PGP electronically for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.""[120] He later stated in a Slashdot article that he was not specifically criticizing Biden, that he would consider the Senator's ""whole body of work"" when considering whether to vote for him on the Democratic ticket in 2008 and that ""considering the disastrous erosion in our privacy and civil liberties under the (Bush) administration, I feel positively nostalgic about Biden's quaint little non-binding resolution of 1991"".[121] While in the Senate, Biden voted in 1993 for a broad defense bill that included the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law on LGBT service in the U.S. military, after voting to remove the amendment.[28][122][123] As vice president, Biden supported the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which repealed the prohibition on open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in the U.S. military.[122] In 1996, Biden voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act which prohibited the federal government from recognizing any same-sex marriage, barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law, and allowing states to do the same.[124] In the Senate, Biden was an outspoken critic of congressional Republicans' efforts in the 2000s to adopt a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage; in arguing against the proposal in 2004, Biden cited his position that same-sex marriage was an issue for states to decide.[28] During the lead up to the 2008 US presidential election he said ""In an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple"" and that they both opposed ""redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage"".[125] In a May 2012 Meet the Press interview, Vice President Biden reversed his previous position and publicly supported same-sex marriage, saying he was ""absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that.""[126] Prior to Biden's statement on Meet the Press, the Obama administration endorsed civil unions, but not same-sex marriage.[127] Biden's decision reportedly forced Obama's hand, pressuring Obama to accelerate his own public shift to support same-sex marriage.[128][129] In 2013, Section 3 of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional and partially struck down in United States v. Windsor. The Obama Administration did not defend the law and congratulated Windsor.[130] Biden supported the U.S. Supreme Court's 5–4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which held that same-sex couples have a federal constitutional right to marry. Biden issued a statement saying that the ruling reflected a principle that ""all people should be treated with respect and dignity – and that all marriages, at their root, are defined by unconditional love.""[131] In an event with the group Freedom to Marry, Biden described the decision as ""the civil rights movement of our generation"" and as consequential as Brown v. Board of Education.[132] Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential run, as did other LGBT leaders.[133] Biden supports the Equality Act, proposed federal legislation that would extend the nondiscrimination protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover discrimination ""on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.""[134] The legislation would protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination across the country in housing, public accommodations, public education, credit, and the jury system, in addition to current federal employment protections.[135] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden vowed to support legislation and action to prohibit discrimination against transgender people and to combat hate crimes targeting LGBT persons, including violence and harassment against transgender people.[136][137][138] However, his administration proposed a regulation to allow schools to bar transgender athletes from competitive teams, a decision which was strongly opposed by transgender advocates.[139][140][141][142] He has criticized Republicans, and particularly Vice President Mike Pence, for using ""religious freedom as an excuse to license discrimination.""[137][138] He supports the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a proposed anti-bullying law.[137] Biden has mentioned Catholic social teaching as an influence on his personal political beliefs.[143] At a November 2011 campaign event, in response to a question about how Biden viewed Mitt Romney's Mormon faith in November 2011, Biden said, ""I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision. It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way.""[144] Biden cited the anti-Catholic prejudice encountered by John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.[145] In 1991, Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when it held confirmation hearings on Republican President George H. W. Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. During the nomination process, Thomas was accused of a consistent pattern of sexual harassment, to which Anita Hill testified before the committee.[146] During the hearing, Biden referred to an inconclusive FBI report on the accusations by Hill as ""he said, she said.""[147] Biden refused to call other women who were willing to testify against Thomas as corroborating witnesses.[148] He voted against Thomas's confirmation both in the committee and on the Senate floor.[149] In 2017, Biden apologized to Hill over her treatment in the hearings, stating: ""Let's get something straight here, I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas... I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through. Think of the courage that it took for her to come forward.""[150] Speaking in 2018, Biden expressed regret about not being more firm in preventing Senate colleagues on the committee from engaging in what he called ""character assassination"" of Hill, saying: ""Anita Hill was vilified when she came forward, by a lot of my colleagues, I wish I could have done more to prevent those questions and the way they asked them....Under the Senate rules, I can't gavel you down and say you can't ask that question, although I tried. And so what happened was she got victimized again during the process.""[151] In 1994, Biden drafted the Violence Against Women Act; some suggest this was drafted in light of criticism Biden had received following the treatment of Anita Hill.[152] This law provided $1.6 billion to enhance investigation and prosecution of the violent crime perpetrated against women, increased pre-trial detention of the accused, provided for automatic and mandatory restitution of those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave unprosecuted. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the VAWA on Constitutional grounds in United States v. Morrison. Biden has said, ""I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate. Indeed, the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault. Our nation has been rewarded for this commitment. Since the Act's passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50%.""[153] He has also said that the Act ""empower[s] women to make changes in their lives, and by training police and prosecutors to arrest and convict abusive husbands instead of telling them to take a walk around the block"".[154] In 2017, Biden told a group of students that having sex with a woman while she is drunk is rape.[155] Biden supported the 2008 farm bill, calling it a ""responsible compromise.""[156] When he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden identified agricultural development and global food prices as major issues.[156] While in the Senate, Biden called for strong action against invasive species, citing the economic and environmental risks associated with them, including displacement of native shipping, the introduction of disease, and interference with shipping.[156] In the Senate, Biden paid particular attention to issues affecting the poultry industry, which is economically important to Delaware, especially in the Delmarva peninsula.[156] In the 1990s, Biden criticized the Russian government for threatening to ban imported U.S. chicken,[156] and in 2008 criticized the Russian government for banning imports of chicken from 19 poultry processing plants in the United States, Biden stated that ""Russia is once again using non-tariff barriers as an excuse to close its markets to American poultry. ... Russia has repeatedly shown that it is not ready to abide by the rules of international trade.""[157] Biden described the Russian action as ""part of a bigger picture in which Russia has failed to behave as a responsible member in the international community"" and called for the U.S. to block Russia's application to join the World Trade Organization.[157] Biden also worked to promote funding to research avian influenza.[156] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has outlined a rural and agricultural policy broadly similar to that of the Obama administration. The plan aims to obtain net zero emissions for agriculture (making the U.S. the first nation to do so) via incentives and permitting farmers to join carbon markets. The plan also calls for changes in trade policy to encourage U.S. agriculture exports; expansion of broadband Internet in rural areas; renewable energy investment; promotion of local and regional food; and an expansion of the USDA Conservation Stewardship Program to encourage farmers to adopt carbon sequestration and other environmental practices.[158] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies and Biden's largest contributor in the late 1990s,[51] and other credit card issuers.[159] He fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines.[159] He also worked to defeat amendments which would have protected members of the military and those who are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debt. Critics expressed concern that the law would force those seeking bankruptcy protection to hire lawyers to process the required paperwork, making it more difficult for students to execute education-related debt.[51] The overall bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton in 2000, but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting it.[159] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden moved to the left on the issue, endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy reform proposal, which would roll back many aspects of the 2005 law.[160][161][162] During and after the Obama/Biden administration, Biden strongly supported the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented new financial regulations designed to prevent a reprise of the 2008 financial crisis. The Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[163][164][165] He also supported the pro-consumer Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act.[165] Biden has been credited with introducing the first climate change bill in Congress.[166] Biden's initial bill, the Global Climate Protection Act, was introduced in 1986; it died in the Senate, but a version was included in a bill signed into law by President Reagan as an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act in December 1987.[166] In 2008, Biden was the lead sponsor of a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution calling on the U.S. to be a part of the United Nations climate change negotiations, and was a co-sponsor of the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, at the time the most stringent climate bill in the Senate. The legislation would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions and required a reduction in U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.[167] He strongly opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling,[168][169] although when he became president, he only called for a temporary moratorium instead.[170] In 2007–2008, during his presidential campaign, Biden called for a gradual increase in automobile fuel-economy standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2017,[167] called for increase production of renewable energy,[167] and identified energy security and resolving the energy crisis as key priorities.[171] In June 2019, Biden's presidential campaign unveiled a $1.7 trillion climate policy plan aiming to eliminate U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The proposal incorporated elements of the Green New Deal proposal but lacked many key aspects, such as less funding, no healthcare expansion, no guaranteed jobs or benefits, less guaranteed housing, and no bans on fracking.[172] Biden's plan would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; halt issuance of new permits for oil and gas extraction on public land and water; step up Clean Air Act enforcement; strengthen fuel economy standards to promote a shift to electric vehicles; regulate methane pollution; and create ""aggressive"" energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.[173] Biden also promised that he would re-enter the Paris Agreement (from which Trump pulled the U.S.) on his first day in the White House and called for ""a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries' climate targets.""[173] To pressure countries failing to meet their climate obligations, Biden also called for ""carbon adjustment fees"" to be levied on goods imported from countries that failed to meet emissions targets.[173] The plan also won considerable support from the fossil fuel industry.[174] Biden's Green New Deal plan is incorporated in his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, which would in part lead to the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps.[175] In November 2021, Biden promised to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030,[176] in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.[177][178] A week after the November closing of COP26 the Biden administration held the largest federal gas and oil lease auction in U.S. history, selling 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The areas can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. In January 2021, the administration put a pause on new federal gas and oil leasing but was sued to open them for sale by several Republican-led states. When a federal judge sided with the states Biden appealed the decision but agreed to continue with the sales. The administration has also proposed another round of gas and oil lease sales in 2022, in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states.[179][180] In 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which represents the largest investment into addressing climate change in United States history.[181] During the Obama administration, Biden was the lead figure promoting the administration's proposal to spend $53 billion over six years toward construction of a national intercity high-speed rail network, in furtherance of Obama's goal (outlined in the 2011 State of the Union Address) to extend high-speed rail access to 80% of the American population over a quarter-century.[182][183][184] Republicans in Congress rejected the proposal, which did not advance.[185][186] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden released a $1.3 trillion infrastructure improvement plan, which would follow up on Obama administration priorities.[187] The plan calls for $50 billion investment in repairs to existing roads and bridges in his first year in office; $10 billion over a decade to transit construction in high-poverty parts of the U.S.; doubling funding for BUILD and INFRA grants, and more funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.[187] The plan also includes proposals for investments in high-speed rail, public transit, and bicycling,[186] as well as school construction, replacement of water pipes and other water infrastructure, and expansion of rural broadband.[188] The plan also specifically calls for the rebuilding of the Hudson River Tunnel and the expansion of the Northeast Corridor, as well as rail investments in California and the Midwest and West.[186] Biden proposed funding the plan through tax increases on high-income Americans and corporations; the campaign stated that ""reversing the excesses of the Trump tax cuts for corporations; reducing incentives for tax havens, evasion, and outsourcing; ensuring corporations pay their fair share; closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward wealth, not work; and ending subsidies for fossil fuels"" would provide the revenue for the plan, making it deficit-neutral.[188] A long-term rider and advocate of Amtrak, during his 2020 campaign, Biden said that, if elected, his administration would ""spark the second great railroad revolution"" and move to electrify Amtrak trains.[189] He also voiced support for 2,000 Amtrak workers furloughed due to Trump administration budget cuts, although he did not take a specific position on Amtrak personnel and service reductions.[189] In the Senate, Biden consistently supported ""a U.S.-led, rules-based international order with an emphasis on reducing trade barriers and setting global trade standards.""[190] He had a mixed record on specific free trade agreements;[191][192] he voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, and Morocco–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, but voted against free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Oman, and the Dominican Republic and Central America (CAFTA), viewing their labor and environmental protections as insufficient.[191][192] He voted in favor of fast track trade promotion authority in 1998 and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000.[191][192] During the Obama administration, Biden was a strong advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership,[193] arguing that the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP ""put China in the driver's seat"" by allowing it to ""write the rules of the road for the world"" in the absence of U.S. participation.[192] Biden has been critical of Chinese trade tactics, including ""dumping"" of steel and Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property.[192] He believes the US, rather than China, should write the rules that govern trade, in which ""workers, the environment, transparency, and middle-class wages"" are protected.[194] He has criticized the Trump trade war with China for failing to ""resolve the issues at the heart of the dispute"";[192] for the trade war's negative effect on U.S. agriculture and manufacturing;[192][195] and for Trump's unilateral approach.[190] Biden also criticized Trump for labeling Canada and the European Union as ""national security threats,""[192] arguing that this undercuts multilateral efforts with allies to combat Chinese trade abuses.[192][190] He supports pressuring China on environmental issues and supports the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.[192] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Obama administration's signature health care reform legislation.[196][197] He has condemned the Trump administration's attempts to strike down the ACA in court,[196] including in California v. Texas.[198] Biden supports the ACA's protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions as well as the ACA's minimum standards for health insurance plans; he has pledged to preserve these protections.[199] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has promoted a plan to expand and build upon the ACA, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[196] Biden's plan is to create a public option for health insurance, with the aim of expanding health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans.[196] He does not support single-payer health care proposals such as Medicare for All.[200] Under Biden's proposal, ""no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums.""[201] Under Biden's plan, all those on the individual insurance market would qualify for tax credits on premiums (a change from existing law, which caps premium tax credits at four times the federal poverty level, or under $50,000 for an independent). To reduce prescription drug prices, Biden proposes allowing import of prescription drugs and authorizing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices.[196] In April 2020, Biden proposed lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60.[22][199] Biden supports an end to surprise billing.[199] Biden was given an 85% lifetime approval rating from AFL–CIO.[203] and was a cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act.[204] As stated during his 2020 presidential campaign, the Biden administration intended to fight laws ""that exist only to deprive unions of the financial support they need to fight for higher wages and better benefits""[205] and sought to end or curtail the enforcement of the so-called 2020 Trump Rule which was the Department of Labor's (DOL) heightened oversight of union financial disclosure requirements.[206] The so-called ""Trump Rule"" still exists, the Biden administration announced on March 29 that it will not be enforcing the heightened union reporting requirements to the DOL concerning strike funds, apprenticeship programs, and other union-related “trust fund” information.[207] While he describes himself as pro-labor, Biden has also supported legislation that would impose unpopular contracts on workers, forcing them to work without sick leave and using the Railway Labor Act to prevent workers from striking.[208][209] Worker unions have voted against the proposal, citing quality of life concerns.[210] In particular, it would penalize employees for medical visits, a policy that has been blamed for worker deaths and was a major issue during the COVID-19 pandemic.[211][212] Railroad companies have seen sizeable profits under this policy and have been unwilling to negotiate, praising Biden for his proposed government intervention, which would compel workers to accept their terms.[210][213][214] Biden opposed the George W. Bush administration's tax cuts enacted mostly in 2001 and 2003, noting that most of the benefits of the tax cuts went to the very wealthiest U.S. families, and arguing that the cuts did not help working-class and middle-class Americans.[215] The Obama/Biden administration advocated keeping the cuts in place for 98% of U.S. taxpayers but letting them expire on income over $250,000 earned by couples (or income over $200,000 for individuals).[215] After the Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 election, Biden was designated as the administration's chief negotiator with congressional Republicans—specifically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—regarding the Bush tax cuts, which were about to expire.[216] The administration opposed extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy but also did not want to trigger tax increases for non-wealthy Americans when the economy was continuing to recover from the Great Recession.[216] The result was a deal: ""Biden and McConnell hashed out a deal that extended all the Bush tax cuts until after the 2012 election, while injecting another $300 billion as an economic stimulus, including a new payroll tax cut for workers, extended unemployment benefits for victims of the recession and expanded tax credits for college students and the poor. By reopening the Senate, the deal also enabled the historic vote to repeal the ban on gay people in the military.""[216] Biden opposes privatizing or means-testing of Social Security.[217] He was given an 89% approval rating from the Alliance for Retired Americans (ARA), reflecting a pro-senior citizen voting record.[218] Biden has called for an expansion of Social Security, including by increasing payments to the oldest Americans (persons who have been receiving retirement benefits for at least 20 years); setting a minimum guaranteed benefit (equal to at least 125% of the federal poverty level) for all Americans with at least 30 years of work; and increasing monthly survivor benefits for widows and widowers by about 20%.[217] Biden has proposed to fund the expansion, and to make the Social Security Trust Fund solvent over the long-term, through tax increases on the highest income-earners.[217] Biden has condemned Trump for waging ""a reckless war on Social Security"" by signing an executive order in 2020 that deferred the collection of the payroll tax that funds Social Security, and for Trump's comments suggesting that he might seek to forgo the tax.[219] Biden said that Trump's move will ""undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.""[219] Biden voted for the 1996 bipartisan welfare reform compromise legislation.[220] Biden pledged a large federal government response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic akin to the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt following the Great Depression.[221] This would include increased COVID-19 testing, ensuring a steady supply of personal protective equipment, distributing a vaccine once available, and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national ""supply chain commander"" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits, distributed by a ""Pandemic Testing Board"" (similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board).[221] Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a ""public health jobs corps"" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks.[221] Biden has said that ""The United States will always reserve the right to defend itself and its allies, by force, if necessary. But force must be used judiciously to protect a vital interest of the United States, only when the objective is clear and achievable, with the informed consent of the American people, and where required, the approval of Congress.""[222] He has emphasized ""returning the United States to its traditional role as the leader of a world order based on promotion of democracy, multilateralism, alliance-building and diplomatic engagement""[223] and pledged in 2020 that if elected, he would reinvigorate the U.S.'s traditional alliances, including with countries alienated by Trump, and would convene a summit of major heads of state.[224] Biden opposes military action aimed at regime change, but has said that ""it is appropriate for us to provide nonmilitary support for opposition movements seeking universal human rights and more representative and accountable governance.""[222] With respect to humanitarian intervention, Biden has said the U.S. has ""a moral duty, as well as a security interest, to respond to genocide or chemical weapons use"" but that such cases ""require action by the community of nations, not just the United States.""[222] Biden has said that he plans to restore U.S. membership in key United Nations bodies, such as UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),[224] the World Health Organization,[225] and possibly the Human Rights Council.[224] Biden opposed U.S. government funding of abstinence-only sex education programs in Africa, and in 2007, cosponsored the HIV Prevention Act which would end President George W. Bush's mandate that one-third of all funds be earmarked to abstinence-only programs.[226] Biden favors greater U.S. engagement with Africa to counter growing Chinese influence on the continent.[224] In 2011, during the Obama administration's internal debate on the Libyan Civil War, Biden opposed the U.S. intervention.[227][228] Biden stated he was ""strongly against going to Libya"" due to the instability it would cause after Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, recounting to Charlie Rose later: ""My question was, 'OK, tell me what happens.' He's gone. What happens? Doesn't the country disintegrate? What happens then? Doesn't it become a place where it becomes a petri dish for the growth of extremism? And it has.""[229] Biden publicly defended the Obama administration's ultimate decision to participate in the Libya intervention, saying in 2011, ""NATO got it right. In this case, America spent $2 billion and didn't lose a single life. This is more the prescription for how to deal with the world as we go forward than it has in the past.""[230] Biden favored an American deployment of troops to Darfur during the war in Darfur, saying that 2,500 U.S. troops could stop the violence in the region.[226] As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has been a prominent voice calling for ""hard-headed diplomacy"" with Iran. He also has called for the implementation of ""coordinated international sanctions"" on Iran, adding ""we should complement this pressure by presenting a detailed, positive vision for U.S.–Iran relations if Iran does the right thing.""[226] In 2007, Biden voted against a measure to declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. He wrote in December 2007 that ""War with Iran is not just a bad option. It would be a disaster."" Biden threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Bush if he had started a war with Iran without Congressional approval.[226] In an interview in September 2008, Biden stated that the IRGC was a terrorist organization and that the Bush administration already had the power to designate it as one. He stated that he voted against the measure out of concern that the Bush administration would misuse the measure to justify a military attack against Iran.[231] As vice president, Biden vigorously defended the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration between Iran and the U.S. and other global powers.[232] Biden has criticized Trump's withdrawal from the agreement and the Trump administration's Iran strategy as ""a self-inflicted disaster,"" saying in 2019 that Iran had ""only gotten more aggressive"" since Trump ""unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated.""[233] Biden said, ""I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They've ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them, and a self-defeating way. Trump's approach is demonstrably the latter. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy – clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship.""[234] If elected president, Biden said he would reenter and strengthen the nuclear agreement once Iran is in compliance.[235] In 1990, after Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Biden voted against the first Gulf War, asking: ""What vital interests of the United States justify sending Americans to their deaths in the sands of Saudi Arabia?""[236] In 1998, Biden expressed support for the use of force against Iraq and urged a sustained effort to ""dethrone"" Hussein over the long haul.[237] In 2002, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he stated that Hussein was ""a long-term threat and a short term threat to our national security"" and that ""We have no choice but to eliminate the threat. This is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world. He must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power.""[238] Biden also supported a failed resolution authorizing military action in Iraq only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts.[239] Biden subsequently voted in favor of the 2002 resolution that authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying, ""I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations. Because while Iraq's illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not – do not – pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.""[240] During the Iraq War, Biden consistently criticized the George W. Bush administration for ""its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq.""[240] He criticized Bush in March and April 2003 for failing to make robust diplomatic efforts to avert war but said at the time that it was ""the right decision"" to ""separate him (Hussein) from his weapons and/or separate him from power.""[240] In an interview of Meet the Press in November 2005, Biden said of his 2002 vote to authorize the use of force: ""It was a mistake. It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. ... We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.""[240] In 2007, Biden strongly opposed Bush's ""troop surge"" in Iraq, calling it a ""tragic mistake.""[241] He promoted legislation to repeal and replace the 2002 resolution that authorized the war, arguing that it was no longer necessary because Hussein had been removed for power and executed, and because no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in Iraq.[241] The replacement resolution favored by Biden would provide that U.S. troops could combat terrorism and train Iraqi forces, but begin a ""responsible drawdown"" of U.S. troops that would end in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.[241] In May 2006, in an op-ed in The New York Times, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, proposed a plan for a decentralized, federal Iraq, with a relatively weak central government with strong Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish regional administrations that would govern largely autonomously within their own regions.[241][242][243][244] Under the plan, there would not have been a partition of the country,[243] but the central government would have its responsibilities limited to areas of common concern, such as ""border defense, foreign policy, and oil production and revenue sharing.""[242] The goal of the plan was to halt the high level of sectarian violence in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.[241][242][243] Biden likened the plan to the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which led to an end to the Bosnian War.[242][244] The plan received a mixed reception.[242] A non-binding ""sense of the Senate"" resolution in support of the plan, sponsored by Biden and Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas), passed the Senate in a September 2007 on a 75–23 vote.[242][243] However, the proposal was opposed by Bush administration and many Iraqi political parties, including the United Iraqi Alliance of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.[242] The autonomy/federalism proposal was broadly unpopular among Iraqi Arabs, both Sunni and Shia,[245][242][246] but was welcomed by Iraqi Kurds and the Kurdistan Regional Government,[245] as well as by Iraq President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd and proponent of Iraqi federalism.[242] In a 2016 interview with Council on Foreign Relations president Richard N. Haass, Biden spoke about changing ""the fundamental approach [America] had to the Middle East"", and that the lesson learned from Iraq is ""the use of force with large standing armies in place was extremely costly, [and] would work until the moment we left.""[247] In the Senate, Biden developed lifelong relationships with Israeli officials through his work on the Foreign Relations Committee,[248] beginning with Golda Meir in 1973.[249][248][250] Biden called his meeting with Meir as a young senator on the eve of the Yom Kippur War ""one of the most consequential meetings I've ever had in my life.""[251] He has regularly described himself as a Zionist,[226][249] and is a longtime supporter of Israel, which Biden considers to be a key U.S. strategic ally in the Middle East.[249][252] On the Senate floor in 1986 he defended US funding of Israel referring to it as ""the best $3 billion investment we make"" and declared that ""were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region"".[253][254] When Biden was selected by Obama as a running mate, National Jewish Democratic Council chairman Ira Forman praised the choice, saying, ""There is no one you could possibly pick who knows the issues, who is committed to Israel's security and knows Israeli leaders, as much as Joe Biden.""[255] During the 2008 presidential campaign, Biden stressed in a Florida campaign event that he and his running mate Obama were both strongly pro-Israel and would make Israel more secure.[250][256][257] Biden also said: ""A strong America is a strong Israel. I have a 35-year record of supporting Israel, and Israel's security is enhanced the stronger America is.""[258] In the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated ""no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden. I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion.""[259] In 2008, Biden criticized the George W. Bush administration and John McCain, arguing: ""By any empirical standard, Israel is less secure today than it was when George Bush became president. He has made one foul-up after another that John has supported.""[250][256] Biden called for a proactive US role in the Israel-Palestinian peace process,[252] which he argued would be advanced if the U.S. took steps to ""regain the respect of the world.""[258] He called for increased engagement with Syria over the Golan Heights dispute, the disarmament of Hezbollah, and Syrian influence in Lebanon.[252] In 2008, discussing the possibility of Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Biden said it was ""not a question for us to tell the Israelis what they can and cannot do"" but that he had ""faith in the democracy of Israel"" and supported additional diplomatic efforts to avert military conflict.[231] In April 2009, Biden again said that Israel would not launch a unilateral strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, stating: ""I think [Israel] would be ill-advised to do that. And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago.""[260] Throughout his career, Biden has had a strong relationship with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), speaking at the group's events and fundraisers;[251] Biden and AIPAC have mutually praised each other.[261] Nevertheless, Biden has not always agreed with the group's stances, saying in 2008 that ""AIPAC does not speak for the entire American Jewish community. There's other organizations as strong and as consequential"" and adding ""I've never disagreed with AIPAC on the objective. Whenever I've had disagreement with AIPAC it has always been a tactical disagreement, not a substantive disagreement.""[262] Biden strongly opposed granting executive clemency to Jonathan Pollard, who was convicted of spying for Israel, saying ""If it were up to me, he would stay in jail for life.""[248][263] Biden praised the United Arab Emirates's offer to recognize Israel in a August 2020 normalization agreement, calling the agreement ""a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship.""[264][265] In an effort to reduce the rise of Anti Semitism in the United States, the Biden administration launched[266] the first ever national strategy to combat Anti Semitism on May 25, 2023. Biden has consistently supported a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying it is (1) ""the only path to long-term security for Israel, while sustaining its identity as a Jewish and democratic state""; (2) ""the only way to ensure Palestinian dignity and their legitimate interest in national self-determination""; and (3) ""a necessary condition to take full advantage of the opening that exists for greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.""[251] He cosponsored the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 which expressed U.S. support for a two-state solution.[226][267] In a 2007 interview, when asked about the failure to achieve Israeli-Palestinians peace, Biden stated that ""Israel's a democracy and they make mistakes. But the notion that somehow if Israel just did the right thing, [the peace process] would work ... give me a break."" He also stated that ""The responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist, will not play fair, will not deal, will not renounce terror.""[255] During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated that the Bush administration's policy concerning the Middle East had been ""an abject failure"" and pledged that, if elected, he and Barack Obama would ""change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.""[259] In a 2010 speech to the Jewish Federations of North America, Biden said ""There is no substitute for direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured – the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli people's decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for nationhood.""[268] Speaking in 2019, Biden said, ""At the present, neither the Israeli nor Palestinian leadership seems willing to take the political risks necessary to make progress through direct negotiations,"" and said that if elected president, he would be focusing on urging ""both sides to take steps to keep the prospect of a two-state outcome alive.""[251] Following Trump's controversial move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Biden said he would not return the embassy to Tel Aviv if elected president, but that he would re-open the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem for outreach to Palestinians.[251] Biden reaffirmed his support for a two-state solution during his presidency, noting it in an April 2021 telephone call with King Abdullah II of Jordan.[269] Biden has consistently criticized Israeli settlement policy.[251] In a 2009 speech at the AIPAC conference, Biden called upon Israel ""to work towards a two-state solution"" by dismantling existing Israeli settlements, halting new settlement construction, and allowing Palestinians freedom of movement, and called on the Palestinians to ""combat terror and incitement against Israel.""[270] In a 2016 speech to J Street, Biden said that he had ""overwhelming frustration"" with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the government's promotion and expansion of settlements, legalization of outposts, and land seizures. Noting that he had opposed Israeli settlements for more than three decades, Biden said they are counterproductive to Israel's security. In the same speech, Biden criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks and Palestinian recourse to the International Criminal Court, which he called ""damaging moves that only take us further from the path toward peace,"" and called out President Mahmoud Abbas for failing to condemn terrorist attacks. Regarding a multi-billion dollar defense deal that the U.S. was negotiating with Israel, Biden said ""Israel will not get everything it asks for, but it will get every single solitary thing it needs,"" and said: ""No matter what political disagreements we have with Israel – and we do have political disagreements now – there is never any question about our commitment to Israel's security.""[271][272] In a subsequent speech in December 2019, Biden criticized Netanyahu for his drift to ""the extreme right in his party,"" calling this move a bid to retain political power and a ""serious mistake.""[273] Biden criticized Israel's plan to annex parts of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.[274] In June 2020, Biden's foreign policy advisor Tony Blinken said that Biden ""would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree."" Biden said that if elected president he will firmly reject the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign ""which singles out Israel and too often veers into antisemitism – and fight other efforts to delegitimize Israel on the global stage.""[275] Biden has called Saudi Arabia a pariah state.[276][277] Biden criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen,[195] accusing Saudi Arabia of killing ""innocent people"" in that war.[276] He said that if elected president, he would end US involvement in that war and re-assess Saudi Arabia-United States relations. He criticized the Trump administration's sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.[195] Saudi Arabia reportedly took more than 24 hours to congratulate Joe Biden on his November 3, 2020, Presidential election victory. Biden demanded more accountability over Jamal Khashoggi's murder from Saudi Arabia during his campaigns. The elections saw the defeat of Donald Trump who had close personal ties with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.[278] In a 2018 conversation for Foreign Affairs, Biden described Syria as ""a classic example of the biggest conundrum that we have to deal with."" He sees America's current situation in Syria as having ""lost the notion among our European friends that we know what we're doing, that we have a plan."" He emphasized the necessity of stabilizing Syria, especially in major cities like Raqqa.[279] Raqqa is in ruins after lengthy battles between ISIL and Kurdish forces, the SDF, with assistance from the U.S.-led coalition.[280] Biden said a multi-billion dollar investment is required to rebuild the city. He believes Iran, not Russia, will be the biggest beneficiaries in the short term if Syria remains a battlefield. President Bashar al-Assad will also need to be removed from power, otherwise Syria will never have peace or security.[279] Biden said there is no uniting principle in Syria, unlike Iraq, hence only certain safe harbors can be established in the region to reduce the number of displaced people and deaths.[279] In 2014, Biden said that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had ""poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al-Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.""[281] Shortly afterward, Biden later apologized to the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over comments that Turkey supported jihadist rebels in Syria.[282] However, Biden has remained strongly critical of Erdoğan; in December 2019, Biden referred to Erdoğan as an ""autocrat"" and criticized his treatment of the Kurds in Turkey, Turkish military links with Russia (including Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense equipment), and the Turkish government's threats to limit access to U.S. airfields in Turkey.[283][284] Biden has long been a supporter of the rights of the Kurds.[245][285] In 2020, Biden told Kurdistan 24, ""Masoud Barzani is a good friend of mine, and I wished we could have done more for the Kurds."" When asked why he could not, Biden said: ""Turkey.""[245] Biden has criticized the Kurdish separatist organization PKK; in 2016, he said the PKK was a terrorist group ""plain and simple"" and compared it to ISIL.[286] Also in 2016, Biden warned Kurds against seeking a separate state on the Turkish-Syrian border.[287] In 2016, Biden condemned the coup attempt in Turkey,[287] but also criticized the Turkish government's subsequent campaign of repression against journalists, political dissidents, and academics, and violations of freedom of speech.[288][289] Biden also rebuffed attempts by Erdoğan and the Turkish government to pressure the U.S. to extradite dissident cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey, noting that under U.S. law, the matter was for the legal system and federal courts to decide, and the Obama administration had no proper role. (The Turkish government has clashed with Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt; Gulen denies the allegation).[290][291][292] In September 2020, Biden demanded that Turkey ""stay out"" of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in which Turkey has supported the Azeris.[293][294] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, ""Whatever it takes, we should do it.""[295] In 2008, Pakistan awarded the Hilal-e-Pakistan (Crescent of Pakistan) to Joe Biden and Senator Richard Lugar ""in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan"".[296] This was after Biden passed a bill authorizing $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.[297] In a 2008 interview, Biden criticized Bush for presenting Iraq as the primary front against terrorism, saying the U.S. should ""urgently shift our focus"" from Iraq to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, which Biden described as ""the real central front on the so-called war on terrorism,"" noting that ""The Afghanistan-Pakistan border is where the 9/11 attacks were plotted... It's where most attacks on Europe since 9/11 have originated. It's where Osama bin Laden lives and his top confederates still enjoy safe haven, planning new attacks.[298] Biden said that ""the outcome of that battle is going to be determined less by bullets than by dollars and determination"" and that the U.S.'s ""original sin was starting a war of choice [the intervention in Iraq] before we finished a war of necessity [the war in Afghanistan].""[298] During the Obama administration's internal debates, Biden argued strongly against the 2009 surge of troops to Afghanistan, putting him on the opposite side of Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[228][299] Biden argued that rampant corruption and ineffectiveness in the Afghan government, military, and police made the U.S. strategy unworkable, and was ""agnostic"" about the survival of the Kabul-based government.[299] In 2012, speaking to West Point graduates, Biden argued that the Obama administration's drawdown of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq allowed the U.S. ""enabled us to replace and rebalance our foreign policy"" to focus on other challenges.[300] In 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden pledges to bring home the remaining U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan during his first term in office, and that ""any residual U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be focused only on counterterrorism operations.""[301] With respect to Asia, Biden favors restoring the ""traditional U.S. stance supporting the presence of American troops in Japan and South Korea.""[224] In 2016, Biden described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as an agreement that was as much about geopolitics as economics. Being part of the Obama administration, he supported the agreement in an attempt to ""rebalance towards Asia"" against a stronger and bolder Chinese foreign policy in the region.[247] Biden first visited China in April 1979, where met with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on the first U.S. congressional delegation to China since the 1949 revolution.[302] In 2000, he voted in favor of normalizing trade relations with China and supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[302] Over the years, Biden has frequently criticized the Chinese government for its human rights abuses, while also acknowledging the need to gain Chinese cooperation on issues such as climate change, Iran and North Korea.[302] Biden was outraged by the Chinese government's violent repression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and in the Senate introduced legislation to create the democracy-promoting Radio Free Asia, which opened in 1996 and continues to operate.[302] In June 2019, Biden wrote, ""China's continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can't be ignored.""[195] Biden termed the Chinese actions against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province a genocide.[302] Also in 2020, Biden expressed support for Hong Kong's protests.[303] In 2018, Biden said he had spent more time in private meetings with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping than any other world leader.[279] He has criticized Xi as ""a guy who doesn't have a democratic – with a small d – bone in his body. This is a guy who is a thug.""[304][305] Biden pledged, if elected, to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[302] In 2019, Biden said that China is ""not competition"" for the United States, drawing criticism from prominent members of both parties.[306] In 2021, Biden called China America's ""most serious competitor"".[307] On February 10, Biden spoke to Xi for the first time after taking office as U.S. president and told a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, ""If we don't get moving, they are going to eat our lunch.""[308] Biden was accused of giving a ""shameful"" answer when asked about Uyghur genocide in a CNN town hall in 2021, claiming it was a result of ""different cultural norms"".[309] Speaking in 2006, Biden described North Korea as a ""paper tiger"" that lacked the capacity to directly cause harm to America, but condemned North Korean nuclear testing as a ""deliberate and dangerous provocation.""[226] He proposed a requirement, included in the 2007 national defense authorization act, for the Bush administration to appoint a special coordinator on North Korea, and described Korean Peninsula tensions as one of ""the three most important things that the next president is going to have to deal with"" (along with policy on Iraq and Iran).[226] As vice president, Biden visited South Korean President Park Geun-hye and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In a 2013 speech in Seoul, Biden said: ""The United States and the world have to make it absolutely clear to Kim Jong-un that the international community will not accept or tolerate nuclear arms in North Korea. The simple fact is this—North Korea can never achieve security and prosperity so long as it pursues nuclear weapons, period. We are prepared to go back to the six-party talks when North Korea demonstrates its full commitment to a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.""[310] Biden has criticized Trump's warm personal relations with Kim as ""antithetical to who we are,"" saying, ""Are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Kim Jong-un?""[311] Biden also criticized Trump for engaging in ""three made-for-TV summits"" that have led to no ""concrete commitment from North Korea.""[312] Biden has pledged, if elected president, to discontinue Trump's direct personal diplomacy with Kim[313] and engage in a ""sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others"" to pressure North Korea toward denuclearization.""[312] North Korean state media attacked Biden in 2019 as ""an imbecile""; a spokesman for Biden's campaign responded: ""Trump has also been repeatedly tricked into making major concessions to the murderous regime in Pyongyang while getting nothing in return. Given Vice President Biden's record of standing up for American values and interests, it's no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House.""[311] In May 2021, President Biden expressed his and South Korea's commitment to ""the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula...[and addressing North Korea's] nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""[314] In the 1990s, Biden was involved in efforts to stop the Bosnian genocide by Bosnian Serb forces.[315] He supported the ""lift and strike"" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.[316][317] Biden supported sending in the American airforce to blow up ""all of the bridges on the Drina"" and to take out their oil supplies.[318] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.[319] During the Kosovo War (1999), Biden supported US military intervention against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).[316] He was strongly critical of Serbia, saying that Serbs are ""illiterates, degenerates, baby killers and rapists"".[320] He co-sponsored a resolution with John McCain for use of force by the US to halt Yugoslav military actions toward Kosovo Albanians.[315][319][321] Biden has pressed Serbia over the issue of missing persons and war crimes.[315] He supports the independence of Kosovo and considers it ""irreversible"".[322] In 2010 he referred to the Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Thaci as ""the George Washington of Kosovo"".[323] According to Biden, he was one of ""only three people in Washington"" who thought that the US troops ""should go straight to Belgrade and arrest Milosevic"" even at the cost of American lives:[324] ""We should announce there's going to be American casualties. We should go to Belgrade, and we should have a Japanese-German style occupation of that country."" In his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden supports an agreement of mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia, and for Kosovo to attain EU visa liberalisation.[315] He also supports Albania's territorial security and its reform agenda aimed toward becoming a future EU member.[315] Biden supports Bosnian territorial integrity and sovereignty, its multi-ethnic society and future membership in NATO and the EU.[315] During his campaign for the presidency, Biden has called for restoring friendly U.S. relationship with fellow NATO member states, which have been strained by insults and antagonism from Trump,[224] as well as by criticism by Trump of NATO and other multilateral alliances.[325] Biden criticized Trump's decision to withdraw 9,500 U.S. troops stationed in Germany.[326] Biden has criticized Trump for treating NATO as ""a protection racket"" rather than ""the most significant military alliance in the history of the world"" and Biden advisors have identified a strengthened NATO as a key component of countering a rising China.[326] According to European diplomats and trade experts, a Biden presidency would likely lead to a boost in the U.S.-British ""special relationship""; repair alliances broken during the Trump administration; and enhance the likelihood of a trans-Atlantic trade agreement.[325] Biden is a staunch supporter of the European Union (EU).[327] Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election caused consternation among some in the unionist community due to comments made in the past indicating apparent sympathies to Irish republicanism.[328] DUP representatives in particular criticized a joking comments made by Vice-President Biden on St Patrick's Day 2015 to the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny; ""anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here"".[328][329][330] The color orange in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is associated with the Orange Order and Protestantism more generally.[329][330] Regarding Brexit, Biden in 2020 warned the British government not to jeopardize peace in Northern Ireland by negating the rules and regulations of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and has said that ""Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.[331][332] Speaking in 2020, former U.S. Ambassador to the EU Anthony L. Gardner said that ""Joe Biden believes that the triangle of relationships, US–UK, UK–EU, US and EU, all have to work together, and you will see statements to that effect.""[332] Biden condemned ""LGBT-free zones"" in Poland, saying they ""have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world.""[333] In 1999, Biden cosponsored a draft resolution condemning Russia's military campaign to crush the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the use of indiscriminate force by the Russian army against civilians and violations of the Geneva Convention, and urged a peaceful resolution of the conflict.[334][335] In 2005, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution criticizing Russia for failing to uphold its commitments at the 1999 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Summit, which included agreements on a completed Russian military withdrawal from Moldova's breakaway, pro-Russian region of Transnistria. That resolution also expressed disapproval of Russia's demand for the closure of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), which served to observe border crossings between Georgia and the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia. That bill passed in the Senate.[226] Biden introduced legislation in July 2008 urging members of the Group of Eight to ""work toward a more constructive relationship with Russia"", and encouraging Russia to behave according to the G-8's ""objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, and democracy."" The resolution also called on Russian and U.S. leaders to increase cooperation and funding for the Nunn-Lugar program and other nonproliferation initiatives. It also emphasized the need for a successor to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty. The resolution passed.[226] Biden has voiced concerns about Russia backsliding on democratic reforms. In August 2008, Biden criticized Russia's military action in Georgia in support of South Ossetian separatists. ""By acting disproportionately with a full-scale attack on Georgia and seeking the ouster of Georgia's democratically elected President Mikheil Saakashvili, Moscow is jeopardizing its standing in Europe and the broader international community – and risking very real practical and political consequences"", Biden wrote in a Financial Times op-ed. Biden urged Russia to abide by the negotiated cease-fire.[226] Through 2020, Biden and Putin had met once, in Moscow in March 2011. After an official group meeting Biden characterized in his memoir as ""argumentative,"" he and Putin met privately, with Biden saying ""Mr. Prime Minister, I'm looking into your eyes,"" (a reference to a 2001 meeting between Putin and President Bush, who later said ""I looked the man in the eye...I was able to get a sense of his soul""). Biden continued, ""I don't think you have a soul."" Putin replied, ""We understand each other.""[336] In a 2018 Foreign Affairs op-ed co-written with Michael Carpenter, Biden described Russia as a kleptocratic, nationalist-populist state that considers Western democracy its existential threat. He acknowledged that the Kremlin launched coordinated attacks across many domains – military, political, economic, informational – against various Western democratic countries, including cyberattacks on the 2016 United States presidential election and 2017 French presidential election. As a result of Russia's threat, Biden supports a ""strong response"" with cooperation from America's allies and campaign finance reform that will prohibit foreign donations from flowing into domestic elections.[337] Blockquote|text=Western democracies must also address glaring vulnerabilities in their electoral systems, financial sectors, cyber-infrastructure, and media ecosystems. The U.S. campaign finance system, for example, needs to be reformed to deny foreign actors – from Russia and elsewhere – the ability to interfere in American elections. Authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the secretive bundling of donations that allows foreign money to flow to U.S. organizations (such as “ghost corporations”) that in turn contribute to super PACs and other putatively independent political organizations, such as trade associations and so-called 501(c)(4) groups. Congress must get serious about campaign finance reform now; doing so should be a matter of bipartisan consensus since this vulnerability affects Democrats and Republicans in equal measure.|sign=Joe Biden, Michael Carpenter|source=""How to Stand Up to the Kremlin"" He also condemned Trump for equivocating ""on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election, even after he received briefings from top intelligence officials on precisely how Moscow did it.""[338] At the 2019 Munich Security Conference, Biden reiterated his opposition to Russian interference in elections and their actions against European neighbors, saying, ""We have to be explicit in our response and make clear to Russia that there's a price to pay for these transgressions of international norms"", and that the U.S. needs to continue to support its NATO allies, as well as Georgia and Ukraine who are not part of NATO, by ""establishing virtually continuous air, land and sea presence on NATO's eastern perimeter."" He also expressed concerns about Russian influence operations targeting American politics.[339] On 19 January 2022, President Biden said that he believed Russia would invade Ukraine.[340] Biden said a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be ""the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace"" since World War Two.[341] In January 2022, the Biden administration approved deliveries of U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.[342] President Biden was considering deploying up to 50,000 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe.[343] White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said that ""President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February [2022]""[344] Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disagreed on how imminent the threat was.[345][346] After Russia invaded Ukraine he imposed sanctions on Russia and authorized foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.[347][348] As part of the Obama Administration, Biden supported the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to combat drug cartels and strengthen law enforcement in Central America. Between 2008 and 2011, the Department of State provided $361.5 million to Central American countries. The State Department stated five main goals to CARSI: When Biden met with Central American leaders in Honduras in 2012, he reiterated the Obama Administration's pledge of $107 million in aid for the region. The Administration would work with Congress to provide the funds under CARSI. These initiatives were part of a larger effort for institutional reform in the region to counter drug trafficking.[350][351] During the 2014 Central American child-migrant crisis, Biden supported a $1 billion economic aid package to affected Central American countries. In an op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote, ""the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.""[352] He also supported further institutional reforms to combat corruption in those countries, so they can provide their people with safer living conditions.[353] While in the Senate, Biden voted for the Helms-Burton Act and supported the U.S. embargo against Cuba; in 2006, Biden called for the U.S. to be ""putting together a plan as to how we are going to play a positive role in moving that country, after the Castros are gone ... more toward democratization and liberalization.""[226][354] As vice president, Biden supported Obama's Cuban thaw and reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.[355] Biden stated that the lifting of U.S. trade and travel restrictions removed an ""ineffective stumbling block to our bilateral relations with other nations in the hemisphere"" and made it easier for the U.S. to engage on issues around human rights.[355] Biden has criticized Trump's moves to roll back the détente between the U.S. and Cuba, writing in an op-ed in Americas Quarterly that Trump's resumptions of restrictions on travel and commerce harm Cubans seeking ""greater independence from the Communist state"" and alienate Western Hemisphere allies.[356] Biden also wrote in the Miami Herald that ""Trump's...callously limiting the ability of Cuban Americans to reunite with and support their families in Cuba, and the administration's Latin America policy, at best, is a Cold War-era retread and, at worst, at worst, an ineffective mess.""[357] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to restore Obama-era U.S. relations with Cuba.[224][358] Asked about the 2021 Cuban protests, Biden criticized the ""failed state"" of Cuba for repressing its citizens and referred to communism, which Cuba follows, as ""a universally failed system."" The President also described socialism as ""not a very good substitute.""[359][360][361]  ",en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Joe_Biden,,
,,Fake 'Biden' robocall tells New Hampshire Democrats to stay home," As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robocall is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home - using a fake audio of US President Joe Biden. ""It's important that you save your vote for the November election….voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says. The White House confirmed Monday that the call was not recorded by Biden and said the incident highlights the challenges emerging technologies present, especially ahead of the November presidential election. ""The president has been clear that there are risks associated with deep fakes. Fake images and misinformation can be exacerbated by emerging technologies,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in Washington. The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is investigating what he called an apparent ""unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters."" The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden's name on their ballots. Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was ""disinformation"" and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden's write-in campaign will be closely watched amid weak polls for the president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party's nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden's name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire's historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden ""voice"" is heard using one of his signature phrases, ""What a bunch of malarkey."" The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party chair. Sullivan called the robocall an attempt at election interference and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated. In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday night. ""Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire primary,"" she said. She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number without her permission. The explosion of generative AI - which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts - in recent months has spurred both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and even possibly overpower humans. The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was ""absolutely not"" involved in the robocall. The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not involved. The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a reporter on Sunday night. ""Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing,"" the Phillips campaign said. Take Israel home with the new

,,She’s not quitting. Takeaways from Nikki Haley’s push to stay in the GOP contest against Trump,"KIAWAH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Nikki Haley’s team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she’ll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Ahead of a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she’s staying in the race no matter what at least until after another 20 states vote through Super Tuesday on March 5. That’s even as Donald Trump’s MAGA movement is furious that she’s refusing to drop out. After all, she’s the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy ahead of the big speech. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: SHE’S NOT QUITTING Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press that she’s not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that’s even if she’s blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday’s South Carolina primary. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In case you don’t believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. She’s spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. THE LOSSES MAY PILE UP Just don’t ask Haley which primary state she’s going to win. It’s a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren’t willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can’t. That’s because polls suggest she’s a major underdog in virtually every state — even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor — given Trump’s grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party’s most energized partisans — not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” she said. Still, Haley’s team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump — especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM Stop us if you’ve heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he’s betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump’s legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There’s also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren’t ready to surrender to Trump’s MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. LEANING INTO TRUMP LEGAL ISSUES As Trump calls Haley names like “stupid” and “birdbrain,” Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president’s legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much — or more — time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump’s political standing would change dramatically if he’s a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal “piggy bank” for his legal fees. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” And she didn’t exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. “Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he’s going to have to defend himself,” she said in drawing a clear distinction. LONG TERM OUTLOOK HAZY Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party’s July national convention. But Haley said she isn’t yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she’d drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party’s presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that’s likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she’d help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. “I don’t know what actions I’m gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,” Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn’t feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. “I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,” Haley said. “I’m running as a Republican. That’s my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.”  Steve Peoples, The Associated Press   2nd Floor 1810 3rd Ave.

,,Democrats have their own worries,"FEB 20, 2024 There’s no way to quantify this, but, suffice it to say, reams and reams of column inches have been gobbled up as reporters chronicle the continuing dramatic soap opera — now in its second year — within the state Republican Party concerning who is the legit party chair. So how ’bout a little equal time for the Democrats, who have their own internal headaches to sort through. Some party dissidents, who consider themselves to be well-meaning, are mounting a full-throttled effort to send the sitting president a message regarding his handling of the Gaza-Israeli war. Their message is: Knock it off and demand a ceasefire to end the brutal human carnage, which is now in its fourth month. One hundred and fifty thousand phone calls in one week on that, and 87,000 to be contacted via email soon. With the Feb. 27 Michigan presidential primary just around the corner, the anti-war group is urging fellow Democrats to vote “uncommitted,” rather than vote for President Joe Biden. “This is not anti-Biden,” one of the national consultants who is working with Michigan Democrats to pull that off explains. It’s aimed at getting him to change course now. But folks like the current Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former Gov. Jim Blanchard are worried that, when the dust settles, that effort will play into the hands of the Donald Trump forces who will use it against Biden by suggesting that “many of Joe Biden’s Democrats are deserting him.” Blanchard figures that “threat on Biden won’t work,” which means it won’t result in a policy shift, but it could cost the president even more votes in November. At the vanguard of the effort in Michigan is former Oakland County progressive Democrat and former Congressman Andy Levin, who believes the effort will work if enough of his compatriots send a strong message by withholding their votes. Part of the coalition to do so includes Arab Americans, Muslim activists, and young Democrats, and Levin believes the president is at risk of losing the state in November if those folks stay home. “They are not going to vote for Trump,” he reassures the White House, but, if they stay home, others figure that is indirectly a vote for Trump, because it’s one less vote for the incumbent. Levin describes that very serious internal revolt in terms of a loving marriage in which you work out your differences in a peaceful give-and-take, with the goal of not only staying together but making the relationship stronger. He thinks that, if 20% or more of the voters vote uncommitted, Biden will eventually “be the peacemaker” and go around the Israeli leader who is hellbent on destroying the enemy and a ceasefire be damned. Levin also believes that, after making their protest known, those Democrats will come home to the president. But what if they don’t? Whitmer reminds the malcontents that that could help Trump regain the White House, and “this would be bad for your communities” of Dearborn and other districts where concern over the war is off the charts. Levin counters he does not want to see the situation evolve into another anti-Vietnam nationwide protest, and, given the number of demonstrations on college campuses and the like, that notion does not appear to be that far-fetched. “The young people are very worried,” he reports. And, just like the Republicans, now the Democrats have something to worry about, too, i.e. a loss to Trump aided and abetted by members of their own party.

,,,"   FEB 19, 2024 Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews with Pennsylvania voters again suggest it's not resonating. Santiago sees the recent 38% rise in use of the organization's food pantry as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,'” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” Today's breaking news and more in your inbox Today's breaking news and more in your inbox  ",www.theintelligencer.net,https://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2024/02/saving-democracy-is-central-to-bidens-campaign-messaging-will-it-resonate-with-swing-state-voters/,"Copyright © The Intelligencer | https://www.theintelligencer.net | 1500 Main Street, Wheeling, WV 26003 | 304-233-0100",

,,The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,"A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing. The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence. Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged cities across the U.S. to celebrate the democratic process that resulted in Trump’s ouster. A second odd thing happened amid Trump’s attempts to reverse the result: corporate America turned on him. Hundreds of major business leaders, many of whom had backed Trump’s candidacy and supported his policies, called on him to concede. To the President, something felt amiss. “It was all very, very strange,” Trump said on Dec. 2. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even while many key states were still being counted.” In a way, Trump was right. There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes, one that both curtailed the protests and coordinated the resistance from CEOs. Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans. The pact was formalized in a terse, little-noticed joint statement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day. Both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain–inspired by the summer’s massive, sometimes destructive racial-justice protests–in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump’s assault on democracy. The handshake between business and labor was just one component of a vast, cross-partisan campaign to protect the election–an extraordinary shadow effort dedicated not to winning the vote but to ensuring it would be free and fair, credible and uncorrupted. For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America’s institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from a remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined President. Though much of this activity took place on the left, it was separate from the Biden campaign and crossed ideological lines, with crucial contributions by nonpartisan and conservative actors. The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory. It was an election so calamitous that no result could be discerned at all, a failure of the central act of democratic self-governance that has been a hallmark of America since its founding. Their work touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program. For Trump and his allies were running their own campaign to spoil the election. The President spent months insisting that mail ballots were a Democratic plot and the election would be “rigged.” His henchmen at the state level sought to block their use, while his lawyers brought dozens of spurious suits to make it more difficult to vote–an intensification of the GOP’s legacy of suppressive tactics. Before the election, Trump plotted to block a legitimate vote count. And he spent the months following Nov. 3 trying to steal the election he’d lost–with lawsuits and conspiracy theories, pressure on state and local officials, and finally summoning his army of supporters to the Jan. 6 rally that ended in deadly violence at the Capitol. The democracy campaigners watched with alarm. “Every week, we felt like we were in a struggle to try to pull off this election without the country going through a real dangerous moment of unraveling,” says former GOP Representative Zach Wamp, a Trump supporter who helped coordinate a bipartisan election-protection council. “We can look back and say this thing went pretty well, but it was not at all clear in September and October that that was going to be the case.” This is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election, based on access to the group’s inner workings, never-before-seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved from across the political spectrum. It is the story of an unprecedented, creative and determined campaign whose success also reveals how close the nation came to disaster. “Every attempt to interfere with the proper outcome of the election was defeated,” says Ian Bassin, co-founder of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan rule-of-law advocacy group. “But it’s massively important for the country to understand that it didn’t happen accidentally. The system didn’t work magically. Democracy is not self-executing.” That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures. Sometime in the fall of 2019, Mike Podhorzer became convinced the election was headed for disaster–and determined to protect it. This was not his usual purview. For nearly a quarter-century, Podhorzer, senior adviser to the president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest union federation, has marshaled the latest tactics and data to help its favored candidates win elections. Unassuming and professorial, he isn’t the sort of hair-gelled “political strategist” who shows up on cable news. Among Democratic insiders, he’s known as the wizard behind some of the biggest advances in political technology in recent decades. A group of liberal strategists he brought together in the early 2000s led to the creation of the Analyst Institute, a secretive firm that applies scientific methods to political campaigns. He was also involved in the founding of Catalist, the flagship progressive data company. The endless chatter in Washington about “political strategy,” Podhorzer believes, has little to do with how change really gets made. “My basic take on politics is that it’s all pretty obvious if you don’t overthink it or swallow the prevailing frameworks whole,” he once wrote. “After that, just relentlessly identify your assumptions and challenge them.” Podhorzer applies that approach to everything: when he coached his now adult son’s Little League team in the D.C. suburbs, he trained the boys not to swing at most pitches–a tactic that infuriated both their and their opponents’ parents, but won the team a series of championships. Trump’s election in 2016–credited in part to his unusual strength among the sort of blue collar white voters who once dominated the AFL-CIO–prompted Podhorzer to question his assumptions about voter behavior. He began circulating weekly number-crunching memos to a small circle of allies and hosting strategy sessions in D.C. But when he began to worry about the election itself, he didn’t want to seem paranoid. It was only after months of research that he introduced his concerns in his newsletter in October 2019. The usual tools of data, analytics and polling would not be sufficient in a situation where the President himself was trying to disrupt the election, he wrote. “Most of our planning takes us through Election Day,” he noted. “But, we are not prepared for the two most likely outcomes”–Trump losing and refusing to concede, and Trump winning the Electoral College (despite losing the popular vote) by corrupting the voting process in key states. “We desperately need to systematically ‘red-team’ this election so that we can anticipate and plan for the worst we know will be coming our way.” It turned out Podhorzer wasn’t the only one thinking in these terms. He began to hear from others eager to join forces. The Fight Back Table, a coalition of “resistance” organizations, had begun scenario-planning around the potential for a contested election, gathering liberal activists at the local and national level into what they called the Democracy Defense Coalition. Voting-rights and civil rights organizations were raising alarms. A group of former elected officials was researching emergency powers they feared Trump might exploit. Protect Democracy was assembling a bipartisan election-crisis task force. “It turned out that once you said it out loud, people agreed,” Podhorzer says, “and it started building momentum.” He spent months pondering scenarios and talking to experts. It wasn’t hard to find liberals who saw Trump as a dangerous dictator, but Podhorzer was careful to steer clear of hysteria. What he wanted to know was not how American democracy was dying but how it might be kept alive. The chief difference between the U.S. and countries that lost their grip on democracy, he concluded, was that America’s decentralized election system couldn’t be rigged in one fell swoop. That presented an opportunity to shore it up. On March 3, Podhorzer drafted a three-page confidential memo titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” “Trump has made it clear that this will not be a fair election, and that he will reject anything but his own re-election as ‘fake’ and rigged,” he wrote. “On Nov. 3, should the media report otherwise, he will use the right-wing information system to establish his narrative and incite his supporters to protest.” The memo laid out four categories of challenges: attacks on voters, attacks on election administration, attacks on Trump’s political opponents and “efforts to reverse the results of the election.” Then COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary-election season. Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff polling places. But political disagreements, intensified by Trump’s crusade against mail voting, prevented some states from making it easier to vote absentee and for jurisdictions to count those votes in a timely manner. Chaos ensued. Ohio shut down in-person voting for its primary, leading to minuscule turnout. A poll-worker shortage in Milwaukee–where Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic Black population is concentrated–left just five open polling places, down from 182. In New York, vote counting took more than a month. Suddenly, the potential for a November meltdown was obvious. In his apartment in the D.C. suburbs, Podhorzer began working from his laptop at his kitchen table, holding back-to-back Zoom meetings for hours a day with his network of contacts across the progressive universe: the labor movement; the institutional left, like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace; resistance groups like Indivisible and MoveOn; progressive data geeks and strategists, representatives of donors and foundations, state-level grassroots organizers, racial-justice activists and others. In April, Podhorzer began hosting a weekly 2½-hour Zoom. It was structured around a series of rapid-fire five-minute presentations on everything from which ads were working to messaging to legal strategy. The invitation-only gatherings soon attracted hundreds, creating a rare shared base of knowledge for the fractious progressive movement. “At the risk of talking trash about the left, there’s not a lot of good information sharing,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a close Podhorzer friend whose poll-tested messaging guidance shaped the group’s approach. “There’s a lot of not-invented-here syndrome, where people won’t consider a good idea if they didn’t come up with it.” The meetings became the galactic center for a constellation of operatives across the left who shared overlapping goals but didn’t usually work in concert. The group had no name, no leaders and no hierarchy, but it kept the disparate actors in sync. “Pod played a critical behind-the-scenes role in keeping different pieces of the movement infrastructure in communication and aligned,” says Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “You have the litigation space, the organizing space, the political people just focused on the W, and their strategies aren’t always aligned. He allowed this ecosystem to work together.” Protecting the election would require an effort of unprecedented scale. As 2020 progressed, it stretched to Congress, Silicon Valley and the nation’s statehouses. It drew energy from the summer’s racial-justice protests, many of whose leaders were a key part of the liberal alliance. And eventually it reached across the aisle, into the world of Trump-skeptical Republicans appalled by his attacks on democracy. The first task was overhauling America’s balky election infrastructure–in the middle of a pandemic. For the thousands of local, mostly nonpartisan officials who administer elections, the most urgent need was money. They needed protective equipment like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. They needed to pay for postcards letting people know they could vote absentee–or, in some states, to mail ballots to every voter. They needed additional staff and scanners to process ballots. In March, activists appealed to Congress to steer COVID relief money to election administration. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 150 organizations signed a letter to every member of Congress seeking $2 billion in election funding. It was somewhat successful: the CARES Act, passed later that month, contained $400 million in grants to state election administrators. But the next tranche of relief funding didn’t add to that number. It wasn’t going to be enough. Private philanthropy stepped into the breach. An assortment of foundations contributed tens of millions in election-administration funding. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative chipped in $300 million. “It was a failure at the federal level that 2,500 local election officials were forced to apply for philanthropic grants to fill their needs,” says Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election official who heads the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute. McReynolds’ two-year-old organization became a clearinghouse for a nation struggling to adapt. The institute gave secretaries of state from both parties technical advice on everything from which vendors to use to how to locate drop boxes. Local officials are the most trusted sources of election information, but few can afford a press secretary, so the institute distributed communications tool kits. In a presentation to Podhorzer’s group, McReynolds detailed the importance of absentee ballots for shortening lines at polling places and preventing an election crisis. The institute’s work helped 37 states and D.C. bolster mail voting. But it wouldn’t be worth much if people didn’t take advantage. Part of the challenge was logistical: each state has different rules for when and how ballots should be requested and returned. The Voter Participation Center, which in a normal year would have supported local groups deploying canvassers door-to-door to get out the vote, instead conducted focus groups in April and May to find out what would get people to vote by mail. In August and September, it sent ballot applications to 15 million people in key states, 4.6 million of whom returned them. In mailings and digital ads, the group urged people not to wait for Election Day. “All the work we have done for 17 years was built for this moment of bringing democracy to people’s doorsteps,” says Tom Lopach, the center’s CEO. The effort had to overcome heightened skepticism in some communities. Many Black voters preferred to exercise their franchise in person or didn’t trust the mail. National civil rights groups worked with local organizations to get the word out that this was the best way to ensure one’s vote was counted. In Philadelphia, for example, advocates distributed “voting safety kits” containing masks, hand sanitizer and informational brochures. “We had to get the message out that this is safe, reliable, and you can trust it,” says Hannah Fried of All Voting Is Local. At the same time, Democratic lawyers battled a historic tide of pre-election litigation. The pandemic intensified the parties’ usual tangling in the courts. But the lawyers noticed something else as well. “The litigation brought by the Trump campaign, of a piece with the broader campaign to sow doubt about mail voting, was making novel claims and using theories no court has ever accepted,” says Wendy Weiser, a voting-rights expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. “They read more like lawsuits designed to send a message rather than achieve a legal outcome.” In the end, nearly half the electorate cast ballots by mail in 2020, practically a revolution in how people vote. About a quarter voted early in person. Only a quarter of voters cast their ballots the traditional way: in person on Election Day. Bad actors spreading false information is nothing new. For decades, campaigns have grappled with everything from anonymous calls claiming the election has been rescheduled to fliers spreading nasty smears about candidates’ families. But Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, the viral force of social media and the involvement of foreign meddlers made disinformation a broader, deeper threat to the 2020 vote. Laura Quinn, a veteran progressive operative who co-founded Catalist, began studying this problem a few years ago. She piloted a nameless, secret project, which she has never before publicly discussed, that tracked disinformation online and tried to figure out how to combat it. One component was tracking dangerous lies that might otherwise spread unnoticed. Researchers then provided information to campaigners or the media to track down the sources and expose them. The most important takeaway from Quinn’s research, however, was that engaging with toxic content only made it worse. “When you get attacked, the instinct is to push back, call it out, say, ‘This isn’t true,'” Quinn says. “But the more engagement something gets, the more the platforms boost it. The algorithm reads that as, ‘Oh, this is popular; people want more of it.'” The solution, she concluded, was to pressure platforms to enforce their rules, both by removing content or accounts that spread disinformation and by more aggressively policing it in the first place. “The platforms have policies against certain types of malign behavior, but they haven’t been enforcing them,” she says. Quinn’s research gave ammunition to advocates pushing social media platforms to take a harder line. In November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election-related falsehoods that were already spreading unchecked. “It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming, all of that to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who attended the dinner and also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. (Gupta has been nominated for Associate Attorney General by President Biden.) “It was a struggle, but we got to the point where they understood the problem. Was it enough? Probably not. Was it later than we wanted? Yes. But it was really important, given the level of official disinformation, that they had those rules in place and were tagging things and taking them down.” Beyond battling bad information, there was a need to explain a rapidly changing election process. It was crucial for voters to understand that despite what Trump was saying, mail-in votes weren’t susceptible to fraud and that it would be normal if some states weren’t finished counting votes on election night. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic former House leader turned high-powered lobbyist, spearheaded one coalition. “We wanted to get a really bipartisan group of former elected officials, Cabinet secretaries, military leaders and so on, aimed mainly at messaging to the public but also speaking to local officials–the secretaries of state, attorneys general, governors who would be in the eye of the storm–to let them know we wanted to help,” says Gephardt, who worked his contacts in the private sector to put $20 million behind the effort. Wamp, the former GOP Congressman, worked through the nonpartisan reform group Issue One to rally Republicans to the effort. “We thought we should bring some bipartisan element of unity around what constitutes a free and fair election,” Wamp says. The 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans on the National Council on Election Integrity met on Zoom at least once a week. They ran ads in six states, made statements, wrote articles and alerted local officials to potential problems. “We had rabid Trump supporters who agreed to serve on the council based on the idea that this is honest,” Wamp says. This is going to be just as important, he told them, to convince the liberals when Trump wins. “Whichever way it cuts, we’re going to stick together.” The Voting Rights Lab and IntoAction created state-specific memes and graphics, spread by email, text, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, urging that every vote be counted. Together, they were viewed more than 1 billion times. Protect Democracy’s election task force issued reports and held media briefings with high-profile experts across the political spectrum, resulting in widespread coverage of potential election issues and fact-checking of Trump’s false claims. The organization’s tracking polls found the message was being heard: the percentage of the public that didn’t expect to know the winner on election night gradually rose until by late October, it was over 70%. A majority also believed that a prolonged count wasn’t a sign of problems. “We knew exactly what Trump was going to do: he was going to try to use the fact that Democrats voted by mail and Republicans voted in person to make it look like he was ahead, claim victory, say the mail-in votes were fraudulent and try to get them thrown out,” says Protect Democracy’s Bassin. Setting public expectations ahead of time helped undercut those lies. The alliance took a common set of themes from the research Shenker-Osorio presented at Podhorzer’s Zooms. Studies have shown that when people don’t think their vote will count or fear casting it will be a hassle, they’re far less likely to participate. Throughout election season, members of Podhorzer’s group minimized incidents of voter intimidation and tamped down rising liberal hysteria about Trump’s expected refusal to concede. They didn’t want to amplify false claims by engaging them, or put people off voting by suggesting a rigged game. “When you say, ‘These claims of fraud are spurious,’ what people hear is ‘fraud,'” Shenker-Osorio says. “What we saw in our pre-election research was that anything that reaffirmed Trump’s power or cast him as an authoritarian diminished people’s desire to vote.” Podhorzer, meanwhile, was warning everyone he knew that polls were underestimating Trump’s support. The data he shared with media organizations who would be calling the election was “tremendously useful” to understand what was happening as the votes rolled in, according to a member of a major network’s political unit who spoke with Podhorzer before Election Day. Most analysts had recognized there would be a “blue shift” in key battlegrounds– the surge of votes breaking toward Democrats, driven by tallies of mail-in ballots– but they hadn’t comprehended how much better Trump was likely to do on Election Day. “Being able to document how big the absentee wave would be and the variance by state was essential,” the analyst says. The racial-justice uprising sparked by George Floyd’s killing in May was not primarily a political movement. The organizers who helped lead it wanted to harness its momentum for the election without allowing it to be co-opted by politicians. Many of those organizers were part of Podhorzer’s network, from the activists in battleground states who partnered with the Democracy Defense Coalition to organizations with leading roles in the Movement for Black Lives. The best way to ensure people’s voices were heard, they decided, was to protect their ability to vote. “We started thinking about a program that would complement the traditional election-protection area but also didn’t rely on calling the police,” says Nelini Stamp, the Working Families Party’s national organizing director. They created a force of “election defenders” who, unlike traditional poll watchers, were trained in de-escalation techniques. During early voting and on Election Day, they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a “joy to the polls” effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open in their communities. The summer uprising had shown that people power could have a massive impact. Activists began preparing to reprise the demonstrations if Trump tried to steal the election. “Americans plan widespread protests if Trump interferes with election,” Reuters reported in October, one of many such stories. More than 150 liberal groups, from the Women’s March to the Sierra Club to Color of Change, from Democrats.com to the Democratic Socialists of America, joined the “Protect the Results” coalition. The group’s now defunct website had a map listing 400 planned postelection demonstrations, to be activated via text message as soon as Nov. 4. To stop the coup they feared, the left was ready to flood the streets. About a week before Election Day, Podhorzer received an unexpected message: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber have a long history of antagonism. Though neither organization is explicitly partisan, the influential business lobby has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Republican campaigns, just as the nation’s unions funnel hundreds of millions to Democrats. On one side is labor, on the other management, locked in an eternal struggle for power and resources. But behind the scenes, the business community was engaged in its own anxious discussions about how the election and its aftermath might unfold. The summer’s racial-justice protests had sent a signal to business owners too: the potential for economy-disrupting civil disorder. “With tensions running high, there was a lot of concern about unrest around the election, or a breakdown in our normal way we handle contentious elections,” says Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer. These worries had led the Chamber to release a pre-election statement with the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based CEOs’ group, as well as associations of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, calling for patience and confidence as votes were counted. But Bradley wanted to send a broader, more bipartisan message. He reached out to Podhorzer, through an intermediary both men declined to name. Agreeing that their unlikely alliance would be powerful, they began to discuss a joint statement pledging their organizations’ shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election. They chose their words carefully and scheduled the statement’s release for maximum impact. As it was being finalized, Christian leaders signaled their interest in joining, further broadening its reach. The statement was released on Election Day, under the names of Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, and the heads of the National Association of Evangelicals and the National African American Clergy Network. “It is imperative that election officials be given the space and time to count every vote in accordance with applicable laws,” it stated. “We call on the media, the candidates and the American people to exercise patience with the process and trust in our system, even if it requires more time than usual.” The groups added, “Although we may not always agree on desired outcomes up and down the ballot, we are united in our call for the American democratic process to proceed without violence, intimidation or any other tactic that makes us weaker as a nation.” Election night began with many Democrats despairing. Trump was running ahead of pre-election polling, winning Florida, Ohio and Texas easily and keeping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania too close to call. But Podhorzer was unperturbed when I spoke to him that night: the returns were exactly in line with his modeling. He had been warning for weeks that Trump voters’ turnout was surging. As the numbers dribbled out, he could tell that as long as all the votes were counted, Trump would lose. The liberal alliance gathered for an 11 p.m. Zoom call. Hundreds joined; many were freaking out. “It was really important for me and the team in that moment to help ground people in what we had already known was true,” says Angela Peoples, director for the Democracy Defense Coalition. Podhorzer presented data to show the group that victory was in hand. While he was talking, Fox News surprised everyone by calling Arizona for Biden. The public-awareness campaign had worked: TV anchors were bending over backward to counsel caution and frame the vote count accurately. The question then became what to do next. The conversation that followed was a difficult one, led by the activists charged with the protest strategy. “We wanted to be mindful of when was the right time to call for moving masses of people into the street,” Peoples says. As much as they were eager to mount a show of strength, mobilizing immediately could backfire and put people at risk. Protests that devolved into violent clashes would give Trump a pretext to send in federal agents or troops as he had over the summer. And rather than elevate Trump’s complaints by continuing to fight him, the alliance wanted to send the message that the people had spoken. So the word went out: stand down. Protect the Results announced that it would “not be activating the entire national mobilization network today, but remains ready to activate if necessary.” On Twitter, outraged progressives wondered what was going on. Why wasn’t anyone trying to stop Trump’s coup? Where were all the protests? Podhorzer credits the activists for their restraint. “They had spent so much time getting ready to hit the streets on Wednesday. But they did it,” he says. “Wednesday through Friday, there was not a single Antifa vs. Proud Boys incident like everyone was expecting. And when that didn’t materialize, I don’t think the Trump campaign had a backup plan.” Activists reoriented the Protect the Results protests toward a weekend of celebration. “Counter their disinfo with our confidence & get ready to celebrate,” read the messaging guidance Shenker-Osorio presented to the liberal alliance on Friday, Nov. 6. “Declare and fortify our win. Vibe: confident, forward-looking, unified–NOT passive, anxious.” The voters, not the candidates, would be the protagonists of the story. The planned day of celebration happened to coincide with the election being called on Nov. 7. Activists dancing in the streets of Philadelphia blasted Beyoncé over an attempted Trump campaign press conference; the Trumpers’ next confab was scheduled for Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside the city center, which activists believe was not a coincidence. “The people of Philadelphia owned the streets of Philadelphia,” crows the Working Families Party’s Mitchell. “We made them look ridiculous by contrasting our joyous celebration of democracy with their clown show.” The votes had been counted. Trump had lost. But the battle wasn’t over. In Podhorzer’s presentations, winning the vote was only the first step to winning the election. After that came winning the count, winning the certification, winning the Electoral College and winning the transition–steps that are normally formalities but that he knew Trump would see as opportunities for disruption. Nowhere would that be more evident than in Michigan, where Trump’s pressure on local Republicans came perilously close to working–and where liberal and conservative pro-democracy forces joined to counter it. It was around 10 p.m. on election night in Detroit when a flurry of texts lit up the phone of Art Reyes III. A busload of Republican election observers had arrived at the TCF Center, where votes were being tallied. They were crowding the vote-counting tables, refusing to wear masks, heckling the mostly Black workers. Reyes, a Flint native who leads We the People Michigan, was expecting this. For months, conservative groups had been sowing suspicion about urban vote fraud. “The language was, ‘They’re going to steal the election; there will be fraud in Detroit,’ long before any vote was cast,” Reyes says. He made his way to the arena and sent word to his network. Within 45 minutes, dozens of reinforcements had arrived. As they entered the arena to provide a counterweight to the GOP observers inside, Reyes took down their cell-phone numbers and added them to a massive text chain. Racial-justice activists from Detroit Will Breathe worked alongside suburban women from Fems for Dems and local elected officials. Reyes left at 3 a.m., handing the text chain over to a disability activist. As they mapped out the steps in the election-certification process, activists settled on a strategy of foregrounding the people’s right to decide, demanding their voices be heard and calling attention to the racial implications of disenfranchising Black Detroiters. They flooded the Wayne County canvassing board’s Nov. 17 certification meeting with on-message testimony; despite a Trump tweet, the Republican board members certified Detroit’s votes. Election boards were one pressure point; another was GOP-controlled legislatures, who Trump believed could declare the election void and appoint their own electors. And so the President invited the GOP leaders of the Michigan legislature, House Speaker Lee Chatfield and Senate majority leader Mike Shirkey, to Washington on Nov. 20. It was a perilous moment. If Chatfield and Shirkey agreed to do Trump’s bidding, Republicans in other states might be similarly bullied. “I was concerned things were going to get weird,” says Jeff Timmer, a former Michigan GOP executive director turned anti-Trump activist. Norm Eisen describes it as “the scariest moment” of the entire election. The democracy defenders launched a full-court press. Protect Democracy’s local contacts researched the lawmakers’ personal and political motives. Issue One ran television ads in Lansing. The Chamber’s Bradley kept close tabs on the process. Wamp, the former Republican Congressman, called his former colleague Mike Rogers, who wrote an op-ed for the Detroit newspapers urging officials to honor the will of the voters. Three former Michigan governors–Republicans John Engler and Rick Snyder and Democrat Jennifer Granholm–jointly called for Michigan’s electoral votes to be cast free of pressure from the White House. Engler, a former head of the Business Roundtable, made phone calls to influential donors and fellow GOP elder statesmen who could press the lawmakers privately. The pro-democracy forces were up against a Trumpified Michigan GOP controlled by allies of Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, and Betsy DeVos, the former Education Secretary and a member of a billionaire family of GOP donors. On a call with his team on Nov. 18, Bassin vented that his side’s pressure was no match for what Trump could offer. “Of course he’s going to try to offer them something,” Bassin recalls thinking. “Head of the Space Force! Ambassador to wherever! We can’t compete with that by offering carrots. We need a stick.” If Trump were to offer something in exchange for a personal favor, that would likely constitute bribery, Bassin reasoned. He phoned Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan, to see if Primus agreed and would make the argument publicly. Primus said he thought the meeting itself was inappropriate, and got to work on an op-ed for Politico warning that the state attorney general–a Democrat–would have no choice but to investigate. When the piece posted on Nov. 19, the attorney general’s communications director tweeted it. Protect Democracy soon got word that the lawmakers planned to bring lawyers to the meeting with Trump the next day. Reyes’ activists scanned flight schedules and flocked to the airports on both ends of Shirkey’s journey to D.C., to underscore that the lawmakers were being scrutinized. After the meeting, the pair announced they’d pressed the President to deliver COVID relief for their constituents and informed him they saw no role in the election process. Then they went for a drink at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A street artist projected their images onto the outside of the building along with the words THE WORLD IS WATCHING. That left one last step: the state canvassing board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans. One Republican, a Trumper employed by the DeVos family’s political nonprofit, was not expected to vote for certification. The other Republican on the board was a little-known lawyer named Aaron Van Langevelde. He sent no signals about what he planned to do, leaving everyone on edge. When the meeting began, Reyes’s activists flooded the livestream and filled Twitter with their hashtag, #alleyesonmi. A board accustomed to attendance in the single digits suddenly faced an audience of thousands. In hours of testimony, the activists emphasized their message of respecting voters’ wishes and affirming democracy rather than scolding the officials. Van Langevelde quickly signaled he would follow precedent. The vote was 3-0 to certify; the other Republican abstained. After that, the dominoes fell. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the rest of the states certified their electors. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia stood up to Trump’s bullying. And the Electoral College voted on schedule on Dec. 14. There was one last milestone on Podhorzer’s mind: Jan. 6. On the day Congress would meet to tally the electoral count, Trump summoned his supporters to D.C. for a rally. Much to their surprise, the thousands who answered his call were met by virtually no counterdemonstrators. To preserve safety and ensure they couldn’t be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was “strenuously discouraging counter activity,” Podhorzer texted me the morning of Jan. 6, with a crossed-fingers emoji. Trump addressed the crowd that afternoon, peddling the lie that lawmakers or Vice President Mike Pence could reject states’ electoral votes. He told them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building. As lawmakers fled for their lives and his own supporters were shot and trampled, Trump praised the rioters as “very special.” It was his final attack on democracy, and once again, it failed. By standing down, the democracy campaigners outfoxed their foes. “We won by the skin of our teeth, honestly, and that’s an important point for folks to sit with,” says the Democracy Defense Coalition’s Peoples. “There’s an impulse for some to say voters decided and democracy won. But it’s a mistake to think that this election cycle was a show of strength for democracy. It shows how vulnerable democracy is.” The members of the alliance to protect the election have gone their separate ways. The Democracy Defense Coalition has been disbanded, though the Fight Back Table lives on. Protect Democracy and the good-government advocates have turned their attention to pressing reforms in Congress. Left-wing activists are pressuring the newly empowered Democrats to remember the voters who put them there, while civil rights groups are on guard against further attacks on voting. Business leaders denounced the Jan. 6 attack, and some say they will no longer donate to lawmakers who refused to certify Biden’s victory. Podhorzer and his allies are still holding their Zoom strategy sessions, gauging voters’ views and developing new messages. And Trump is in Florida, facing his second impeachment, deprived of the Twitter and Facebook accounts he used to push the nation to its breaking point. As I was reporting this article in November and December, I heard different claims about who should get the credit for thwarting Trump’s plot. Liberals argued the role of bottom-up people power shouldn’t be overlooked, particularly the contributions of people of color and local grassroots activists. Others stressed the heroism of GOP officials like Van Langevelde and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who stood up to Trump at considerable cost. The truth is that neither likely could have succeeded without the other. “It’s astounding how close we came, how fragile all this really is,” says Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director. “It’s like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff–if you don’t look down, you don’t fall. Our democracy only survives if we all believe and don’t look down.” Democracy won in the end. The will of the people prevailed.

,,"Jurors, not voters, could give Biden a second term","The odds now favor a Donald Trump vs. Joe Biden general election, the match-up many voters have long dreaded. Even with Nikki Haley continuing her spirited campaign, and many Democrats still hoping Biden bows out, the final field is rapidly taking form. Add up everything – polls, issues, and public perceptions that Biden is too old – and the Democratic president is clearly in deep trouble. Trump leads him in most national and swing state polls. Only 34% of voters in the recent CNN survey believe Biden “deserves reelection,” while 66% say he doesn’t. Another drag on the Democratic ticket is Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, who has a dismal positive rating of 28%. On policy issues, according to the latest NBC News poll, Trump beats Biden on “securing the border and controlling immigration” by a towering 35 points. It’s a wonder that Democrats, who’ve had the White House for three years, have allowed this issue to spin so far out of control. It’s yet to be seen if Republican maneuvering over recent border legislation, nakedly partisan as it was, changes the dynamic.  Trump also wins on “dealing with the economy” by 22 points, a wide gap given recently improved economic data. On being “competent and effective,” Trump leads Biden by 21 points, a change from four years ago when competence was viewed as a Biden strength.  On “improving America’s standing in the world,” an increasingly vital concern given current wars, Trump leads by 11 points. Biden, however, wins on “protecting democracy,” but by only 2 points, a thin edge considering that Democrats have made this topic a centerpiece of their campaign.  Biden’s best issue is abortion, which he wins by 12 points over Trump – a big enough margin to make a difference. But can Democrats hold the White House and Congress on the basis of abortion policy alone? What does all this mean? Is Trump headed back to the White House? Not necessarily. Trump is burdened with his own high negatives; don’t forget that he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million in 2016 and by 7 million in 2020. Most importantly, remember that Trump is strapped to a railroad track awaiting a freight train labeled “91 Felony Counts” coming toward him. He may be able to free himself in time, but then again, he may not.  Nine months remain before the November election, so it’s possible that at least one of Trump’s criminal trials will be completed by then. If Trump is found guilty, millions of undecided voters will ask themselves: Can I vote for a convicted felon to be President of the United States?  The recent Bloomberg/Morning Consult poll of seven critical swing states shows Trump receiving 48% of the combined vote and Biden getting 42%. The survey also finds that if Trump is convicted of a crime, 18% of his own voters in these key states would be unwilling, very or somewhat, to stick with him. That may seem like a small number, but in electoral terms, it could be decisive: If Trump loses 18% of his current vote in swing states, he drops from 48% to a little over 39% – a number low enough for Biden, at 42%, to overtake him. You ask: If Trump loses votes based on a guilty verdict, where would these voters go? Biden wouldn’t get many, if any. A portion could stay home and not vote, which hurts Republican candidates down ballot. The biggest chunk of disaffected Trump voters would likely move to independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr., who Republicans regard favorably and widely view as a protest vehicle. Bloomberg/Morning Consult polling finds that 50% of Trump’s current supporters in key states have positive feelings toward Kennedy, with far fewer holding negative views.  This scenario, far from certain but still possible, would give Kennedy a chance to run up his vote total higher than current polls indicate. But as long as the race is seen as a competitive Trump-Biden contest, any Trump losses ultimately help Biden win. Who would have thought a president’s best chance for reelection would come from the votes of a jury? Ron Faucheux is a nonpartisan political analyst, pollster, and writer.

,,,"Donald Trump’s supporters propelled him to about a 10-point victory over Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. Here, Trump speaks at an election night party in Nashua, N.H., as Vivek Ramaswamy (from left), Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Eric Trump watch. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Donald Trump won Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary by more than 10 points over Nikki Haley (54.5 to 43.2 percent) and will now sweep his way easily to the nomination. Or not. The first scenario seemed to be the general consensus of media pundits, but some noted that Trump only attracted about half of GOP voters in the N.H. primary and Iowa caucus, raising questions about how he would fare in the general election. And Haley has vowed to fight on. The next Republican primary is in her home state, South Carolina, but Trump is favored there, too. (President Biden, meanwhile, handily won the Democratic race in New Hampshire, even though voters had to write his name in.) We asked a handful of BU experts to help us sort out the results from a variety of perspectives. Tammy Vigil, associate professor of media science and senior associate dean, College of Communication: 
Despite the win in New Hampshire, the results actually illustrate weaknesses in Trump’s candidacy. The likelihood Trump will secure the Republican nomination remains high, but Tuesday’s outcome revealed distinct fissures within the Republican ranks that could provide some strategic insights for Haley now and Biden during the general election. According to exit polling, Trump is not drawing support from moderate conservatives, and a high number of New Hampshire GOP voters selected Haley to indicate their opposition to Trump. Haley should more earnestly court disaffected Republicans moving forward; Biden also needs to build a space for them in his campaign.

Christine Slaughter, assistant professor of political science, College of Arts & Sciences:
Many Republican voters are looking toward the general election, presuming that Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee. The path forward for Haley looks ragged. As former South Carolina governor, losing the Republican primary would be a final dagger to her campaign. The majority of Iowa and N.H. voters support Trump and, apparently, three of his former competitors also support his candidacy. There’s enthusiasm for him, as if he’s the incumbent.

Bruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History, College of Arts & Sciences:
It was a bad [boring] night for journalists as the results came in more or less as expected. Trump won decisively but not overwhelmingly, in a contest that figured to play more to Haley’s strengths than most other Republican primaries, while Haley finished well enough to stay in the race. The only question is whether Haley will stay in for the long haul hoping that Trump’s legal worries damage his candidacy, or whether she’ll drop out after the next contested race in South Carolina.

Paul Hare, senior lecturer in international relations, Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, and former British ambassador to Cuba:
Most Republicans agree with Trump that foreign policy is a minor issue. For Trump, it’s personal. On Ukraine, Zelensky would not “do him a favor” over Hunter Biden. [As president, Trump asked Ukraine’s leader to investigate the younger Biden.] Trump likes Putin because Putin likes him. He dislikes Netanyahu because he congratulated Biden [on Biden’s 2020 win]. Trump wants to block Biden’s bipartisan deal on immigration and aid to Ukraine/Israel. He needs the US border issue to fester. Haley recognized US interests in foreign policy, but most Republicans see Democrats as the threat. Saudi Arabia is now the Trump family’s main business partner—in massive Saudi resort and sports deals and billions in investment funds.

Shawn M. Lynch, senior lecturer in social sciences, College of General Studies:
Haley did well among independents, which is trouble for Trump, but she cannot win the nomination. There is no Republican Party any longer, there is only the Trump Party. The Trump “Republican” electorate will not vote for a person of color over Trump. This party will, however, nominate someone who is a convicted rapist and utter incompetent facing 91 felony charges, who may well be in prison by November. The party and its MAGA base have chosen electoral suicide.

Rachel Meade, lecturer in political sciences, College of Arts & Sciences:
This means that Trump is very likely to be the nominee and Haley has become a long-shot candidate. If she can’t win in a state with so many independent voters (when her polling is strongest among independents), then it is unlikely she can win in states with a more traditional Republican voter base. However, this is not a normal election cycle in that the front-runner is under multiple indictments, with the January 6 trial scheduled to start during the primary season. Haley may be staying in the race so she could be poised as next in line in case a dramatic legal development changes Trump’s support base or causes the GOP to drop him. Even so, this looks like a long shot as his base has shown that they mostly see the trials as an example of politically motivated elites going after a leader that they see as a threat. Vigil: As a write-in candidate who didn’t officially campaign in New Hampshire, Joe Biden secured over half of the Democratic votes on Tuesday and earned more than double the combined votes cast for Dean Phillips and [Marianne] Williamson in a decisive, and completely unsurprising, result. As expected, Tuesday’s outcome indicates that neither Phillips nor Williamson are viable Democratic contenders. More revealing is how the GOP primary results could inform Biden’s general election campaign. Similar to 2020, there is a clear opportunity to earn significant votes from anti-Trump Republicans, but Biden will need to be strategic about building bipartisan appeals while coalition-building.

Slaughter: There’s about a 10 percent margin between Haley and Trump in N.H. The primary set a turnout record—with many Trump supporters and voters seeking an alternative in Haley. N.H. is a competitive state, so hopefully Biden can appeal to N.H. voters who are opposed to Trump. Processing write-in ballots takes time, so it is not yet known for sure how well or how poorly Biden fared in N.H., but he had an overwhelming victory in the votes that have been counted.

Schulman: The Democratic results mean little, but if I were Biden’s campaign manager, my line would be: “Biden outperformed Trump in New Hampshire and he wasn’t even on the ballot!”

Hare: Biden got what he wanted: a Trump rematch. Haley showed independents are overwhelmingly against Trump. Biden was fearful of having to face a moderate Haley. Trump, however, has shown most Republicans now believe something Trump himself didn’t believe. His chief of staff and his daughter have testified that Trump knew he lost to Biden. But now millions are pouring money into his coffers because they see the 2020 election as stolen—just like Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his support doesn’t waver. But, as Haley remarked in New Hampshire, a Trump victory is what Democrats have been working for.

Lynch: I did not vote for Biden or Trump, but Joe Biden is the most competent president of my lifetime (1971 onward). He will win the November election in a landslide, presuming the contest is Biden vs. Trump. This is because the people that hate Trump hate him more than the people who love Trump love him. Independents have abandoned him (and will continue to do so), and there are too many people who will crawl over broken glass to keep him out of the White House. Besides, he’ll likely be imprisoned by the date of the election, and this will not expand his support.

Meade: Democrats should be focusing on the most likely scenario: a rematch with Donald Trump. They might also note the limits of an anti-Trump, pro-democracy messaging strategy, since Haley has recently been pushing something similar. Democrats will also need to show why they will be affirmatively better for voters than Trump would be—for example, by highlighting specific policies that benefit their constituencies, from the American Rescue Plan or Build Back Better Act. The MAGA base is different from the traditional GOP in having more isolationist foreign policy and more openness to social and economic spending. This can be seen in Trump’s anti-Haley ad in New Hampshire accusing her of wanting to cut Social Security [funding], and that is the area where Biden might be able to make a similar attack on Trump. Vigil: They might not. Edison Research’s exit polling shows Trump’s strength remains his core followers and that many New Hampshire primary participants were motivated opposition voters supporting Haley to register antipathy toward Trump. Trump’s current campaign messaging contains very few efforts to expand his appeal beyond the MAGA faithful—a strategy he also employed in 2020. Sticking with this approach, to win the general election, Trump will have to rely on voters abandoning Biden. While that could happen, it is a risky game plan, since failure to attract moderate Republicans and unaffiliated voters narrows Trump’s potential margin for victory. 

Slaughter: Turnout in midterm elections is generally lower than in presidential elections. This election is unprecedented, since Trump is facing criminal indictments and is the first former president to face criminal charges. This is his third presidential campaign. Campaigning will look different since court dates are approaching. It’s clear that despite his legal troubles, and attempt to overthrow the government on January 6, there are still voters and other politicians that support his third presidential bid.

Schulman: I would challenge the premises of this question. If you’re asking whether Trump (or Trumpist candidates) can win a majority of the popular vote, the answer is no. Trump will lose the popular vote by a wide margin, as he did in both 2016 and 2020. But the presidential contest will be decided in a handful of states, all of which Biden won very narrowly in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Whichever candidate takes three of those five states will win the election. So, Trump could still win the presidency even though I think Biden will handily win the popular vote.

Hare: History suggests there is never going to be a MAGA majority in the US. Trump lost by three million popular votes to Hillary Clinton and eight million to Biden. But, of course, a few states could be rogue outliers. So, 10,000 votes in Georgia, Michigan, or Arizona could decide the election. And America’s justice system may simply be too slow and incompetent to bring to trial Trump’s serious election indictments. They will prove, whatever legal boffins may say, that Trump truly is immune from prosecution. It’s that Fifth Avenue thing again.

Lynch: The Republican Party is dead and will likely be wiped out nationally in November. They will certainly lose control of the House and will not take the Senate. Biden will crush Trump. The party of Reagan and Bush is dead. It surrendered to an incompetent, narcissistic sociopath and adopted irrational, violent, and hateful politics. Good riddance. I feel it likely that some Republican states will refuse to accept the loss and begin talking secession after the election. They have nowhere else to go, with Trump definitively defeated. (Knock on wood!)

Meade: The failure of Trump to get his chosen candidates elected in midterm elections doesn’t necessarily tell us that much about how he would fare running himself. Populist charismatic appeals are usually quite specific to the individual and hard to transfer to someone else, and in Trump’s case, relates to his “outsider” reality TV and business background and unique speaking style and sense of humor. In terms of a repeat of 2020, there are some important differences there too. We are now in a post January 6 landscape, and Trump is under multiple indictments, with trials or even convictions possible by the general election, all of which could potentially benefit Biden. On the other hand, Trump has been out of the public eye long enough, particularly given not being on X (formerly Twitter), and not participating in the primary debates, that the chaos which comes with a Trump presidency and which turned off some of his own voters is less salient. Also, Biden is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm in his own base. In addition to concerns about his age, many younger voters on the left are very unhappy with how he has handled the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dissatisfaction with both Trump and Biden as candidates could also draw a higher than usual third party vote, and I think RFK, Jr., who has an outsider appeal that draws from both left and right, is particularly important to watch.

As usual, the ‘panel of BU experts’ skips over several MAJOR points in its zeal to carry water for their preferred candidate .. Trump set a record in IA with his win there .. he won 98 of 99 counties, and gather more support than any other R candidate EVER. In N.H., Trump earned just over 100k votes in 2016 .. he got about 130k votes in 2020 .. and he will get about 170k this year, again, another record if I’m not mistaken. Haley benefitted greatly from the stupid ‘open primary’ rules in N.H. .. just like the Rs played games with Hillary and Obama in the past, the Ds played games with Trump in this cycle .. 7 of 10 voters for Haley weren’t even register Rs. Trump has incredible momentum at the moment, with his overall approval rating RISING, while Biden’s approval rating is LOWER than any other candidate EVER. Trump is out polling Biden in EVERY swing state, and in several BY A LOT .. and polling has almost always favored D candidates (remember Hillary had a near certain victory before she didn’t). I could keep going, but endeavoring to reason with partisan liberals is a fools exercise .., but lastly, not a single panel member mentioned that the Ds have shunned RFK JR, a VERY formidable candidate, who will most surely take votes from Biden who at this point is nearly incapable of campaigning. And to the panelist who referred to Biden as The Best President, blah, blah, blah .. you can’t be serious .. we now have an OPEN southern border that’s been breached somewhere between 8-12 MILLION times under Joe’s regime, major crime statistics that have clobbered EVERY major city and far too many rural areas, there are now wars raging in several countries (there were no new wars under Trump, vs several under Biden), potentially crippling Fed funds/interest rates, raging inflation, etc etc etc .. this administration is an unmitigated disaster. My guess is that you won’t share this, as censoring seems to be the way at the new BU – which is far different from the old BU, where differing views were shared. Last time I checked the US still had 48 more states yet to vote. Presuming Iowa and NH are representative of all the rest, we can skip the others — maybe scrap the primary system in the future, just let those two states decide for us all — leaving us with a choice between the inept Biden and the arrogant Trump. The only person in the country with a chance of losing to Biden is Trump.

Ambassador Hare says “Most Republicans agree with Trump that foreign policy is a minor issue.” He needs to meet some Republicans (I’m available). And it’d be nice if he represented Trump fairly on this. Shawn Lynch says the ‘Trump “Republican” will not vote for a person of color over Trump.’ Pretty vile smear, Shawn, not worthy of a faculty member at a distinguished university. Same advice: You need to meet some Republicans (I’m available, subject to an apology for the smear). The braying of like-minded ideologues with distant or no practical experience in the focus of which they opine shouldn’t be presented as expertise.

,,,"                         64     by AHTRA ELNASHAR | The National Desk WASHINGTON (TND) — Voters in Michigan who are angry with President Joe Biden over his support for Israel have sent his campaign a loud and clear message: He cannot take their support for granted. An effort to protest the president by voting ""uncommitted"" in the state's presidential primary -- called the 'Listen to Michigan' campaign -- on Feb. 27 gained momentum after prominent progressive organization Our Revolution announced its support for the plan. ""Tell Biden, stop the death and destruction now"" the group's pledge sign up page reads. Attendees wave flags and fly signs during a rally in support of Palestine in Dearborn, Detroit on Oct. 10, 2023. (Matthew Hatcher/Detroit News via AP) As of Monday, the death toll in Gaza since October 7 exceeded 29,000, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. While some staunch critics refuse to recognize any statistics from Hamas, the United Nations has said the ministry's figures have been historically consistent with their own. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has also endorsed the protest vote. The president is aware of the pushback: Earlier this month he sent top aides to Michigan to meet with Arab and Muslim community leaders. Those two groups represent a voting bloc Biden cannot afford to lose. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 206,000 Muslim registered voters, according to Emgage, a network of organizations focused on Muslim political engagement. Biden's attempt at outreach also comes after a November poll from the Arab American Institute found that his support among Arab voters plummeted from 2020, especially in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, when it was 60% to a mere 19%. Amana Ali joins about three dozen people protesting Israel's attacks in Gaza, Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024 in Dearborn, Mich. The protesters gathered hoping to be heard by members of the Biden White House who were scheduled to meet in suburban Detroit with Muslim and Arab American leaders. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said she's had tough conversations with the president about this. ""I’ve got a lot of constituents, a lot of people that are neighbors and friends who are hurting, who have lost family, are scared for their family who have no food, no health care, no water. This is an issue that he’s got to talk about with people head-on. Donald Trump doesn’t offer any solutions, either,"" Dingell said in an interview with Fox News Monday. Some Democrats, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who also serves as co-chair for Biden's reelection campaign, have urged members of her party to keep up their support for the president instead of inadvertently helping former President Donald Trump, who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. El-Sayed pushed back on criticism that it will benefit Trump, emphasizing the protest vote's focus is on the Democratic primary, not necessarily the general election. ""While it’s clear that Biden will win the primary, it’s critical for him and his team to understand that votes in November have to be EARNED. And by voting uncommitted, I have the opportunity to count myself among the votes he’s putting in jeopardy in November,"" El-Sayed said in his post.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) The Biden administration has been resolute in its support for Israel, even as global outrage grows over the staggering death toll and displacement of civilians in Gaza. Biden's harshest public remarks about Israel came earlier this month when he called its conduct in the Gaza Strip ""over the top."" In private, Biden reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “pain in my a**."" The U.S., along with Qatar and Egypt, have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel on a potential deal for the release of hostages in exchange for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the president has not joined calls by other world leaders in calling for a permanent ceasefire.

,,"I Love You, Please Vote For Biden"," If you’ve ever had a family Thanksgiving turn nuclear after Aunt Helen decided to share her opinion on All Lives Matter during the dessert course, you know it can be extremely difficult to change your loved ones’ minds about deeply held political views. But talking about these subjects with close friends and family doesn’t always lead to slammed screen doors and smashed pie plates. Sometimes these relationships provide a way into perspective-shifting conversations that might otherwise be impossible. “There is someone in your life that only you can get through to,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “I need you to use your relationships to get through and check in on people and make sure they’re stepping up and doing the right thing, and they’re not staying home on Election Night, and they’re not giving their vote to Donald Trump.” The Cut talked to seven people about how they got through to that person in their lives — from jaded nonvoters to disillusioned Republicans — and convinced them to cast their vote for Joe Biden this fall. As 15-year-old Claire said of getting her Republican grandma in Florida to vote for Biden, that personal closeness can make all the difference: “She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true.” Interviews have been edited for length and clarity, and names have been changed. My dad used to be a Republican congressman. Our family always grew up pretty conservative, though it sure feels, as I get older, I’m becoming more liberal, especially with Trump in power. I think Trump is an absolute menace. There’s no way I would ever have voted for him. In 2016, I did a write-in for John Kasich, but this year I’m voting for Biden. My brother’s a retired banker down in Dallas, and he’s ten years older than me. He’s a conservative Republican, he’s a loyal soldier for the party, but he also believes Trump is a moron. He knew he wasn’t gonna vote for Trump this time; he was planning to write in Reagan’s name. And I just started pleading with him, saying, “Texas is in play. The state is so close. And if the Republicans can lose Texas, maybe that’s a wake-up call for them to get their act together.” The Republicans are pulling out every dirty trick they can to suppress voting and try and save this guy’s bacon. And I said, “You can’t just vote for Reagan or Ross Perot and feel good about it.” We talk probably three times a week on the phone, if not more. His wife is also a conservative Republican, and she can’t stand Trump, like me. She and I weren’t plotting together, but it was definitely a tag-team effort. I think my brother’s a smart guy. He’s not a fan of Joe Biden [politically], but he believes he’s a decent human being and a good man. And I think he knows that the country’s in a bad place right now and we do have to put country over party. I live in rural Pennsylvania. It’s very red, and I was a big Trump supporter in 2016 when I was in high school. As the years went on, I started to drift away, and I finally turned and got on the Bidenmobile in about September. COVID-19 was kind of the final straw for me. Other countries have beaten this back, and we’re climbing like crazy. I also personally feel like, as someone who studies climate change and someone who is LGBTQ, another four years with Donald Trump in the White House is not the best for a person like me. When I first supported Trump, I did not realize I was LGBTQ, and I wasn’t nearly as much of an environmentalist as I am now. My boyfriend and I met in 2019 and started dating this spring. He had been a Trump supporter but was increasingly on the fence, and he was starting to show the early signs of getting annoyed with Trump’s rhetoric. Still, he said he wasn’t going to break his back going to the polls, but if he did manage to go, he was gonna vote Trump, just do a straight red ticket. And then that’s when I kind of threw a lot of persuasion at him. It started as a little bit of joking banter, like, “Vote for Biden and I’ll buy you this.” And then eventually, I kind of got to him. I helped him realize that, of the two main options available, Biden was the lesser of two evils. I said, “Do you want to spend the next four years reading angry tweets and opening up Twitter and saying, ‘Oh, what did Trump do now?’” I think the first debate also really helped convince him because Trump spent the entire time attacking Joe Biden’s son and Joe Biden as a person, and I think he felt that Biden at least portrayed an ounce of professionalism that was desperately needed. He kind of just said, “Fine, finally I get it, I’ll do it.”  My son is in the National Guard; he’s 21. He’s like a lot of people in that generation, where they think it doesn’t really matter. He’s pretty progressive, he supported Bernie, and none of his friends are voting, because they don’t like Biden either. But he’s been activated four times now during COVID, for protests in Seattle and for COVID relief, doing testing and food banks, and he’ll be activated for the election, for whatever may or may not happen. In encouraging him to vote, I said, “Remember, you’re also voting for your boss, because we also have a tight gubernatorial race.” I told him, you know, “If we get a conservative governor here, that guy is gonna activate you every time somebody breathes wrong.” He doesn’t want to be at those protests; if he had his way, he’d likely be on the other side of them. I’ve voted in every election since I turned 18, but this is his first presidential election. It’s hard to convey to him how different this election is from any other during my lifetime, and he really doesn’t have the luxury of standing idly by, waiting for a better candidate. He got his ballot, and I was like, “Are you gonna fill it out?” I said, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, but this is why I really want you to vote for Biden.” And he did it. My grandma lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She has been a Republican pretty much her whole life, but she did not agree with what Trump was doing with COVID, because she’s older and she’s immunocompromised. I FaceTime her every Sunday for about an hour. A year ago, we didn’t really talk about politics. But in the past couple months, I’ve been trying to incorporate it a little bit more because I had a feeling that she wasn’t going to vote. I tried to show her that not everyone has benefited from Trump being president. For example, she is upper class, and my mom and dad and brother are not, and I kind of showed her that not taxing everyone equally is not effective. And she said she never thought about how taxing the upper class would be helpful to everybody else. Especially with Black Lives Matter becoming bigger this year, I think she also realized that racism is a really big problem. Where she lives, it’s mostly white people, and she hasn’t lived with other minorities in a really long time. And I started explaining the protests and how police were targeting Black people, because I don’t think she really understood. Recently, she told me that she was going to vote for Biden because she believes Trump is evil and it’s the right thing to do, not only thinking about herself but thinking about everybody. It was awesome.
Me and her have gotten really close. And I think that us being really close really helped me convince her, because she trusts me and respects my opinion. She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true. I tried to get my dad to vote blue in 2016. I don’t think that worked — he still hasn’t really said who he voted for, but I think he has pretty much always voted Republican. Since then, anytime I thought Trump did something dumb, I would try to start a conversation, and that didn’t really work. But as this election got closer, I was really trying to tell him about how important it would be for my future and potentially my kids’ future if I have kids. Millennials have this idea that it’s not ethical to necessarily bring kids into the world when there are politicians in office that don’t believe in climate change. He thought that idea was really out there, and he said he couldn’t believe I thought that way. He thought that’s kind of a crazy way to think about having kids, like it doesn’t really matter who’s in office, you’re gonna live your life. Marrying those things together, I think, was probably a new concept for him. He did definitely push back and say that’s not the way to think about having kids, and I said, “Well, that’s the way that I’m thinking about it, and you could help with this if you voted for Biden. That would be a step in the right direction.”   While he was never interested in talking about me having grandkids before, the past few years he has kind of been asking me what’s going on. Prior to that, I would have never thought that could be a way in. My mom sent me a photo of his completed ballot [for Biden]; he wouldn’t send it to me. I think he’s still begrudgingly doing it, and that doesn’t feel great, but I guess a win’s a win. The majority of my family is completely out of touch with politics. They don’t understand how policies and the people we elect can affect their lives. They just tend to complain. My sister hasn’t voted in over 30 years. She does watch TV, but because Trump has so dominated the airwaves, she’s just sick and tired of it. She was just frustrated by his childish behavior. And I said, “Let’s do something about it. You need to go vote.” And she’s like, “Dan, I haven’t voted in years, and I’m blind.” She actually went blind this past year because of diabetes, and she’s only gone blind in the last six or seven months so she’s still struggling with how to live this way. So I printed off the Missouri absentee ballot application and sent her hard copies of it, and I walked her through the ballot and explained how to get it submitted in Missouri and all that. And because I went to the effort to make it easier for her, she was motivated to follow through, but I did have to lead her every step of the way. Miranda and I have been friends since we were next-door neighbors in second grade. We can talk about anything without being judgmental. I’ve always called her my one Republican friend, and she’s always called me her tree-hugging friend. Politics was never a major topic of discussion for us. Of course, Trump has changed that. I sort of explained to her what’s happening around the world and showed how fascism and authoritarianism are rising up everywhere, like Hungary, Poland, Brazil, Turkey, India, and I started naming off all the countries that have fallen to authoritarian regimes over the last decade and kind of brought it back home. One of my children has Jewish heritage, and one of my children has Muslim heritage and I sort of explained to her how terrified I am for them. We’re applying, through my husband, for Italian citizenship. That’s how scared we are. I think that sort of brought it home to a personal level. I remember we were talking about race issues, and I tried to explain it very simply. I said, “Miranda, do you think that you would have the same life if you had been born to the same parents and lived in the same house next door to me and everything was the same except you were Black instead of white?” And I think she was able to realize that no, she wouldn’t have had the same life — like my parents back then wouldn’t have let me be friends with her. I come from a very racist family, and things wouldn’t have been the same. I feel like if I were to go to a Trump supporter that I ran into who didn’t love me, it’s futile for me to waste my breath trying to convince them of anything. But Miranda knows me, and I feel like you can convince the people that love you. Really the only way I’ve been able to reach people is “If you believe this is happening, or if you believe it could be happening, and if you love me, don’t you care about what that’s gonna mean?” Because our family, I feel like, is in a particularly vulnerable spot. That’s how I got through to her.   Limited-time offer: Join today and get two free gifts — our new Cut tote and the Spring Fashion Issue.

,,Mad Poll Disease is making Democrats misread voter opinion,"Horserace polling can’t tell us anything new about who will win the electoral college – but the existence of an anti-Maga majority is clear N
ow that Thanksgiving has passed in America, and everyone’s Trumpy uncle is on his way back to his conservative state, we still have our catastrophizing Democratic cousins to contend with. Triggered by the drumbeat of horrific poll results, they are panicking that Joe Biden is too old and unpopular to prevent a second Trump administration from taking power. These cousins, and perhaps you too, are suffering from the latest strain of what I call Mad Poll Disease. It’s a perpetual state of anxiety – spread by the media’s obsession with using polls to forecast the outcome of the next election, instead of empowering voters with all the information they need to decide what they want that outcome to be and act, or vote, accordingly. To cure Mad Poll Disease, start by making this your mantra: Horserace polling can’t tell us anything we don’t already know before election day about who will win the electoral college. We know it will be close. We know it will be decided by six swing states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin). Importantly, these states were so close that even the best polls couldn’t call all of them the day before the 2016, 2020 or 2022 elections. In both 2016 and 2020, the margin of victory in most of them was less than one point. If you had clicked on FiveThirtyEight in June 2022, you would have thought Republicans had a 60% chance of controlling the Senate, in September that Democrats had a 70% chance of holding the Senate, and on election day, that Republican had a 60% chance of flipping it again. But in the real world, Democrats increased their Senate majority. Trying to use horserace polls to project the winner in swing states is like trying to predict the weather nine months from now by taking the temperature outside today. Elections come down to turnout, and what that will look like on election day is truly anyone’s guess. Taking the temperature of how voters feel today doesn’t tell us how they’ll feel a year from now – much less whether they will act on those feelings by turning out to vote, or for whom they’ll vote if they do. So why the scary numbers? Pollsters want voters to tell them who they will vote for next November; voters want to tell pollsters how unsatisfied they are now with the direction of the country and their own lives. For most of this century, Americans have said the country was on the wrong track – and they have taken out those broader frustrations on whoever was president at the time. Low presidential approval ratings are now the norm in the United States (for old and young presidents alike), in a stark contrast to the last century. And other world leaders aren’t faring well either. Of the seven countries regularly surveyed by Morning Consult, only the Swiss have positive feelings about their leader and their country’s direction. But when it comes time to cast a ballot, voters understand the stakes. This is where we can really tell those cousins to take heart: ever since Trump’s shocking win in 2016, many Americans who thought elections didn’t matter realized that they very much do. Most Americans reject everything Trump and Maga stand for – taking away our freedoms, filling the government with incompetent lackeys, and ruling with hate and fear. An anti-Maga majority was born, and it has turned out to vote in record numbers again and again. This has been a predictable weather pattern since 2018, but most pollsters and pundits fail to account for it. Remember how 2022 was supposed to be a Red Wave, but it never materialized? Actually, it did – in 35 states. But in the other 15 states, where a prominent Maga candidate was running, we saw numbers more like the 2018 Blue Wave. Where voters understood the anti-Maga stakes, they turned out. This allowed Democrats to keep the Senate. When Democrats lost the House, it was by a much narrower margin than pundits expected. And it could have gone the other way had anti-Maga voters in California, New Jersey and New York understood what similar voters in the states with key Senate races understood – that staying home was voting for Maga to control the chamber. As a practical matter, only Biden can decide not to run, and he shouldn’t base that decision on fear of bad polls. Polls can mislead us into making unforced errors. We hear a lot about how risky it is to run an 81-year-old candidate with bad poll numbers. What about how risky it would be to replace someone who has beaten Trump before, and who has already been defined by both left and right, with someone who hasn’t? It would be an absurd gamble – like doubling down on your bet when you haven’t seen any of your own cards yet. It’s even more absurd to focus on this when we still have a year of news headlines in front of us. As we saw after Roe v Wade was overturned, there is a huge difference between knowing intellectually that something could happen, and actually living in the world where it is happening. It’s not news to most people that Trump will stand trial for multiple criminal indictments next year. But none of us can fully feel the way we will about it once we are reminded every day of Trump’s crimes against the country. To be clear, I’m not saying that Biden is going to win – just that there’s no reason to declare him likely to lose. But media outlets create this narrative out of thin air when they choose to field and devote so many headlines to horserace polls a year out from the election. This saps our agency as voters by creating a false sense of inevitability about the final outcome. And it steals oxygen from coverage of why an election matters – the real stakes to voters’ lives. We know what those stakes are because we have lived through some of them. We know how much worse Trump and Maga are promising to do. Our duty, not as Democratic partisans but as small-d democratic partisans, is to put in the work to make sure every voter understands the choice ahead.

,,,"                         40     by AHTRA ELNASHAR | The National Desk WASHINGTON (TND) — Voters in Michigan who are angry with President Joe Biden over his support for Israel have sent his campaign a loud and clear message: He cannot take their support for granted. An effort to protest the president by voting ""uncommitted"" in the state's presidential primary -- called the 'Listen to Michigan' campaign -- on Feb. 27 gained momentum after prominent progressive organization Our Revolution announced its support for the plan. ""Tell Biden, stop the death and destruction now"" the group's pledge sign up page reads. Attendees wave flags and fly signs during a rally in support of Palestine in Dearborn, Detroit on Oct. 10, 2023. (Matthew Hatcher/Detroit News via AP) As of Monday, the death toll in Gaza since October 7 exceeded 29,000, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. While some staunch critics refuse to recognize any statistics from Hamas, the United Nations has said the ministry's figures have been historically consistent with their own. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has also endorsed the protest vote. The president is aware of the pushback: Earlier this month he sent top aides to Michigan to meet with Arab and Muslim community leaders. Those two groups represent a voting bloc Biden cannot afford to lose. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 206,000 Muslim registered voters, according to Emgage, a network of organizations focused on Muslim political engagement. Biden's attempt at outreach also comes after a November poll from the Arab American Institute found that his support among Arab voters plummeted from 2020, especially in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, when it was 60% to a mere 19%.

Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said she's had tough conversations with the president about this. ""I’ve got a lot of constituents, a lot of people that are neighbors and friends who are hurting, who have lost family, are scared for their family who have no food, no health care, no water. This is an issue that he’s got to talk about with people head-on. Donald Trump doesn’t offer any solutions, either,"" Dingell said in an interview with Fox News Monday. Some Democrats, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who also serves as co-chair for Biden's reelection campaign, have urged members of her party to keep up their support for the president instead of inadvertently helping former President Donald Trump, who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. El-Sayed pushed back on criticism that it will benefit Trump, emphasizing the protest vote's focus is on the Democratic primary, not necessarily the general election. ""While it’s clear that Biden will win the primary, it’s critical for him and his team to understand that votes in November have to be EARNED. And by voting uncommitted, I have the opportunity to count myself among the votes he’s putting in jeopardy in November,"" El-Sayed said in his post.

Biden's harshest public remarks about Israel came earlier this month when he called its conduct in the Gaza Strip ""over the top."" In private, Biden reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “pain in my a**."" The U.S., along with Qatar and Egypt, have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel on a potential deal for the release of hostages in exchange for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the president has not joined calls by other world leaders in calling for a permanent ceasefire.

,,How Arab American voters' backlash could imperil Biden's 2024 campaign,"Women pray at Dar Al Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Va., on Oct. 31. Photo: Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images Arab American and Muslim American anger over President Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war could be endangering his re-election in the majority of 2024 swing states. Driving the news: Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, Arizona and Pennsylvania all have notable pockets of these populations. There aren't reliable statistics on how many are registered voters — but even tiny shifts of support in any of these super-tight states that Biden won in 2020 could make a difference. Why it matters: It's another case of Biden facing possible defections from heavily Democratic groups that in 2020 helped him take down former President Trump, Biden's likely opponent again next year. Zoom in: An Axios review of 2020 results in these crucial states shows that if even a sliver of the Arab American and Muslim American vote were to stay home or defect to Republicans, Biden could be in a deep hole. The intrigue: The Arab American Institute believes those state population figures are low, noting that the U.S. Census doesn't have a category for Arab Americans on its forms. Zoom out: Since Israel responded to Hamas' deadly attack on Oct. 7 with bombings that have killed thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, Arab Americans have criticized Biden for his strong support of Israel. Many say he hasn't shown enough sensitivity to the deaths of innocent Palestinians. What they're saying: ""It has been numbing to us. I feel very depressed,"" Samia Assed, a Palestinian American peace activist in Albuquerque, tells Axios. State of play: The angst comes even after the Biden administration released a plan to combat Islamophobia before Hamas' attack last month, and after Biden appointed several Arab Americans to his staff. Yes, but: Those outreach efforts haven't stopped the public anger from Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, at least for now. Flashback: Arab Americans and Muslim Americans showed their political muscle during Trump's presidency when he instituted the Muslim ban. What's next: It's unclear if the war in the Middle East will be a defining issue in the 2024 election, which is nearly a year away. But many Arab Americans say it will remain fresh on their minds.

Disappointed Democrats drove Wednesday toward extending their control of the House for two more years but with a potentially shrunken majority as they lost at least seven incumbents and failed to oust any Republican lawmakers in initial returns. Democrats’ hopes of protecting their majority and even expanding it were based on public anxiety over the pandemic, Trump’s alienation of suburban voters and a vast fundraising edge. But those advantages didn't carry them as far as they'd hoped. Read more here. Biden campaign says Biden on track to win Democratic candidate Joe Biden's campaign said on Wednesday the former U.S. vice president was on track to win the 2020 election against President Donald Trump, with expected victories in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Campaign manager Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said she expected Biden will have more than 270 electoral votes later on Wednesday. She told reporters she believed Biden has already won Wisconsin and was expected to win Nevada. Biden team: Trump faces 'embarrassing defeat' if he fights vote in Supreme Court President Donald Trump will suffer a harsh loss if he follows through on threats to challenge election vote counts in the US Supreme Court, a lawyer for Democrat Joe Biden's campaign warned Wednesday. Trump ""will be in for one of the most embarrassing defeats a president ever suffered before the highest court in the land"" if he asks it to invalidate ballots counted after Election Day, said former White House counsel Bob Bauer. Trump holds lead in North Carolina With 100% of precincts now reporting, Trump is still leading Biden in the Tar Heel State. But Trump’s margin -- about 78,000 votes -- is less than the number of outstanding absentee ballots yet to be counted, about 117,000, leaving the race too close to call. Both candidates made frequent visits to North Carolina, which Barack Obama narrowly won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Trump won the state by 3.6 percentage points in 2016. -- Andrew Ballard Biden leading by 2.3 million in popular vote Biden was leading the national popular vote by more than 2.3 million votes as of Wednesday morning. He had 69.6 million votes to 67.3 million for Trump in partial results. This is hardly alarming for Trump, since U.S. presidencies are won with electors rather than vote totals. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by almost 2.9 million votes to Democrat Hillary Clinton, who scored huge margins of victory in the populous blue states of California, New York and Illinois, where Trump had done little campaigning. The loser of the popular vote (George W. Bush) also won the presidency in 2000. Before that it had happened only three times, in 1824, 1876 and 1888. -- Laurence Arnold Trump’s road to Supreme Court is neither fast nor certain President Donald Trump said he will go to the U.S. Supreme Court because he wants “all voting to stop,"" as he tries to hold on to early leads in key battleground states. He won’t be able to go there immediately and it’s not clear he has a legal argument that could affect the outcome of the election. Cases typically work their way to the nation’s highest court after a ruling by a local judge and then other appeals courts. In 2000, it took more than a month before the Supreme Court issued the landmark Bush v. Gore ruling that ultimately decided that year’s election. The Supreme Court has only limited power to sway the outcome of the election. Trump would need to raise specific legal objections -- under either the Constitution or a federal statute -- that could swing a pivotal state. Rupee plunges to 2-month low over US election uncertainty The Indian rupee on Wednesday plunged by 35 paise to close at its weakest level in over 10 weeks at 74.76 against the US dollar as investors appeared cautious looking for clarity on the US election outcome and the latest tranche of fiscal stimulus. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 74.74 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 74.57 and a low of 74.90. It finally settled at 74.76 -- its lowest level since August 21 this year. 9 states have not been called yet Trump and Biden's fate now hangs on these states: Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Maine, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Close contests in five key states mean the U.S. presidential election may not be decided for days, or longer, even as President Donald Trump’s falsely claimed victory over Democrat Joe Biden with millions of ballots still to be counted. As of 6 a.m. New York time Wednesday, Biden had 238 electoral votes while Trump had 213, leaving both shy of the 270 needed to secure immediate victories. Biden’s Nevada lead shrinks in close race Biden’s lead over Trump in Nevada, a state Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016, has narrowed to less than 8,000 votes, or 0.64 percentage points, according to the latest batch of returns. While Nevada is done counting for the evening, the race is not over there yet: Tens of thousands of mail-in and provisional ballots from same-day registration have yet to be counted, including in urban parts of Clark County, where those votes may favor Democrats. Nevada allows mail-in ballots that are postmarked by Election Day to be counted until Nov. 10. The latest numbers reflect all votes cast in person on Tuesday and in weeks of early voting, as well as all mail ballots received through Monday. The next update will be at 9 am on Thursday, according to the Secretary of State. Clinton won the state by a margin of 2.42 percentage points four years ago Biden edges ahead in Wisconsin as vote count continues In Wisconsin, Biden took a small lead around 4:30 am New York time, as several metropolitan areas submitted their absentee ballot counts. As expected, the Democrat took a large haul from Milwaukee, the state’s biggest city -- crucial to potentially overcoming Trump’s strength in smaller towns and rural areas. An influx of nearly 170,000 absentee votes from the city of Milwaukee erased the solid lead from in-person voting that Trump had maintained since the polls closed at 8 pm. The president, who carried Wisconsin by 0.8 percentage points in 2016, trailed Biden in by 0.3 percentage points in the latest figures with some precincts still outstanding. Biden camp: Trump bid to stop vote counting 'outrageous' Joe Biden's White House campaign slammed President Donald Trump's threat to try to stop the election vote count as ""outrageous"" early Wednesday, saying its legal team was ready to prevent such an ""unprecedented"" act. ""The president's statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect,"" Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement as the election remained undecided. ""Never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election."" The comments came shortly after Trump delivered an extraordinary speech from the White House, in which he claimed that ""we did win this election"" despite neither candidate reaching the electoral vote threshold for victory. Key states unsettled as counting enters Day 2 The US presidential election remained unsettled Wednesday morning as key states continued counting ballots. After a relatively untroubled day at US polling places, unprecedented numbers of early and mail-in votes complicated counts across the country. By early Wednesday morning, both President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden retained potential paths to victory. Ballot-counting continues in key battleground states, including Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, as the presidency and control of the US Senate remain up for grabs on the morning after the US election. Shortly before 3 am New York time, Biden won Arizona, marking the Democratic nominee’s first victory in a state Trump won in 2016. He also picked up what could be a crucial single elector in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District. But with his own victories in Texas and Florida, Trump had a viable path to victory as well – setting up high stakes in what could become a drawn out resolution in the remaining states. Pennsylvania sees 1 million votes yet uncounted Pennsylvania has more than 1 million votes left to count, its Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, said in a Twitter posting early Wednesday. “I promised Pennsylvanians that we would count every vote and that’s what we’re going to do,"" Wolf said on Twitter. His tweet came after Trump falsely declared victory and complained of “a fraud on the American public"" in ongoing vote-counting. “Let’s be clear: This is a partisan attack on Pennsylvania’s elections, our votes, and democracy,"" Wolf said in another Twitter post. -- John Voskuhl Biden campaign willing to fight Trump in court Democrat Joe Biden's campaign says it will fight any efforts by President Donald Trump's campaign to go to the US Supreme Court to prevent ballots from being tabulated. Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon called Trump's statement that he will “be going to the US Supreme Court"" and that he wants “all voting to stop"" “outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect."" O'Malley Dillon says the Biden campaign has “legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort."" And she says, “They will prevail."" First flip: Biden takes Arizona from Trump Joe Biden won Arizona, a state Trump won in 2016. It is the first state to flip in the election and greatly complicates the president’s path to re-election. Biden also won three of Maine’s four Electoral College votes, the AP said.

US set to witness highest voter turnout in a century The US appears to be on track to see over 160 million votes cast in the 2020 presidential election, a turnout rate of about 67 per cent, which is higher than the country has witnessed in more than a century, as President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden campaigned through the final day to get more voters to the polling booths.

Biden briefly appears to confuse granddaughter with son in verbal gaffe Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden briefly appeared to confuse his granddaughter with his son as he spoke in Philadelphia on Election Day, in a verbal gaffe which was swiftly seized on by the Trump campaign. Biden, a former stutterer renowned for becoming easily tangled in his words, was introducing the daughter of his son Beau -- who died of brain cancer in 2015 -- to supporters in the city in Pennsylvania when he called her ""none other than my son Beau Biden."" U.S. Election Day unfolds smoothly, so far defying fears of disruption Americans by the millions patiently lined up on Tuesday to cast ballots at libraries, schools and arenas amid a deadly pandemic, in an orderly show of civic duty that belied deep tensions shaping one of the most polarizing presidential campaigns in U.S. history. The face masks worn by many voters and the sight of boarded-up stores in some city centers were reminders of two big issues defining the 2020 election, with COVID-19 still ravaging parts of the country after a summer of sometimes violence-marred protests against police brutality and racism. Votes in SC county can't be counted immediately More than 13,000 votes in one South Carolina county will have to wait a while to be counted because of a printing error. Dorchester County Election Commissioner Todd Billman said at a news conference Tuesday that the mail-in ballots did not have the proper bars printed at the top so the scanner used to count the votes won’t register them. He says the error does not affect anyone's vote. Done with Trump, looking forward to elect Biden: Kamala Harris Kamala-Harris, US Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate on Tuesday, said that she is ""done talking"" about US President Donald Trump and expressed confidence in her party's presidential nominee, saying that she is looking forward to elect Joe Biden as the next president.

Door-to-Door Canvassing Strong in Nevada, Union Says Door-to-door canvassing by labor groups in Nevada, traditionally an Election Day strength for Democrats, faced a dual threat from the pandemic. It made some people wary of face-to-face interactions, and the economic crash it caused hit the state’s unionized hospitality workers particularly hard. But one powerful union says its operation was stronger this year, not weaker. Over the last several months, 500 canvassers from Nevada’s UNITE HERE Local 226, the Culinary Workers Union, have knocked on about 470,000 doors — at least 100,000 more than during the 2016 election, when 300 canvassers handled the load, according to Bethany Khan, the union’s director of communications. “And we have another nine hours left,"" Khan said Tuesday morning. Canvassers were also focused on signature curing, or helping voters correct mailed-in ballots that were filled out incorrectly. -- Sarah Holder and Laura Bliss Houston Area Turnout Tops 60% With Hours to Go Voter turnout in Harris County, Texas has surpassed 60% with almost six hours to go before polls close in the nation’s third-largest county. Since polls opened in Houston and its suburbs on Tuesday, 107,000 people have cast votes, pushing the cumulative total to 1.54 million, or 62% of those registered, according to the Harris County Clerk’s Office. In 2016, 63.5% of the county’s registered voters cast ballots, according to the Texas Secretary of State’s data. Elsewhere in Texas, election and public-health officials in places such as El Paso and Amarillo are dealing with resurgent Covid-19 outbreaks that are complicating voting procedures. In addition, El Paso police began erecting barricades are substations in anticipation of civil unrest, according to El Paso Matters, a nonprofit news website. --Rachel Adams-Heard North Carolina Extends Voting Times at Four Sites Results from North Carolina will come in 45 minutes later than planned. The State Board of Elections has extended voting times to as late as 8:15 p.m. at four sites – one in Cabarrus County, one in Guilford County and two in Sampson County -- after there were delays in opening them Tuesday morning. The board won’t release any voting results until all 2,663 polling places around the state have closed. About 4.6 million people, or 62% of the state’s registered voters, submitted ballots before Election Day. Those votes have been tabulated and will be released as soon as the last polling place closes. The state Board of Elections says it expects about 1 million people to vote in person today. Absent the handful of late poll openings, voting in North Carolina has gone relatively smoothly. “The extension of hours is not unusual in any election,"" said Karen Brinson Bell, the State Board of Elections’ executive director. -- Andrew Ballard FBI Investigating Robocalls Telling Voters to Stay Home The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into reports of misleading robocalls telling voters to stay home because of long lines at the polls, according to officials familiar with the situation. Residents of Flint, Michigan, have reported getting calls saying they should vote on Wednesday instead. Voters in Dearborn, Michigan, have said they received text messages with misleading information as well. The calls are a voter intimidation and suppression issue, the officials said. There have been some technical glitches in Ohio, Texas and Nevada, but local election officials have been able to resolve those problems quickly, the officials said. -- Alyza Sebenius Trump Predicts ‘Great Night’ to Campaign Staff President Donald Trump said he’s not yet considering either a victory or a concession speech during an afternoon visit to his campaign headquarters, but predicted “some tremendous results"" and a “great night"" for his re-election bid. “You never know,"" Trump said, while contending that toss-up states including Texas and Arizona were “looking really very strong."" “Winning is easy,"" he added. “Losing is never easy - not for me, it’s not."" The president said his voice was hoarse from a whirlwind push that saw him hold five campaign rallies Sunday, and he identified Florida and Pennsylvania as the most crucial states as voters cast their ballots. He said he believed his campaign had preformed well with seniors, Blacks, and Latinos, and credited his performance in the second debate -- along with his rally schedule -- for improving his standing in the polls. Trump also said it was possible Americans would know the results of the election Tuesday night, despite worry that the sizable early and mail-in vote due to the coronavirus pandemic could delay the reporting of results. “I think you’ll know possibly tonight depending on the extent of victory,"" he said. -- Justin Sink and Clare Roth Kamala Harris’s Husband Rallies Supporters in Ohio “We are a nation in pain,"" Douglas Emhoff, husband of Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris, told supporters at a noon rally in Columbus, Ohio. He also had a message for Trump. “Don’t mess with the mail, don’t mess with your vote and don’t talk about staying in office when you get voted out,"" Emhoff told a socially distanced crowd of about 50 gathered in the beer garden of Land Grant, a popular Columbus microbrewery. “People are sick and tired of it."" Emhoff, an attorney, is a partner at DLA Piper LLP. He and Harris were married in 2014. Trump has generally led in polling in Ohio, and the RealClearPolitics.com average shows him up 1.4%. The president’s winning margin in 2016 was eight points. In-person voting got off to a rough start in Columbus when Franklin County had to resort to paper voting logs. The county, home to Columbus, made the switch at 5:30 a.m. after election officials couldn’t determine that electronic poll books, used to make sure nobody votes more than once, were properly uploading, Franklin County Board of Elections spokesman Aaron Sellers said. -- Alex Ebert In Trump Coal Country, Economy Isn’t Only Worry Long lines snaked out of several voting places in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, about 40 miles east of Pittsburgh, one of the areas that delivered Trump victory in 2016 and could be critical to his winning (or losing) this year. Roughly two-thirds of Westmoreland voted for Trump in 2016, as did pretty much all of southwest Pennsylvania, save for Pittsburgh. For most of the 20th century the county was solidly for Democrats, fueled by a once-strong labor union machine of coal miners and coke processors. Westmoreland first voted for a Republican presidential ticket in 2000 and hasn’t changed course since. For some voters, the economy wasn’t top of mind. “The biggest thing for me is I have eight children, so I don’t kill babies,"" said Sonya Carren, 50, who chose to vote in person (for Trump) because she feared a ballot sent by mail would get lost. “I’m pro-life,"" she said. “I just can’t vote for anything or anyone who doesn’t support that."" Korey Thornton, 36, a barber from Greensburg, said his vote for Biden was a response to the “hate and bigotry"" he saw in the Trump administration. -- Brentin Mock Whitmer Warns Residents About Misleading Robocalls Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer tweeted about reports that residents in Flint are receiving robocalls spreading misinformation about voting. “We received reports that an unknown party is purposefully spreading misinformation via robocalls in Flint in an attempt to confuse voters,"" Whitmer said. “Let me be clear -- if you plan to vote in-person, you must do so, or be in line to do so, by 8PM today."" An unknown robocaller has placed calls to millions of Americans in recent weeks warning them to “stay safe and say home,"" according to the Washington Post. Whitmer said lines across the state are “minimal and moving quickly"" and that government officials will “work quickly to stamp out misinformation trying to prevent Michiganders from voting."" -- William Turton USPS Finds Ballot Delays in Battleground States The U.S. Postal Service reported delays in delivering ballots to election officials in three closely divided states that could swing the U.S. election: Michigan, where ballots must arrive today to be counted, and in parts of Pennsylvania and North Carolina. The cohort of ballots in transit remains large. In Pennsylvania, about 683,000 ballots had been requested by voters and not yet returned to election officials as of Nov. 2, and in Michigan the corresponding figure was about 476,000, according to the U.S. Elections Project that tracks early voting. In Pennsylvania and North Carolina, ballots can be accepted in coming days if they are postmarked by Election Day. Workers were sick from Covid-19 in Michigan and central Pennsylvania, the Postal Service said in an explanation of slow ballot delivery demanded by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington D.C. On Oct. 31 in both the Detroit and Philadelphia areas, about 78% of ballots sent by voters reached election authorities within the service’s guideline of 1-to-3 days for delivery, the service told Sullivan in a Nov. 2 filing. Other areas with on-time delivery less than 80% that date included central Pennsylvania and Greensboro, North Carolina, according to the USPS data filed with the court. Daily figures may not be reliable, and the service scores don’t include ballots that are handled locally without being shipped to large processing centers, which are delivered the same day with a near 100% success rate, the USPS said in the filing. It said “extraordinary measures"" are in place to deliver ballots. -- Todd Shields First Lady Casts Ballot, Sans Mask, in Florida First Lady Melania Trump visited a Palm Beach polling station Tuesday morning to cast her ballot in the way her husband has urged his supporters to: in person. She was the only person not wearing a mask at the polling center. She waved and smiled to reporters. When asked why she didn’t vote with the president last week, Trump said she’d wanted to vote on Election Day. -- Kathleen Hunter Biden Says Middle Class Built U.S., Not Wall Street Biden returned to his childhood hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday morning and made another appeal to working-class voters. Speaking to a group of canvassers, Biden said he wants to restore “basic decency and honor"" and unite a country he said has fractured under the Trump administration. “The middle class built this country. Wall Street didn’t build it,"" he said, speaking through a mask and using a bullhorn. Biden also explained that he calls Scranton, where he lived until he was in the fourth grade, home because it’s “where I learned all my basic values."" He said that “money does not determine your wealth,"" that it’s a basic responsibility to “look out for the other guy,"" and that “a job is about a lot more than a paycheck."" -- Elizabeth Wasserman Trump Says He’ll Declare ‘When There’s Victory’ Trump started his morning activities calling into the “Fox & Friends"" program and was asked about Democratic concerns that he may declare victory prematurely before mail-in votes are counted in key states. “At what point will you declare victory,"" one of the hosts, Steve Doocy, asked. “When there’s victory,"" Trump replied. “I think we’ll have victory. But only when there’s victory. I mean, there’s no reason to play games. I look at it as being a very solid chance of winning here."" -- Saleha Mohsin and Emma Kinery Biden Starts Day With Mass at Local Church The Democratic challenger started his day with an Election Day mass near his Delaware home. Joined by wife Jill Biden and two granddaughters, the visit to St. Joseph on the Brandywine was the first stop of a day that also includes a few final events in the key battleground of Pennsylvania. Biden’s son Beau, who passed away in 2015, is buried in the church’s cemetery. After leaving church, the Bidens walked to Beau’s gravesite. Biden is slated to travel to his childhood hometown of Scranton and then to Philadelphia before returning home to await election results. -- Jennifer Epstein Polls Open With Nearly 100 Million Votes Cast Polls are scheduled to open at 6 a.m. in seven U.S. states, the beginning of an Election Day that many expect to come and go without a declared winner because of millions of as-yet uncounted ballots that were cast in early voting. Heavy turnout is expected in many areas, even though by early Tuesday morning, about 99 million ballots – roughly 72% of the total in 2016 -- had already been cast as early votes or mail-in or absentee ballots. Voter surveys have been relatively lopsided in the handful of states that are opening polls earliest this morning: Trump has led convincingly in Indiana and Kentucky, while Biden has led in Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. Over the next hour, a number of states where the race is tighter are scheduled to open their polls – including North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. -- John Voskuhl Five Votes for Biden in New Hampshire Voting and the counting of ballots got underway just after midnight Tuesday in the tiny community of Dixville Notch in northern New Hampshire near the Canadian border. Biden received five votes to none for Trump. The entire proceeding, broadcast live by WMUR-TV, took just a few minutes. The results, while followed by political observers every four years, do not indicate, let alone foretell, anything about the election’s outcome. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received four votes in Dixville Notch, Trump two; Gary Johnson, an independent candidate, one.

,,Biden wants people to know most of the money he’s seeking for Ukraine would be spent in the US,"At a bustling construction site outside of Dallas, there are hopes that Congress can finally pass nearly $95 billion in foreign aid including funding for Ukraine — because factory jobs in the United States depend on that money. Aerospace and defense company General Dynamics’ new factory in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite is expected to initially employ 150 people to produce munitions. Set to open in June, construction is nearing completion, with newly planted trees and shrubs already in place at the complex overlooking one of the area’s busiest interstates. “We want to increase our wages and increase our skill levels and job opportunities,” said Kim Buttram, Mesquite’s director of economic development, who added that the factory is expected to have over 300 jobs when it’s at full production. As President Joe Biden pushes House Republicans to pass needed aid, he wants voters to understand that nearly two-thirds — or nearly $40 billion — of the money for Ukraine would actually go to U.S. factories spread out across the country including plants in Lima, Ohio and Scranton, Pennsylvania as well as Mesquite. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has refused to put the bill up for a vote on the House floor on the premise that it does not meet the needs of the American public. The supplemental spending measure contains a total of $95 billion in foreign aid, including money for Ukraine, Israel and other countries. Of the $60.7 billion for Ukraine, $38.8 billion would go to U.S. factories that make missiles, munitions and other gear, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the Biden administration. “While this bill sends military equipment to Ukraine,” Biden said Tuesday, “it spends the money right here in the United States of America in places like Arizona, where the Patriot missiles are built; and Alabama, where the Javelin missiles are built; and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, where artillery shells are made.” The president’s argument challenges criticism by some Republican lawmakers that the federal government should be spending more money at home instead of supporting overseas wars. In this case, most of the money goes to U.S. companies and workers, funding assembly lines to refill depleted stockpiles of weapons and gear that have already gone to Ukraine. The Democratic president is openly channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt and resurrecting the World War II-era concept that America is the “arsenal of democracy.” His sales pitch to the public is that his foreign policy is also about jobs for the U.S. middle class. But Biden is brushing up against opposition from former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner who ascended to the White House in 2016 on the promise of reviving U.S. manufacturing. Trump opposes the U.S. package to help Ukraine and has openly expressed a willingness to let Russia invade NATO allies who do not spend enough of their own budgets on defense. Many Republicans in Congress have taken their lead from Trump, with the party’s right flank increasingly questioning the value of U.S. interventions around the world and long-standing alliances built in the aftermath of World War II. Johnson has refused to bring the foreign aid bill up for a vote because it also lacks provisions to secure the U.S. southern border where immigrants are crossing illegally. But he previously rejected a bipartisan Senate bill that did provide funding to address immigration challenges, saying that the border measures would not solve the problem in the way that he wanted. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators,” Johnson said at a news conference last week. “It’s time for Washington to start showing some love to Americans.” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in contrast, has repeatedly implored his colleagues to understand that the funds from the package are for historic investments “right here in America.” “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy,” McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a floor speech during the long days of debate, “and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength.” The Mesquite factory sits in the congressional district of Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, who told Fox Business News in a December interview that he couldn’t tell his constituents that he voted for money for Ukraine without also getting money to secure the U.S. southern border. “I will never support any funding for Ukraine that does not include major measures of security at our own southern border,” said Gooden. His office did not respond to questions sent over email from The Associated Press for this story. U.S. factories shipped out nearly $162 billion worth of military goods last year, according to the Census Bureau. The shipments increased 8.1% compared to 2022. The supplemental funding could further drive factory production upward this year. But defense manufacturing can be volatile. Spending declined between 2010 and 2015. It then grew over the next four years, only to dip in 2021 and then climb again after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Biden administration has made an increase in the manufacturing capacity of defense contractors a priority, with a plan to increase the production of 155-millimeter artillery shells six-fold over three years. The supplemental bill stalled in the House would expand these efforts by making new investments in production lines for weapons and revitalizing the industrial base for submarine production, according to the White House. But on Friday, after news of the death of imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, Biden again pushed House Republicans to pass aid to Ukraine and take a stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin. But the House had gone into recess on Thursday afternoon. “It’s about time they step up — don’t you think? — instead of going on a two-week vacation,” Biden said. “What are they thinking?

,,2020 United States presidential election," Donald Trump
Republican Joe Biden
Democratic The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence.[9] The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[10] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[11] In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics, Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[d] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in presidential primary history, to runner-up Bill Weld's one delegate in the Republican primaries.[12] Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others; the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[13][14][15] Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail.[16] Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[17][18] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[19] Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since 1992, in Arizona since 1996, and in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2008.[20][21] Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[22][23][24][25][26] attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results,[27] falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states,[28][29][30][31] in what was described by many as an attempted coup d'état. Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[32][33] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[34][35][36] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[37] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing numerous lawsuits in several states (most of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[38][39][40] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[41] pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a phone call that later became widely publicized) and legislators to change results,[42] pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election ""corrupt"" and intervene,[43][44] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[45][46] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[47] With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to ""fight like hell"", a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count.[48][49][50] On January 7, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name.[51][52][53] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021; in a break from tradition, Trump did not attend his successor's inauguration.[54] Trump was indicted on August 1, 2023, on four counts relating to conspiring to overturn the results. Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[55] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals. The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various state and local-level elections.[56] The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.[57][58] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court[59][60] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020.[61] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election,[62][63] and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.[64] An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October 6.[65] The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine's electors (Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way).[66] While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first-choice votes statewide and in each district, use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third-party or independent candidates.[67] On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government.[68][69][70] The newly elected Congress, with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes, which began on January 6, 2021, was interrupted by the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and finished the following day.[71] The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the apportionment of House seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 United States census occurred, and the states conducted redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting, although some states have redistricting commissions. Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.[72] The party that won the 2020 presidential election could have also won a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts, which would stay in effect until 2032.[73]    Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 5, 2020, when he secured enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the national convention.[74] He was formally nominated at the convention on August 18.[75]   Every incumbent president seeking another term, with the partial exception of Lyndon Johnson in 1968,[76] has been renominated by their party since 1884.[77] Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, were able to easily secure the nomination after receiving enough delegates in the 2020 Republican presidential primaries.[78][79] Jo Jorgensen, who was the running mate of author Harry Browne in 1996, received the Libertarian nomination at the national convention on May 23, 2020.[80] She achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[81] Howie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee of the Green Party on June 21, 2020, and was officially nominated by the party on July 11, 2020.[82][83] Hawkins secured ballot access in 29 states and the District of Columbia, representing 381 electoral votes, and write-in access in 16 more states, representing 130 electoral votes.[84][85][e] The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July 13–16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[88][89][90] but was delayed to August 17–20 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[91] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in-person format, with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site.[92] On August 5, the in-person portion of the convention was scaled down even further; major speeches, including Biden's, were switched to a virtual format.[93] The 2020 Republican National Convention took place from August 24–27 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and various remote locations. Originally, a three-day convention was planned to be held in North Carolina, but due to North Carolina's insistence that the convention follow COVID-19 social distancing rules, the speeches and celebrations were moved to Jacksonville, Florida (official convention business was still contractually obligated to be conducted in Charlotte).[94][95] Due to the worsening situation with regards to COVID-19 in Florida, the plans there were cancelled, and the convention was moved back to Charlotte in a scaled-down capacity.[96] The 2020 Libertarian National Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Austin, Texas, over Memorial Day weekend from May 22 to 25,[97][98] but all reservations at the JW Marriott Downtown Austin for the convention were cancelled on April 26 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[99] The Libertarian National Committee eventually decided the party would hold two conventions, one online from May 22–24 to select the presidential and vice-presidential nominees and one at a physical convention in Orlando, Florida, from July 8–12 for other business.[100] The 2020 Green National Convention was originally to be held in Detroit, Michigan, from July 9 to 12.[90] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention was instead held online, without a change in date.[101] The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts on December 18, 2019.[102] The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,[103] and ended on February 5, resulting in acquittal by the United States Senate.[104] This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[105][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[107][108] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[109] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[110][111] Several events related to the 2020 presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and its effects, such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.[112][113] On March 12, Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.[114] The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington, D.C.[115] Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,[116] Kentucky,[117] Louisiana,[118] Ohio,[119] and Maryland.[120] As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates had halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID-19 concerns. Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation, could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.[121][122][123] Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID-19-related issues, including long lines at polling places, greatly increased requests for absentee ballots, and technology issues.[124] Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic, the number of polling places was often greatly reduced. Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative, but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested.[125] The March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail-in voting. By May, Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud, a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations.[126][127] Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus, became a major campaign issue for both parties.[128][129] On April 6, the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers's request to move the state's spring elections to June. As a result, the elections, which included a presidential primary, went ahead on April 7 as planned.[130] At least seven new cases of COVID-19 were traced to this election. Voting-rights advocates expressed fear of similar chaos on a nationwide scale in November, recommending states move to expand vote-by-mail options.[131] On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[132] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a ""flop"", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[133] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[134] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[135] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[136] On October 2, 2020, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a positive test from his senior advisor, Hope Hicks, as part of the larger COVID-19 outbreak among White House personnel. Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine, which prevented Trump from further campaigning, notably at campaign rallies.[137][138][139] Later that day, the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever, where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment.[140][141] Trump's diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump; Biden tested negative.[142][143] Trump was discharged from the hospital on October 5.[144] Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID-19, an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump, due to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings.[145][146] Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies, which were a major part of his campaign. As a result of Trump contracting COVID-19, Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him.[147][148] On October 12, one week after his discharge from the hospital, Trump resumed in-person rallies.[144] Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies, sometimes two or three in a day. His rallies were criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing, and some polls suggested that voters saw him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees.[149][150] U.S. officials accused Russia, China, and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 United States elections.[151][152] On October 4, 2019, Microsoft announced that ""Phosphorus"", a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government, had attempted to compromise e-mail accounts belonging to journalists, U.S. government officials and the campaign of a U.S. presidential candidate.[153][154] The American Government owned Voice of America reported in April 2020 that ""Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called 'spear-phishing' attacks on American political targets ahead of the 2020 vote."" Chinese spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations and said he would ""hope the people of the U.S. not drag China into its electoral politics"".[155] On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected.[156][157] The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. On February 21, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed U.S. officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, ""I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.""[158] Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior.[159] In a February 2020 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support Trump's reelection campaign; Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat, and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, for allowing the briefing to go forward.[160][161] China and some government-linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump,[162] though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community.[161][163] On October 21, threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states. The emails warned, ""You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.""[164] Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails, using a spoofed return address, had been sent by Iran. He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data, possibly from publicly available information, and ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy."" A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation.[165] In his announcement, Ratcliffe said Iran's intent had been ""to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump"", raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump. It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe's prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage; he had added it on his own.[166] On November 18, 2021, the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information.[167] Throughout the election period, several Colombian lawmakers and the Colombian ambassador to the United States issued statements supporting the Donald Trump campaign, which has been viewed as potentially harmful to Colombia–United States relations.[168][169] On October 26, the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, requested that Colombian politicians abstain from getting involved in the elections.[170] The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee accepted a $100,000 donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.[171][172] Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of 2016's election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty-first century attacks, and in fact conducted what were characterized as preemptive counter-strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in large-scale coordination of hacking,[173] and some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities. Nonetheless, after his dismissal, in a December 2020 interview, Chris Krebs, the Trump administration's director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described monitoring Election Day from CISA's joint command center along with representatives from the military's United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment, and representatives of state and local governments, as well as his agency's analysis preceding and after that day, saying, ""It was quiet. There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on, before, or after November third.""[174] Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote-counting in some areas, Krebs also affirmed that, ""All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America.""[174] Acts of foreign interference included Russian state-directed application of computational propaganda approaches, more conventional state-sponsored Internet propaganda, smaller-scale disinformation efforts, ""information laundering"" and ""trading up the chain"" propaganda tactics employing some government officials, Trump affiliates, and US media outlets.[175] During the campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews, and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him.[176][177][178] In July 2020, Trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results, just as he did in the 2016 presidential election, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that ""I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.""[179][180][181][182] Trump repeatedly claimed that ""the only way"" he could lose would be if the election was ""rigged"" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[183][184] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud;[185][186][187] at one point, Trump said, ""We'll see what happens ... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.""[188] Trump's statements have been described as a threat ""to upend the constitutional order"".[189] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, who was appointed by Trump, testified under oath that the FBI has ""not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise"".[190] A number of congressional Republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power, but declined to criticize Trump for his comments.[191] On September 24, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.[192] Trump also stated he expected the Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute, reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[193] In April 2020, Biden suggested that Trump might try to delay the election, saying he ""is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held"".[194][195] On July 30, Trump tweeted that ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history"" and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person. Experts[who?] indicated that, for the election to be legally delayed, such a decision must be made by Congress.[196][197] And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice-presidential terms at January 20, a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment.[198][199] Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common, with 25% of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places.[201] An August 2020 state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 – more than double the number in 2016.[202] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots.[203] In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots, the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy, the newly installed United States Postmaster General, including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail,[204] which caused delays in delivering mail,[205] and dismantling and removing hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines from postal centers.[206] On August 18, after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes, DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election. He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail-sorting machines and collection boxes.[207] The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots.[208] Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting, he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election.[209] In August 2020, Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail.[210] The Trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in Pennsylvania in locations other than an election office, and also sought to ""block election officials from counting mail-in ballots if a voter forgets to put their mail-in ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot return-envelope"".[211] The Trump campaign and the Republican Party both failed to produce any evidence of vote-by-mail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so.[211] On Election Day, a judge ordered mail inspectors to search ""mail facilities in .... key battleground states"" for ballots.[212] The agency refused to comply with the order and nearly 7% of ballots in USPS facilities on Election Day were not processed in time.[213] The Federal Election Commission, which was created in 1974 to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections, has not functioned since July 2020 due to vacancies in membership. In the absence of a quorum, the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions.[214] As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency's enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action.[215] As of September 1, 2020, Trump had not nominated anyone to fill the FEC vacancies.[216] On September 18, 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately said the precedent he had set regarding the Merrick Garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible, setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign.[217] The death of Justice Ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the Democrats and Republicans.[218][219] The president,[220] vice president,[221] and several Republican members of Congress said a full Supreme Court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election.[222][223] On September 26, the day after Justice Ginsburg's body lay in state at the Capitol, Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate, Amy Coney Barrett.[224] After four days of confirmation hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October 22,[225] and on October 26, Barrett was confirmed on a party-line vote of 52–48, with no Democrats voting for her confirmation.[226] This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election, and the first Supreme Court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party.[226] It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U.S. history.[227][228] On October 11, 2019, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of 2020.[234] The first, moderated by Chris Wallace, took place on September 29, and was co-hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.[235] The debate was originally to be hosted at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[235][236] Biden was generally held to have won the first debate,[237][238][239] with a significant minority of commentators deeming it a draw.[240][241] One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo-fascist group Proud Boys, instead responding that they should ""stand back and stand by"".[242][243][244] On the next day, Trump told reporters the group should ""stand down"" while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was.[245][246] The debate was described as ""chaotic and nearly incoherent"" because of Trump's repeated interruptions, causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates.[247] The vice presidential debate was held on October 7, 2020, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.[248] The debate was widely held to be subdued, with no clear victor.[249][250] One incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vice-president Pence's head, and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes.[251][252] The second debate was initially set to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the university withdrew in June 2020, over concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.[253] The planned debate was rescheduled for October 15 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami; due to Trump contracting COVID-19, the CPD announced on October 8 that the debate would be held virtually, in which the candidates would appear from separate locations. Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate, and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled.[254][255] The third scheduled debate took place on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was moderated by Kristen Welker.[256][257] The changes to the debate rules, which included the candidates' microphones being muted while the other was speaking,[258] resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate.[259] Welker's performance as moderator was praised, with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other.[260] Biden was generally held to have won the debate, though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree.[261][262][263] The Free & Equal Elections Foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates, one on October 8, 2020, in Denver, Colorado,[268] and another on October 24, 2020, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[269] The following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from September 2019 to November 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, had an average polling lead of 7.9 percentage points over incumbent President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden would win the national popular vote by 4.4 percentage points. Calculated averages are not comparable to those for the Biden vs. Trump polls. As polling with third parties has been very limited, the polls included in the average are often different. The following graph depicts the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in each swing state in the poll aggregators from March 2020 to the election, with the election results for comparison. OpenSecrets estimated the total cost of the 2020 election nearly $14 billion, making it the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle.[270] The COVID-19 pandemic was a major issue of the campaign, with Trump's responses being heavily criticized. The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection, including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them, but has also encouraged their use at times.[271] During the campaign, Trump held many events across the country, including in COVID-19 hotspots, where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing; at the same time, he mocked those who wore face masks.[272][273][274] Biden advocated for the expansion of federal funding, including funding under the Defense Production Act for testing, personal protective equipment, and research.[275] Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act to control the distribution of masks and ventilators,[276] but his response plan relied significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of 2020.[275] At the second presidential debate, Trump claimed Biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited China, but Biden responded that he had not been referring to this decision.[277] Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency's first three years, with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fifty-year low. Additionally, he has touted the 2020 third-quarter rebound, in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of 33.1%, as evidence of the success of his economic policies.[278] Biden responded to Trump's claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump's presidency was inherited from the Obama administration, and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic, including the need for 42 million Americans to file for unemployment.[279] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered income taxes for many Americans and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, were a major component of Trump's economic policy. Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class. Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 per year, while keeping the reduced taxes on lower-income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of 39.6%. In response, Trump said Biden's plans would destroy retirement accounts and the stock market.[280] Trump and Biden's views on environmental policy differ significantly. Trump stated that climate change is a hoax, although he also called it a serious subject.[281] Trump condemned the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process. Biden planned to rejoin it and announced a $2 trillion plan to combat climate change. Biden had not fully accepted the Green New Deal. Biden did not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land. In a debate, Trump claimed Biden wanted to ban it altogether. Trump's other environmental policies included the removal of methane emission standards, and an expansion of mining.[282] Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign. While Biden, as well as other candidates, promised protection of the Affordable Care Act, progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with Medicare for All. Biden's plan involves adding a public option to the American healthcare system,[283] and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care, which was removed from the Affordable Care Act by the 2017 tax cut bill,[284] as well as restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. Trump announced plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, calling it ""too expensive"", but he did not say what would replace it.[285] At the time of the election, the Trump administration and Republican officials from 18 states had a lawsuit before the Supreme Court, asking the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[286] As a result of the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality against African Americans, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid-2020. This was followed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which protested police brutality against black people, and became a central point of the 2020 presidential campaign.[287] Protests were mostly peaceful; fewer than 4% involved property damage or violence (with most of the latter directed at BLM protesters themselves).[288] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism, and looting caused about $1–2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[289][290] In response, Trump and the Republicans suggested sending in the military to counter the protests, which was criticized, especially by Democrats, as heavy-handed and potentially illegal.[291] Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters confronting diners in a restaurant as ""thugs"",[292] and called a street painting of the slogan a ""symbol of hate"".[293] Particularly controversial was a photo-op Trump took in front of St. John's Church in Washington, D.C., before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area.[284] Biden condemned Trump for his actions against protestors; he described George Floyd's words ""I can't breathe"" as a ""wake-up call for our nation"". He also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president, and establish a uniform use of force standard, as well as other police reform measures.[294] More than 158 million votes were cast in the election.[309] More than 100 million of them were cast before Election Day by early voting or mail ballot, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[310] The election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since 1900,[311] with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008.[312] The Biden–Harris ticket received more than 81 million votes, the most votes ever in a U.S. presidential election.[10][11] It was also the ninth consecutive presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not receive a popular vote majority by a double-digit margin over the losing major party nominee(s), continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U.S. history, which began in 1988 and in 2016 eclipsed the previous longest sequence, that from 1876 through 1900.[313][note 1][314] In 2020, 58 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties,[315] a decline from 61 percent in 2016.[316] Trump became the eleventh incumbent in the country's history, and the first since 1992, to lose a bid for a second term. Biden's 51.3% of the popular vote was the highest for a challenger to an incumbent president since 1932.[317][318][319][m] Biden is the sixth vice president to become president without succeeding to the office on the death or resignation of a previous president.[320] Additionally, Trump's loss marked the third time an elected president lost the popular vote twice, the first being John Quincy Adams in the 1820s and Benjamin Harrison in the 1880s and 1890s.[321] This was the first time since 1980, and the first for Republicans since 1892 that a party was voted out after a single four-year term. This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re-election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than he did in the previous election, after 1828. It is also the third election in which the two candidates that received electoral votes carried the same number of states. This also happened in 1880 and 1848. Biden won 25 states, the District of Columbia, and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump won 25 states and one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. This result was exactly the reverse of Trump's victory, 306 to 232, in 2016 (excluding faithless electors).[322] Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since 1992 and in Arizona since 1996,[20] and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since 1992 and Ohio since 1960, casting doubt on Ohio's continued status as a bellwether state.[323] Biden carried five states won by Trump in 2016: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also became the first Democrat since 2008 to carry Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, winning one electoral vote from the state. Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in 2016. Biden's three gains in the Rust Belt—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall, a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from 1992 to 2012, broken by Trump in 2016 when he flipped those three Rust Belt states.[324][325][326][327] Nevertheless, amidst Trump's national and electoral defeat, his scoring decisive victories in Ohio, Iowa, and Florida for the second time, after their having backed Obama twice, has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states.[328][329] In light of the attempts to contest the election results, an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome. If Biden's three narrowest state victories—Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point—had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[330][331] causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally. A similar situation occurred in 2016, when a shift of 0.77% or less in each of the three most closely contested states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), or about 77,000 votes, would have resulted in the popular-vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College.[332] Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties. This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban–rural divide.[333] While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[334] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[334] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[334] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[334] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[335] Biden became the oldest president ever elected, besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984, and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016. Major news organizations project a state for a candidate when there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning the state. Election projections are made by decision teams of political scientists and data scientists.[19] On the morning of November 7 at approximately 11:30 a.m. EST, roughly three and a half days after polls had closed, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, the Associated Press, CNN, and Fox News all called the election for Biden, based on projections of votes in Pennsylvania showing him leading outside of the recount threshold (0.5% in that state).[336][337][338][339][340][341] That evening, Biden and Harris gave victory speeches in Wilmington, Delaware.[342] On the invitation of the U.S. State Department, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which has been monitoring U.S. elections since 2002 (as it does for major elections in all other OSCE member countries), sent 102 observers from 39 countries.[343][344][345] The task force consisted of long-term observers from the ODIHR office (led by former Polish diplomat Urszula Gacek) deployed to 28 states from September on and covering 15 states on election day, and a group of European lawmakers acting as short-term observers (led by German parliamentarian Michael Georg Link), reporting from Maryland, Virginia, California, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and D.C.[343][345] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was scaled down to a ""limited election observation mission"" from the originally planned 100 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers.[343] An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors ""expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President's repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process, and postal vote in particular.""[343][346] On the day after the election, the task force published preliminary findings,[344] with part of the summary stating: The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.[347] Link said that ""on the election day itself, we couldn't see any violations"" at the polling places visited by the observers.[344] The task force also found ""nothing untoward"" while observing the handling of mail-in ballots at post offices, with Gacek being quoted as saying: ""We feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground. The system has held up well.""[345] The OSCE's election monitoring branch published a more comprehensive report in early 2021.[345][348] Candidates are listed individually below if they received more than 0.1% of the popular vote. Popular vote totals are from the Federal Election Commission report.[1] Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates by congressional districts. The winner of each congressional district gets one electoral vote for the district. The winner of the statewide vote gets two additional electoral votes.[354][355] States where the margin of victory was under 1% (37 electoral votes; all won by Biden): States where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (86 electoral votes; 42 won by Biden, 44 by Trump): States/districts where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (80 electoral votes; 17 won by Biden, 63 by Trump): Blue denotes states or congressional districts won by Democrat Joe Biden; red denotes those won by Republican Donald Trump. Counties with highest percentage of Democratic vote:[356] Counties with highest percentage of Republican vote: Voter demographic data for 2020 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by 15,590 voters in person as well as by phone.[358] The Brookings Institution released a report entitled ""Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win"" on November 12, 2020. In it, author William H. Frey attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college-educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older White without college degrees.[361] Frey says the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among White and older Americans.[361] Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 16%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since 1980. Democrats won the Latino vote by 32%, which is the smallest margin since 2004, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.[361] Biden reduced the Republican margin of white men without college educations from 48% to 42%, and the Democrats made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women. People age 18 to 29 registered a rise in Democratic support between 2016 and 2020, with the Democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19% to 24%.[361] Post-election analysis using verified voter data found the Associated Press's Votecast was more accurate than the exit polls.[362][363] Biden won 65% of the Latino vote according to Edison Research, and 63% according to the Associated Press. Voto Latino reported that the Latino vote was crucial to the Biden victory in Arizona. 40% of Latino voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016, and 73% of those Latino voters voted for Biden (438,000 voters).[364] Florida and Texas, which have large Latino populations, were carried by Trump. In Florida, Trump won a majority of Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Florida.[365] The Latino vote was still crucial to enable Biden to carry states such as Nevada.[366] Latino voters were targeted by a major Spanish-language disinformation campaign in the final weeks of the election, with various falsehoods and conspiracy theories being pushed out by WhatsApp and viral social media posts.[367][368][369] Demographic patterns emerged having to do with country of origin and candidate preference. Pre- and post-election surveys showed Biden winning Latinos of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican,[370] and Spanish heritage,[371] while Trump carried Latinos of Cuban heritage. Data from Florida showed Biden holding a narrow edge among South Americans.[372] Biden won 87% of the Black vote, while Trump won 12%.[373] Biden's advantage among Black voters was crucial in the large cities of Pennsylvania and Michigan; the increase in the Democratic vote in Milwaukee County of about 28,000 votes was more than the 20,000-vote lead Biden had in the state of Wisconsin. Almost half Biden's gains in Georgia came from the four largest counties – Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb – all in the Atlanta metro area with large Black populations.[374] Trump improved his overall share of the Black vote from 2016 by 4% and doubled the Black vote that Mitt Romney received in 2012.[375][376][373] Polls showed that 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) voters supported Biden/Harris, while 28% supported Trump/Pence. Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, said Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump by about a 2:1 margin. Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Indian Americans, and Chinese Americans favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to Vietnamese Americans and Filipino Americans.[377] Many voters were turned off by Trump's language some of which was widely considered racist such as (""China virus"" and ""kung flu"") but, according to Vox reporter Terry Nguyen, many Vietnamese voters (and especially elderly, South Vietnamese migrants who populated coastal centers in the 1970s) appreciated his strong anti-China stance.[378] Data from FiveThirtyEight indicated 65% of Indian American voters backed Joe Biden, and 28% supported Donald Trump.[377] Some Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[379] In a speech given to 50,000 Indian-Americans during his 2019 visit to the US, Modi praised Trump with remarks that were interpreted as an indirect endorsement of his candidacy.[380] Indian right-wing organizations like the Hindu Sena had performed special havans and pujas for Trump's electoral victory.[381] Pre-election voter surveys by Indian Country Today found 68% of American Indian and Alaska Native voters supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[382] In particular, the Navajo Reservation, which spans a large quadrant of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, delivered up to 97% of their votes per precinct to Biden,[383] while overall support for Biden was between 60 and 90% on the Reservation.[384] Biden also posted large turnout among Havasupai, Hopi, and Tohono O'odham peoples,[385] delivering a large win in New Mexico and flipping Arizona. In Montana, while the state went for Trump overall, Biden won counties overlapping reservations of the Blackfeet, Fort Belknap, Crow and Northern Cheyenne.[386] The same pattern held in South Dakota, with most of the counties overlapping the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes going for Biden. For example, in Oglala Lakota County, which overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Biden won 88% of the vote.[386] Trump's strongest performance among Native tribes was with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, where he won a strong majority in Robeson County and flipped Scotland County from Democratic to Republican.[387] Trump had campaigned in Lumberton, in Robeson County, and had promised the Lumbees federal recognition.[387] Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls overestimated him by three to four points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than 2016's error (one or two points).[388] The numbers represented the highest level of error since the 1980 presidential election.[389] This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls,[390] as well as the House elections, where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted. Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states, including Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states. The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans.[388] According to The New York Times, polling misses have been attributed to, among other issues, reduced average response to polling; the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters; and pandemic-related problems, such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID-19.[388] According to CNN, research presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research indicated one of the primary problems was an inability by pollsters to include a certain segment of Trump supporters, either due to inaccessibility or lack of participation.[389] New Statesman data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately, leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group.[391] Election analyst Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote that the polling error was completely normal by historical standards and disputes the narrative that polls were wrong.[392] Election night, November 3, ended without a clear winner, as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted, including in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.[393] Results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mail-in ballots.[394] In a victory declared after midnight, Trump won the swing state of Florida by over three percentage points, an increase from his 1.2 percentage point margin in 2016, having seen significant gains in support among the Latino community in Miami-Dade County.[395] Shortly after 12:30 a.m. EST, Biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted, and said he believed he was ""on track to win this election"".[396][397] Shortly before 2:30 a.m. EST, Trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters, falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting, saying that continued counting was ""a fraud on the American people"" and ""we will be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.""[398][399] The Biden campaign denounced these attempts, claiming the Trump campaign was engaging in a ""naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens"".[400] In Pennsylvania, where the counting of mail-in ballots began on election night, Trump declared victory on November 4 with a lead of 675,000 votes, despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted. Trump also declared victory in North Carolina and Georgia, despite many ballots being uncounted.[401] At 11:20 p.m. EST on election night, Fox News projected Biden would win Arizona, with the Associated Press making the same call at 2:50 a.m. EST on November 4;[402][403] several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call.[404][405] By the evening of November 4, the Associated Press reported that Biden had secured 264 electoral votes by winning Michigan and Wisconsin, with Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada remaining uncalled.[406] Biden had a 1% lead in Nevada[407] and maintained a 2.3% lead in Arizona by November 5,[408] needing only to win Nevada and Arizona or to win Pennsylvania to obtain the necessary 270 electoral votes.[406] Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts[409] attributed this to several factors, including a ""red mirage"" of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.[410][411][412] On November 5, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote-counting in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote, but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the vote-counting room.[413] Also that day, a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign which alleged that in Georgia, late-arriving ballots were counted. The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[414] Meanwhile, a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign's lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[415] That judge also noted the official complaint did not state ""why"", ""when, where, or by whom"" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[416] On November 6, Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots, and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden.[417] Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November 6 that a recount would be held in Georgia. At that point, Georgia had not seen ""any widespread irregularities"" in this election, according to the voting system manager of the state, Gabriel Sterling.[418] Also, on November 6, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order requiring officials in Pennsylvania to segregate late-arriving ballots, amid a dispute as to whether the state's Supreme Court validly ordered a 3-day extension of the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive.[419] Several Republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court in subsequent days agreeing with the Pennsylvania Republican Party's view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline.[420] Protests against Trump's challenges to the election results occurred in Minneapolis, Portland, New York, and other cities. Police in Minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway. In Portland, the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police.[428] At the same time, groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix, Detroit, and Philadelphia, shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground.[428] In Arizona, where Biden's lead was shrinking as more results were reported, the pro-Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted, while in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump's lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported, they called for the count to be stopped.[429] Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent. Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked.[432][433] On November 9 and 10, The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state; all 45 of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud. Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic, the record turnout, and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots.[33] On November 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a statement calling the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history"" and noting ""[t]here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""[35] Five days later, Trump fired the director of CISA, whom he had appointed in 2018.[434] As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day, Trump falsely asserted that there was ""tremendous corruption and fraud going on"", adding: ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""[435] Trump has repeatedly claimed as suspicious that mail-in ballots showed significantly more support for Biden.[436] This blue shift phenomenon is believed to occur because more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail, and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states. Leading up to the 2020 election, the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual, as Trump's attacks on mail-in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots.[437] In early January 2021, Trump falsely proclaimed that he had by rights won all 50 states in the presidential election and a 535 to 3 electoral college victory. On January 2, during his phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, Trump said, ""As you know, every single state. We won every state; we won every statehouse in the country... But we won every single statehouse.""[438] Two days later, on January 4, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton, Georgia, supporting Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. During his speech at the rally, Trump again asserted that he won ""every single state"", and ""We win every state, and they're going to have this guy [Biden] be President?""[439] Many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading. In Fulton County, Georgia, the number of votes affected was 342, with no breakdown of which candidates they were for.[440] A viral video of a Pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting, while a video claiming to show a man taking ballots illegally to a Detroit counting center was found to show a photographer transporting his equipment.[441][442] Another video of a poll watcher being turned away in Philadelphia was found to be real, but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved.[443] A viral tweet claimed 14,000 votes in Wayne County, Michigan, were cast by dead people, but the list of names included was found to be incorrect.[444] The Trump campaign and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson also claimed a man named James Blalock had voted in Georgia despite having died in 2006, but in fact his 94-year-old widow had registered and voted as Mrs. James Blalock.[445] In Erie, Pennsylvania, a postal worker who claimed the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day later admitted he had fabricated the claim. Prior to this recantation, Republican senator Lindsey Graham cited the claim in a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation, and a GoFundMe page created for the postal worker ""patriot"" raised $136,000.[446] Days after Biden had been declared the winner, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted without evidence that the Democratic Party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting.[447] Republican former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated on Fox News, ""I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election.""[448] Appearing at a press conference outside a Philadelphia landscaping business as Biden was being declared the winner, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable.[449] Responding to Giuliani, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said: ""Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed, and repeating these false attacks is reckless. No active lawsuit even alleges, and no evidence presented so far has shown, widespread problems.""[33] One week after the election, Republican Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud, stating, ""I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread."" He added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in Philadelphia but ""not a single one of them voted in Philadelphia after they died."" Trump derided Schmidt, tweeting, ""He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption & dishonesty. We win!""[450] Attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges could not produce valid evidence to support the allegations. In one instance, a Trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in Detroit on the basis of a Republican poll watcher's claim that an unidentified person had said ballots were being backdated; Michigan Court of Appeals judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the argument as ""inadmissible hearsay within hearsay"".[451][452] Some senior attorneys at law firms working for Trump, notably Jones Day, expressed concerns that they were undermining the integrity of American elections by advancing arguments without evidence.[453] Trump and his lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly made the false claim that the Toronto, Ontario-based firm Dominion Voting Systems, which had supplied voting machines for 27 states, was a ""communist"" organization controlled by billionaire George Soros, former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez (who died in 2013), or the Chinese Communist Party, and that the machines had ""stolen"" hundreds of thousands of votes from Trump. Defamatory rumors about the company circulated on social media, amplified by more than a dozen tweets or retweets by Trump. The disinformation campaign prompted threats and harassment against Dominion employees.[456] A December 2020 poll showed 77% of Republicans believed widespread fraud occurred during the election, along with 35% of independent voters.[457] Overall, 60% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 34% did not, and 6% were unsure. Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result, with 62% of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, while 37% did not.[458] This split in popular opinion remained largely stable, with a January 10, 2021, poll commissioned by ABC News showing 68% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate and 32% did not.[459] These numbers remained largely stagnant, with a June 2021 poll from Monmouth showing 61% believed Biden won fair and square, 32% believed he won due to fraud, and 7% were unsure.[460] More than a year later, public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant, with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that 65% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 33% believed it was not legitimate, and 2% were unsure. The same poll also found that 72% of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were attacking democracy, while 25% thought they were protecting democracy, and 3% were unsure.[461] A March 2022 poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that 52% of voters think that it is likely that cheating ""affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election."" while 40% of voters believe that it is unlikely. 33% say that cheating was very likely, 19% say it was somewhat likely, 13% say it was somewhat unlikely, and 27% say it was very unlikely.[462] Motivated by the myth of widespread fraud, Republican state lawmakers initiated a push to make voting laws more restrictive.[463] After the election, the Trump campaign filed lawsuits in multiple states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.[464] Lawyers and other observers noted the suits were unlikely to affect the outcome. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt said, ""There's literally nothing that I've seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result.""[465] Some law firms moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election.[466] Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn Biden's win in Georgia through litigation; suits by the Trump campaign and allies were rejected by both the Georgia Supreme Court[467] and by federal courts.[468][469] Trump also sought to overturn Biden's win by pressuring Kemp to call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly so state legislators could override the Georgia election results and appoint a pro-Trump slate of electors, an entreaty rebuffed by Kemp.[470] On December 20, Giuliani filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to overturn the results of the Pennsylvania election and direct the state legislature to appoint electors. The Supreme Court was regarded as very unlikely to grant this petition, and in any case Biden would still have a majority of Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania.[471] The Court set the deadline for reply briefs from the respondents for January 22, 2021, two days after President Elect Biden's inauguration.[472] On December 9, Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, asking the court to overturn the results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Attorneys general of seventeen other states also signed onto the lawsuit.[473][474][475] 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives, more than two-thirds of the Republican caucus, signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.[476] The suit was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 11.[477][478] Early in the morning on November 4, with vote counts still going on in many states, Trump claimed he had won: ""This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election, frankly we did win this election.""[480] For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him, Trump refused to formally concede, breaking with the tradition of formal concession started in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President-elect William McKinley.[481] Biden described Trump's refusal as ""an embarrassment"".[482] In the wake of the election, Trump's White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way,[483] and the General Services Administration (GSA) refused to formally acknowledge Biden's victory,[484] Trump finally acknowledged Biden's victory in a tweet on November 15, although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud, stating: ""He won because the Election was Rigged."" Trump then tweeted: ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.""[485][486] In a June 2021 interview with Sean Hannity, Trump stated that ""we didn't win"" and said that he wished President Biden success in international diplomacy, which Forbes declared as Trump ""[coming] as close as he's ever been to conceding his 2020 election loss.""[487] Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November 7, the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Trump appointee Emily W. Murphy, refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president-elect. Without formal GSA ascertainment of the winner, the official transition process was delayed.[488] On November 23, Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the transition. Trump said he had instructed his administration to ""do what needs to be done"" but did not concede, and indicated he would continue his fight to overturn the election results.[489] Both before and after the election, Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican-controlled state legislatures to select presidential electors favoring Trump, even if Biden won the popular vote in those states.[490] In Pennsylvania, a state which Biden won, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider allowing the Republican-controlled state legislature to select electors.[491] Legal experts, including New York University law professor Richard Pildes, have raised numerous legal and political objections to this policy, noting that in various battleground states, Democratic Party members holding statewide office would thwart such efforts,[492] and ultimately Congress would probably reject the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those elected by the voters.[493] Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected, including the power to directly appoint them, Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed, which they have designated to be Election Day, meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date.[494] In modern times, most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state's electors,[492] and changing election rules after an election could also violate the Constitution's Due Process Clause.[495] In November, Trump focused his efforts on trying to delay vote certifications at the county and state level.[496] On December 2, Trump posted a 46-minute video to his social media in which he repeated his baseless claims that the election was ""rigged"" and fraudulent, and he called for either state legislatures or courts to overturn the election and allow him to stay in office.[497] He continued to pressure elected Republicans in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in an unprecedented attempt to overturn his loss. Some commentators have characterized Trump's actions as an attempted coup d'état or self-coup.[47] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who was previously said he would not recognize the election results, publicly accepted Biden's win, saying, ""Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.""[498] A December 18 meeting in the White House discussed Michael Flynn's suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision.[499][500][501] Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying: ""There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.""[502] In a December 20 tweet, Trump dismissed accusations that he wanted to declare martial law as ""fake news"".[503] In a December 21 news conference, outgoing attorney general William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump, including seizing voting machines, appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud, and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden.[504] As the Trump campaign's lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states, including state legislators, attorneys general, and governors who had supported him during and after the elections. He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes, throwing out certain votes, or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature.[505] In late November, he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan, urging them to reverse their vote certifications.[506] He invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House, where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors.[507] He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state, demanding that they reverse their state's election results, and retaliating when they did not, strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets, and demanding that the governor resign.[508] During the first week of December, Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives, urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors; the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state's representatives in Congress to dispute the results.[505] On January 4 The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January 2, Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's result, telling him ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate.[42][509] On January 4, 2021, Democratic congressional leaders, believing Trump ""engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes"", requested the FBI to investigate the incident.[510] In addition, while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump's Georgia call, Democrats began drafting a censure resolution.[511] Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had misquoted Trump, and added a correction to the article.[512] Also on January 2, 2021, Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly 300 state legislators from Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in which he urged them to ""decertify"" the election results in their states.[513] On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 13,558 votes.[514] The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,284 votes. Therefore, the results of the hand recount netted Trump 1,274 votes. The change in the count was due to a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally.[515][516] After certifying the results Republican governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots, despite the fact that this request was impossible,[468] as signatures on mail-in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices, and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.[517][518] The Trump campaign requested a machine recount, which was estimated to cost taxpayers $200,000 in one Georgia county alone.[519] On December 7, Biden was confirmed as the winner of the recount requested by Trump's campaign.[468] On November 18, the Trump campaign wired $3 million to pay for partial recounts in Milwaukee County and Dane County, Wisconsin, where Milwaukee and Madison, the two largest cities in the state and Democratic strongholds, are located.[520][521] During the recount, Milwaukee County election commissioner Tim Posnanski said several Republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents.[522] The recount started November 20 and concluded on November 29, increasing Biden's lead by 87 votes.[523] The presidential electors met in the state capitol of each state and in the District of Columbia on December 14, 2020, and formalized Biden's victory, casting 306 votes for Biden/Harris and 232 votes for Trump/Pence.[524][525] Unlike the 2016 election, there were no faithless electors.[526] In six swing states won by Biden, groups of self-appointed Republican ""alternate electors"" met on the same day to vote for Trump. These alternate slates were not signed by the governors of the states they claim to represent, did not have the backing of any state legislature, and have no legal status.[525][527] Even after the casting of the electoral votes and rejection of his lawsuits seeking to overturn the election by at least 86 judges,[525] Trump refused to concede defeat.[524][525][528] In a speech following the Electoral College vote, Biden praised the resiliency of U.S. democratic institutions and the high election turnout (calling it ""one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we've ever seen in our country"") and called for national unity. Biden also condemned Trump, and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome, for adopting a stance ""so extreme that we've never seen it before – a position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution"" and for exposing state election workers and officials to ""political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence"" that was ""simply unconscionable"".[529][528] The 117th United States Congress first convened on January 3, 2021, and was scheduled to count and certify the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. There were 222 Democrats and 212 Republicans in the House; there were 51 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and two independents in the Senate. Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states,[530][531] meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects, the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote.[532][533] A statement from the vice president's office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to ""raise objections and bring forward evidence"" challenging the election results.[534] On December 28, 2020, Representative Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in Texas challenging the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, claiming Vice President Pence has the power and ability to unilaterally decide which slates of electoral votes get counted.[535][536] The case was dismissed on January 1, 2021, for lack of both standing and jurisdiction.[537][538] The plaintiffs filed an appeal, and the appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the appeals court the next day.[539] As vice president, Pence was due to preside over the January 6, 2021, congressional session to count the electoral votes, which is normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election, demanding both in public and in private that Pence use his position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump and Pence the winners of the election.[540] Pence demurred that the law does not give him that power.[541] Starting in December, Trump called for his supporters to stage a massive protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 to argue against certification of the electoral vote, using tweets such as ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!""[542] D.C. police were concerned, and the National Guard was alerted because several rallies in December had turned violent.[543] On January 6, 2021, shortly after Trump continued to press false claims of election fraud at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, interrupting the Joint session of the United States Congress where the Electoral College ballots were being certified and forcing lawmakers to flee the chamber. As part of an organized effort by Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in close states, the House and the Senate were meeting separately to debate the results of Arizona's election and accepting the electoral college ballots submitted. Several other challenges were also planned. Congress reconvened that same night, after the Capitol was cleared of trespassers, and leaders of both parties, including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Speaker Mitch McConnell urged the legislators to confirm the electors. The Senate resumed its session at around 8:00 p.m. to finish debating the objection to the Arizona and Pennsylvania electors were also considered. The joint session completed its work shortly before 4:00 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[544][545][546][547][548][549][550] The rioters entered the House and Senate chambers and vandalized offices. Five people died as a result: one person was shot by police, one Capitol Police officer died from a stroke after fisticuffs with rioters,[551] one person died of a heart attack, another of a stroke, and the final death is still under investigation. Trump was accused of inciting the violence with his rhetoric,[552] an accusation reinforced with an article of impeachment on January 13 for ""incitement of insurrection"".[553] Several commentators viewed the attack on the Capitol Building as an indicator of political instability that could lead to political violence in future elections, ranging from domestic terrorism to a second American Civil War.[554][555][556][557][558][559] On January 11, 2021, Representative Cori Bush filed a resolution calling for the possible expulsion of more than 100 Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives who voted against certifying results of the presidential election, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the Senate Ethics Committee ""must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.""[560] On March 31, 2021, the Republican caucus of the Arizona State Senate hired several outside firms to examine the results of the presidential and senatorial elections in Maricopa County, where Biden had won by a large margin.[561] There had been three previous audits and recounts of that county's results.[562] The examination was initially funded by $150,000 from the State Senate operating budget; additional funding was to come from outside sources.[563] In July the lead firm conducting the review released a summary of major donors, indicating $5.7 million was raised from five groups associated with individuals who had cast doubt on the presidential election.[564] The audit began on April 22, 2021, and was expected to last 60 days.[565] The investigation was still ongoing in August when a judge issued an order for the release of documents.[566] On September 24, a preliminary release of the audit claimed to have found minor discrepancies in the original, state-certified count, which had actually widened Biden's margin by 360 votes.[567] On May 10, 2021, over 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals published an open letter alleging that there had been ""election irregularities"", suggesting that the election had not been ""fair and honest"" and did not ""accurately reflect the ""will of the people"", and arguing for tighter restrictions on voting.""[568] On May 12, 2021, U.S. Representative Liz Cheney was removed from her party leadership role as Chair of the House Republican Conference, partially for continuing to assert that the election had been fair and that the election results were final.[569][570][571] Well into Biden's presidency, Trump continues to insist that he had actually won the 2020 election.[572] As of August 2021, surveys found that a majority of Republicans believe it.[573] A widespread rumor predicted that Trump would be somehow reinstated to the presidency in August 2021, although the predicted date of August 13 passed without incident.[574] Legend[575] Total television viewers

,,"Biden battles Trump, lack of enthusiasm among Black voters","It is unclear if Black Americans will be energised to come to vote, potentially defining the outcome of the election. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Racial inequality in the United States came into sharp focus this year, and became a defining topic of the national debate, after police killings of Black Americans ignited months of widespread protests and galvanised the nation to demand racial justice and police reforms. The unrest has forced US President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election on a “law and order” platform, and his main challenger, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, to wrestle with the complicated issue of race in America, and try to appeal to Black voters. But with less than two months before the election, in the middle of a pandemic and record-high unemployment rates, whether Black Americans will be energised to come out in large numbers to vote remains uncertain – potentially defining the outcome of the 2020 election. A recent poll shows Biden by far outperforming Trump among Black voters, with 78 percent support. “Most Black voters are going to support Joe Biden,” said Ravi Perry, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science at Howard University, a historically Black university. “But there are differences in enthusiasm,” Perry tells Al Jazeera, “where Black women, for instance, have far more enthusiasm towards Biden, and many young people, support him but with far less enthusiasm.” Earlier this month, both candidates visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, a battleground state, and the site of the most recent turmoil following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who remains hospitalised after being shot in the back seven times by a white police officer while authorities were trying to arrest him in late August. Speaking at a local church in Kenosha after a private meeting with Blake and his family, Biden said the latest events would help Americans confront centuries of systemic racism. In contrast, Trump did not mention Blake by name, refused to acknowledge systemic racism and instead blasted the protesters and offered his unequivocal support to law enforcement. Data shows that Black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic Party since at least the 1960s, when the party passed civil rights legislation that outlawed racial segregation and prohibited racial discrimination in voting. But Black turnout, which rose in the 2008 and 2012 elections when the US elected and then re-elected the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, waned in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee. More profoundly, there is a growing level of cynicism among Black voters, pollsters have argued, particularly among young and male voters, and point to 2016 – when Clinton lost to Trump amid a six percentage points decline among Black voters – which proved critical in battleground states. Trump’s campaign this year has been trying to appeal to Black voters, particularly Black male voters and improve on his 2016 results, when 8 percent of Black people voted for him. According to a recent poll, 13 percent of Black voters said they plan to vote for Trump this election. Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury said, according to recent data he compiled, about half of Black voters believe the Democratic Party takes Black voters for granted and may choose to stay home or vote for Trump. “What we saw at the Republican National Convention was a very overt attempt to speak directly to the issues that are most important to Black men: criminal justice reform and unemployment,” Woodbury said. On the first night of the convention in August, the only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, relayed his personal success story, “Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,” he said. And Trump gave a full pardon to Jon Ponder, a Black convicted felon turned criminal justice activist. Several other Black speakers took the stage during the four-day event, including NFL players and a civil rights activist, and some touted Biden’s gaffe when he said that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” “The course of this election year will show that Black men are not a marginal part of his (Trump’s) strategy, but a path to victory,” Woodbury told Al Jazeera, “and he’s leaning into it.” And yet for many, voting Trump out of office, is a motivation on its own. Trump promoted the “birther movement”, alleging that Obama was not born in the US. He refused to condemn white supremacists and more recently, he allegedly called Black people “too stupid” to vote for him, according to his estranged former lawyer Michael Cohen. James Lance Taylor, a professor at the University of San Francisco, said many Black people will vote for Biden for no other reason than “to deal with the emergency of removing Donald Trump from office”. Many of the demonstrators who took to the streets after the police killing of George Floyd in May were making calls to “defund the police,” which would divert funds away from police departments and prisons in favour of investments in social services and re-examine what offences require a militarised response. Biden has said, “I don’t support defunding the police.” Instead, he has proposed a $300m investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities. According to a Gallup survey taken in July, 70 percent of Black Americans support or strongly support reducing police department budgets. But despite its popularity among Black Americans, strategists said if Biden backed the idea, he would run the risk of losing the support of moderate older white voters, a key demographic. “Defund the police may sound pretty good on Twitter, but to an awful lot of voters, including African Americans, it doesn’t make much sense,” Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist told Al Jazeera. “They want better policing, they want smarter policing, they don’t want the police defunded,” Manley said. Instead of embracing “defund the police,” Biden, who served as Obama’s Vice President for eight years, nodded to Black voters by choosing Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman to be nominated on a major party’s ticket. “Black folks noticed and were excited by it,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. “There is a segment of our community that thinks Kamala Harris’ record as district attorney and attorney general is shaky,” he said in reference to her years as a prosecutor when she embraced a “top cop” label. “But the overall feeling is definitely that is a step in the right direction, a sense that he recognises us.” The coronavirus pandemic, a disease which has killed more than 192,000 Americans and disproportionately affected Black communities, has added an additional layer of uncertainty regarding how many and who will be able to cast their vote in November. Most states said they will expand their mail-in voting systems amid health concerns about crowds and long lines. It remains unclear how turnout will be affected. But for most, Albright says, the desire to see Trump out of office, casts an urgency on the importance of voting this year that will outweigh all other considerations. “Even among people who are not enthusiastic about Biden, people are more clear, now we know better,” he said, “We see what a Trump presidency looks like and how it is impacting our lives and our health.” Follow Al Jazeera English: ",www.aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/12/biden-battles-trump-lack-of-enthusiasm-among-black-voters,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/israels-apartheid-must-end-south-africa-says-at-icj-hearing?traffic_source=Connatix
,,Trump vs. Biden: How COVID-19 Will Affect Voting for President,"JUNE 19, 2020 9 MIN READ Republicans’ and Democrats’ distinct responses to the pandemic could influence in-person and mail-in voting—and who wins BY GLORIA DICKIE Ira L. Black Getty Images (Trump); Mandel Ngan Getty Images (Biden) In late April Democrat Kweisi Mfume of Maryland won a special election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a landslide victory against his Republican rival. More remarkable than his win, which garnered three quarters of the vote, however, was that more than 110,000 Baltimoreans in the district cast their ballot by mail. Only 1,000 voted at one of three polling centers open there. In Georgia’s primaries in early June, more than one million voters used mail-in ballots, a huge increase over previous elections. In Wisconsin, voters are suing for greater access to such ballots because many polling places have closed in response to COVID-19—which has made it much harder to vote in person in the state’s primaries. These are just some of the political battles that have played out during the pandemic, when many people feel it is too risky to gather in public to do things such as vote in person. On June 2 eight states and Washington, D.C., held their primary elections, four of which had been postponed because of the disease. Half of the eight states had turnouts surpassing their 2016 levels—after taking extra efforts to ensure citizens received vote-by-mail ballots. But the others fell short despite such measures. Public health experts predict the coronavirus will still be a threat this fall. Americans can expect that some social distancing recommendations, such as staying six feet away from others and avoiding large gatherings, will remain during the November presidential election, in which Donald Trump will face off against Joe Biden. Political scientists say the ability to vote by mail, as well as attitudes about the danger of voting in person—which vary by party affiliation—could swing the contest. Election officials are implementing several fixes to allow people to vote safely, such as ramping up online registration and expanding mail-in voting. Rollouts of these measures across the U.S. have not been equal, however. And voting processes could differ from state to state come November. Some key swing states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, do not automatically send out vote-by-mail ballots but require people to apply for them. Another 16 states only allow mail-in voting for people with a particular reason, such as a disability. Republicans have long asserted that voting by mail favors Democratic contenders. (Trump has also claimed, falsely, that such voting encourages fraud. Evidence shows it does not.) But Democrats have countered that the opposition comes because mail-in ballots make it easier for minorities, immigrants and young people to vote, and those groups tend not to vote for Republicans. For example, North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature placed limits on early voting after it found that African-Americans were more likely to vote early and to vote for Democrats. Theoretically, states with a robust vote-by-mail system and enthusiasm for ousting Trump could expect to see a blue wave in November, says political scientist Rachel Bitecofer of Christopher Newport University and the Niskanen Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Bitecofer’s predictions for the 2018 midterm elections were largely correct. Other political scientists say that if states do not implement expansive systems for such voting, Democrats—who, according to recent polls, are more fearful of the virus—might stay home. And that scenario would favor Republicans on the ballot. The pandemic will likely dampen large political rallies and conventions this summer, putting candidates in a tough spot: they have to keep Americans safe, but they also need to rally voters and build enthusiasm for their campaign. Trump insists that his rallies and the Republican National Convention will proceed despite the pandemic—and has now moved part of the convention to Florida after opposition to a fully attended event in North Carolina, reportedly without social-distancing measures, came from the latter state’s governor. Biden, however, has largely moved his campaign online and plans for the Democratic National Convention to remain fluid. TIM KEANE JEFF TOLLEFSON & NATURE MAGAZINE LAUREN LEFFER AMY MAXMEN & KFF HEALTH NEWS “I expect both campaigns will structure their campaign events to fit into their overall narrative about how the county should be responding to the COVID-19 crisis,” says Marc Meredith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. “I also expect that the conflict between Trump and North Carolina’s governor over the [Republican convention] is a preview of the conflict that will repeatedly play out between the Trump campaign and state and local governmental officials—especially [in] Democratic states.” But Meredith says that campaigning’s impact on voter turnout is often overstated. A long-standing political science doctrine, called the minimal effects hypothesis, holds that presidential campaigns have a marginal effect on voting decisions. He does worry, however, that the pandemic will limit voter registration. Typically, volunteers with registration forms mill around political rallies, set up tables at college campuses or knock on doors in neighborhoods. Such in-person tactics will be very much reduced. “Door-to-door canvassing is one the most effective ways to mobilize nonvoters to become voters, as it generates social pressure,” Meredith says. A 2000 Yale University study found that personal canvassing substantially increased voter turnout. According to Bitecofer, such voter-registration efforts are key in deciding elections. Her model holds that turnout, not swing voters, ultimately determines who wins and who loses. With this situation in mind, campaigns will likely move to mobilize alternative techniques to target new voters by phone and online. Whichever camp can do so better could shift election results in its favor. Voting for president, unlike campaigning, cannot be done online. Mail-in ballots seem to be the obvious cure for an election plagued by a pandemic. Though studies of past elections indicate that voting by mail did not affect turnout to favor either Democrats or Republicans, 2020 is tilting that notion on its head. Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, says he used to be dubious of the claim that mail-in voting hurts Republicans. But after he conducted a recent survey on electoral processes and the coronavirus—results were released in a preliminary, non-peer-reviewed paper on April 30—Kousser amended his stance. “I think we are seeing evidence of an emerging trend in which a new partisan divide is opening up over voting by mail,” he says. When Kousser asked both Republicans and Democrats about their most preferred method of voting, in absence of any information on the coronavirus, a higher percentage of Democrats said they wanted to vote by mail. When he asked the same question accompanied by scientific projections about the spread of the coronavirus, the partisan gap doubled. “Democrats and independent voters were much more likely to say they wanted to vote by mail after being reminded of COVID-19,” Kousser says. “But the Republicans don’t seem to be influenced by the scientific projections. There is clearly polarization when it comes to whether people believe COVID-19 is a significant risk and want to change their behavior.” He stresses, however, that his survey looked at people’s most preferred voting method and did not suggest that Republicans absolutely would not vote by mail. Rather it showed that if given an array of options, more Democrats than Republicans would choose mail-in voting during the pandemic. Five states—Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Washington and Hawaii—have already established all-mail voting, in which every resident is mailed a ballot automatically. In another 29 states and Washington, D.C., residents must actively request a mail-in ballot from election officials but do not have to give a reason. The six swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all belong to this second group. The rest of the states have rules that only allow such voting if a citizen has a specific excuse, such as age, illness or disability. But several of them say they will allow more mail-in voting this year because of the pandemic.   These policies, particularly in the swing states, means a vote-by-mail partisan divide could significantly influence who becomes president. If less supportive Republicans don’t request a ballot in time or are unable to go to the polls in sufficient numbers, the Democratic candidate could claim victory in November. To underline this point: In one hard-fought primary race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, mail-in ballots favored a liberal candidate over a conservative one and suggested liberal Democrats voted by mail while conservative Republicans voted in person. A New York Times analysis found that the liberal-leaning candidate challenging for the seat generally performed at least 10 percentage points better than the conservative incumbent in such ballots. At one precinct in particular, the conservative justice garnered 64 percent of the Election Day vote, while the challenger took 70 percent of the votes cast by mail. Those mail-in ballots helped to carry the race for the liberal. Voting by mail may be especially important in November if the number of physical polling stations are reduced because of COVID-19. In the Wisconsin primary, only five of Milwaukee's typical 180 polling sites were open. Getting enough poll workers to sites may add to the trouble. More than half of poll workers in the last two general elections were age 61 or older, according to the Pew Research Center. And in the 2018 election 27 percent of such workers were older than 70. This group faces the greatest threat from the coronavirus and has been told all year to stay home to be safer. In both Wisconsin’s and Georgia’s recent primaries, fewer than usual workers showed up. The concern is reasonable: since the primary in Wisconsin, state health officials have identified 71 people who contracted the coronavirus from polling centers. To make mail-in voting work well for the November election, infrastructure will need to be ramped up in the 45 states that have not been automatically mailing ballots, says Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan research group that advises election officials. She adds that such efforts to bolster vote by mail need to start “immediately.” “There are a lot of parallels with the COVID-19 virus in terms of medical equipment,” McReynolds says. “If we’re not prepared, and in many ways the health care system wasn’t adequately prepared, then we’re scrambling to do it at the last minute. States need to evaluate what their needs are now and put those orders out.” States need to order things such as counting equipment (high-speed scanners that can process and count a huge influx of absentee ballots), new printers to produce mail-in ballots en masse and possibly ballot-sorting technology with signature verification, she says. Officials also need to ensure that Native-American voters on tribal lands, who may lack access to reliable mail service, can vote at sanitized, mobile polling units. Without the right equipment and procedures, there is already evidence from the primaries that states will run into trouble in November. In Indiana’s June 2 primary, state officials allowed residents to vote by mail. But some people who requested absentee ballots never received them. Election officials in Washington, D.C., also struggled to fulfill all the requests they received for mail-in ballots, forcing voters to wait in long lines at just 20 in-person polling stations that remained open. And in Pennsylvania, which passed legislation last year to move to a no-reason-needed mail-in approach, the system buckled under increased absentee-voting pressure. Thousands received the wrong ballot. And more than a week later, votes remained uncounted. Senate Democrats requested $2 billion in March for infrastructure to expand online voter registration, early voting and voting by mail. The amount was opposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. And in the end, the Senate passed a bill offering just $400 million for such expansion. A malfunctioning vote-by-mail system during the general election, when turnout will be much greater, could hurt Biden by making in-person voting more important. A preprint paper released in March found that Republicans were less likely to practice social distancing measures than Democrats, perhaps because of the same skepticism about projections of disease spread that Kousser found. “If Democrats are taking more precautions because of the coronavirus, we may see them not turn out as much as they would have without the pandemic,” says Shana Kushner Gadarian, the study’s co-author and a political scientist at Syracuse University. “That is pretty disturbing.” What the virus will actually do to November turnout for each candidate will not be known until after Election Day, of course. The early evidence from primary elections, combined with the results of national surveys, indicates that an expansion of voting by mail will favor Biden. Strong voter registration efforts by the Republican Party could still offset that advantage. And if states are unwilling or unable to bolster mail-in voting infrastructure—particularly in the six battleground states—and enough Biden supporters are too worried about the disease to vote in person while his opponent’s voters feel unhindered, the pandemic could pave the way for Trump’s reelection.

,,Will Biden campaign focus on saving democracy resonate in swing states? Here’s what Lehigh Valley voters say,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties         Daily e-Edition Evening e-Edition TRENDING:                                           Raymond Santiago, executive director of Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, sees the recent 38% rise in use of the organization's food pantry as a stark sign: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. (Chris Szagola/AP) BETHLEHEM — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling during lunch recently. Out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the last seven months, the number of visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign that many in the area’s Latino community are struggling. Northampton County, which includes most of Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the campaign coalition President Joe Biden is trying to rebuild. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination in 2024, is a danger to American democracy. Biden hopes the message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped his way after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. The threat messaging “won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge in Montgomery County, a place with deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, as the site of his initial campaign event for 2024, describing the upcoming race as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave in Philadelphia before the 2022 midterm elections. Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season this year. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging was resonating. They represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: Biden’s warning that a second Trump presidency will undermine democratic institutions is, by itself, not enough to motivate voters. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, said her opinion of Trump was already set before Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to halt certification of Biden’s victory. But she doesn’t feel that reminders of that day will be sufficient to engage voters in November. Her own priorities are immigration and federal spending abroad. Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad living in a more rural area of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He believes the warnings are overblown and notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’ ” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock. The bank executive from Nazareth said he also believes the threat concerns are overstated. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges,” he said. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages also will be essential elements of the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry nearly 30 years ago and is now enjoying a revival as a technology and health care hub. The county has long been a political bellwether. The last time its vote differed from the state’s in a presidential election was 1948, said Chris Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. Since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977, she has crossed party lines frequently — until 2016 when she voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time. The people Kodama encounters are more likely to respond to a positive messages. She would like Biden to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit this year to  Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. That strategy “resonates with me and with people I know,” said the artist and former teacher. For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message about Trump is not generating new concerns: “We already know who he is,” she said. Lee said in her circle the No. 1 issue is homelessness and its companion, affordable housing. At the Lehigh Hispanic center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the 27 years he worked at Bethlehem Steel. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric has made targets of Latinos and other minorities. But Lopez thinks messaging about Trump imperiling democracy actually “harms the vote.” The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,,Three Comforting Lies Democrats Need to Stop Telling Themselves About November,"President Joe Biden is in trouble in this November’s election. This does not mean he is guaranteed to lose, but defeat by a vengeful, unhinged Donald Trump and his radicalized Republican Party is a much more realistic possibility than many Democrats seem willing to accept. And if they are to rise out of the torpor of this dreadful situation, Democrats have to first stop telling each other comforting lies about what’s actually happening out there. I understand why it is so hard to believe—Trump is an absurd, repellent human being who is not only promising to install of soft dictatorship in the United States as his first order of business, but continues to accept zero accountability for the attempted putsch his team of Keystone Coupsters ran after the 2020 presidential election. He is threatening a military invasion of blue states and cities, egging on Texas neo-confederates on the verge of a shooting war with federal troops over the border, promising to lay off virtually the entire federal workforce and replace them with Turning Point USA interns, and facing 91 felony counts in four separate cases. He was recently found liable by a jury for sexual assault and then ordered to pay his victim more than $83 million. When speaking, he usually makes about as much sense as a refrigerator-magnet set assembled into sentences by a 2-year-old. But the fact that so many find the possibility of a Trump restoration to be utterly inexplicable, or even farcical, does not mean that it could not happen. And right now, there are too many high-profile voices in Democratic circles spinning yarns about how happy days will be here again soon and that Biden is in a fantastic position, actually. They are well-meaning (to use a phrase that got bandied about a lot last week by newly minted memory and aging specialist Robert Hur), but a lot of Democrats are telling each other these three comforting lies that aren’t ultimately going to help anyone. Late last month, New York Times columnist and podcaster Ezra Klein hosted veteran Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg to make the case for why Democrats should not be flipping out about the polls. Rosenberg’s very vocal and public position that 2022 wasn’t going to be a red-wave election has earned him near-mythical status in certain Democratic circles of the kind that was once enjoyed by former FiveThirtyEight data guru Nate Silver. “Democrats keep overperforming in elections,” Rosenberg said. He noted that Democrats did much better than expected in the midterms, as well as in the small number of significant races in 2023. He added that “when we actually go vote, we just keep winning, and they keep losing. And so I go into 2024 feeling really good about where we are.” And he was right about a few things. Particularly in some high-profile 2022 Senate and gubernatorial races, a handful of partisan-aligned pollsters were bending the averages on sites like RealClearPolitics and adding to an atmosphere of unnecessary panic among Democrats. Take, for example, the race for governor in Arizona, where RCP had Republican election-denier Kari Lake with a 3.5-point lead that was produced almost entirely by election-week polls from Republican firms Remington Research and Trafalgar. Lake lost to Democrat Katie Hobbs by under a point. That’s not actually a particularly huge miss, but it wasn’t an isolated case. In 2022, Rosenberg also insisted that Democrats had a real chance to hold the House of Representatives, which at the time was considered close to laughable in national circles. Democrats did end up losing the House, but they got the enduring narrative win. And on election night, as his prophecies came true one after another, he got upgraded from “I don’t know this guy but I hope against hope that he’s right” to Nostradamus. The problem for using the red wave that wasn’t as a template for 2024 is that Democrats outperformed narratives and expectations more than polls in 2022. There was very little in the available polling on election night 2022 that suggested Republicans were on the verge of a 2010-style midterm romp. In fact, the final generic ballot polling average on the much-maligned RealClearPolitics was that Republicans would win the national House vote by 2.5 points. They ended up winning it by 2.8. Polling as an industry and an art has taken a bludgeoning since 2016. And it is true that some individual state polling was improbably off in 2016 and 2020, largely but not exclusively in the Midwest. But everyone seems to have forgotten that the national polls in 2016 were close to as good as they’ve ever been, with Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 2.1 percent against a final RealClearPolitics average lead of 3.2 percent. Nationally, Trump beat expectations produced by forecaster certainty as much as he outperformed his actual polls. And in 2020, Trump ran ahead of his national polling average by a mere 3 points and once again came agonizingly close to victory in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin and Arizona. What is true is that the Dobbs backlash seems to have set the Republican electoral ceiling somewhat lower for the time being. In both 2022 and 2023 they lost races that should have been winnable for the opposition party with an unpopular president and an improving but still uneven economy. Republicans have also been getting dusted in special elections everywhere since Dobbs, including on Tuesday in the race to fill the expelled Republican George Santos’ House seat. But this underperformance appears to be already baked into head-to-head presidential polling, and the Republican electorate’s insistence on once again forwarding Donald Trump as their nominee is exacerbating the effect. That’s clear from the fairly substantial body of survey research that currently shows Trump edging out the president narrowly but Nikki Haley beating Biden decisively. But it is also the case that it might be Democrats who are now underperforming their expectations, if you believe the polling (which you should). With an incumbent president, very low unemployment and strong GDP growth, Biden ought to be on a glide path to reelection, especially with the incandescent fury about Dobbs powering Democrats elsewhere. But he’s not. And that brings us to the polls themselves, which the optimists are also telling you to ignore. The idea that polls are basically meaningless 10 months from a presidential election in which both candidates have close to 100 percent name recognition is one of those pieces of conventional wisdom that is as untraceable as a gun that has had its serial number scrubbed off. It was something that even Klein repeated in his interview with Rosenberg. On Wednesday, MSNBC columnist Michael A. Cohen called polling nine months from a presidential election “largely useless.” I genuinely have no idea why people keep saying this. In 2020, Biden led Trump by 5.6 points on Feb. 16, and bested him in November by 4.5. In 2016, Hillary Clinton led Donald Trump by 3.4 points, according to the RealClearPolitics average, in a race she ultimately won nationally by 2.1 percent. On this day in 2012, Barack Obama led Republican Mitt Romney by 5.7 points and put him away in November by 3.9 percent. The most comforting comparison for Democrats might be 2004, when John Kerry was ahead of incumbent Republican President George W. Bush by 1.9 points in an average of the last 10 polls through Feb. 16, and Bush came back to win by 2.4 percent. But that’s still only about a 4-point swing overall. The best you can say about this data, from a Biden Booster perspective, is that it always bounces around by a few points. But Biden, at the moment, likely needs more than a few points of recovery to win an Electoral College that still appears tilted against Democrats. And while there are plausible theories about why Biden’s polling might get better soon, and while it wouldn’t be especially surprising if it happened, there’s no particular reason to expect it to happen. On the contrary, all of the data that we have available to us suggests that the outcome of this November’s election will be within a few agonizing points of today’s averages: a 3-point Trump advantage in the Economist’s model, and a 1.1-point Trump lead in the RealClearPolitics average. The odds of this matchup being anything other than Biden–Trump, for better or worse, are pretty long at this point. These men are completely known quantities engaged in the first presidential rematch since 1956. Even someone who has been in a coma since late 2019 would have pretty firm opinions about them. But the Democratic optimists would have you believe that an electorally significant chunk of voters will soon change their minds. Why might Trump’s lead be a chimera? According to one prominent theory, it’s because the inevitability of Trump’s nomination hasn’t broken through to voters who are unhappy with Joe Biden but who will ultimately come home. As the Editorial Board’s John Stoehr noted in a widely shared thread Tuesday on X, “Most people still don’t quite believe Trump is going to be the Republican Party’s nominee.” Once they do, he says, “a switch will turn on.” This theory supposes that the polling disadvantage will vanish like George Santos from the House floor or the Critical Race Theory panic from the local school board meeting. I’ll admit to thinking some version of this might be at work; voters simply aren’t taking another Trump term seriously enough, and once they do, surely they will come to their senses and start telling pollsters that they will back Biden. The trouble with this theory is that it should already be working its magic, and there is no evidence that it is. We’re halfway through February, not mired in some slow-news-cycle August afternoon the year before the election. The more time passes with Trump leading in polling averages, the less likely it is that there is anything particularly mysterious at work here at all. Trump is utterly dominating the Republican nominating contests thus far and is leading his only remaining challenger, Nikki Haley, by more than 30 points in her home state of South Carolina. His campaign, his voluminous legal troubles, and his own personal, ceaseless antics have been fixtures in the news for months. Even if you argue that there are warning signs in the outcomes for him, there can’t be much remaining doubt that he will claim the GOP nomination. And that means that all the special election overperformances, 2022 exuberance, multiple consecutive cycles of poor performance from the MAGA-fied GOP, and righteous post-Dobbs anger have to, at some point, add up to a polling lead for Joe Biden. Unless and until that happens, arguing that Biden is a lock to win in spite of the evidence in front of you is to substitute disbelief for empirical reality. As Rosenberg put it incredulously, “The theory is that all this—the fact that Democrats just keep winning everywhere in red states and blue states, and ballot initiatives, and off-year elections, and special elections—isn’t going to translate over into 2024.” But that is exactly what the data is telling us! This denial is the same incredulity that led many to dismiss the possibility of Trump becoming the Republican nominee in 2016 despite his consistent polling leads throughout the cycle. The party decides, they said. No one so despised by their party establishment had ever captured a major party nomination—until one did. It is the same incredulity that led many voters to stay home or vote for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson in 2016. It has now been almost nine years since the guy descended down the elevator at Trump Tower yapping incoherently about Mexican rapists and how we “should’ve taken” Iraq’s oil and free-associating about the hotels ISIS was building in Syria. Nothing about him has changed since that day, or will ever change. And if Democrats are to hand him one last defeat and avoid the almost unfathomable catastrophe of a second Trump term, they are going to have to start acting like they understand just how close they are to disaster.

,,," Part of the McClatchy Media Network Tuesday, February 20, 2024 Today's eEdition While the early primary results suggest the country is hurtling toward a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, many Americans believe alternative candidates could be swapped in. Nearly half of U.S. adults, 48%, believe it’s somewhat or very likely that Biden will be replaced as the Democratic nominee — potentially due to his age and mental fitness, according to a Feb. 15 poll from Monmouth University. A smaller share, 32%, said it was likely Trump would be replaced, perhaps because of his legal troubles, according to the poll, which sampled 902 people over the phone and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points. But, short of being defeated in the primaries, how could Biden or Trump be swapped out? There are a few scenarios through which new candidates could be named, though they are unlikely and without much precedent, elections experts told McClatchy News. Though he suffers from record-low approval ratings, Joe Biden has an enormous lead over his challengers and the full backing of the DNC, meaning he is unlikely to be forced to step aside. That leaves the possibility of him voluntarily choosing to drop out of the race — which could happen at one of two points, Wesley Leckrone, a political science professor at Widener University, told McClatchy News in an email. First, he could announce he is not seeking re-election before the primaries are over, which would throw the nominating contest into chaos. “If Biden were to announce that he was dropping out today it would be difficult, if not impossible, for other Democrats to get their names on the ballots in upcoming primary states due to filing deadlines,” Leckrone said. Marianne Williamson, who dropped out in early February, and Rep. Dean Phillips, may already be on the ballots in some states, though, he said. Newly announced candidates could launch write-in campaigns, but it’s unlikely any of them — at this stage in the election cycle — would garner a majority of the delegates necessary to win the party nomination, he said. In this scenario, Biden’s delegates, including those awarded in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, would become unpledged and able to vote for whomever they saw fit, Douglas Kriner, a professor of government at Cornell University, told McClatchy News in an email. “The result would be a full-on open convention with the delegates picking a nominee, potentially over multiple rounds of ballots,” Kriner said. There is some modern historic precedent for this. In 1968, after a poor performance in the New Hampshire primary, President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election. “Senator Robert Kennedy then threw his hat into the race and (Eugene) McCarthy and Kennedy battled each other in a series of primary contests through California, when Senator Kennedy was assassinated while celebrating his victory,” Kriner said. Then, during the Democratic Convention, the nomination was awarded to Vice President Hubert Humphrey — after a single round of voting, Kriner said. However, some party rules have changed since 1968, meaning it’s not a direct comparison to now, Leckrone said. The second possibility is that Biden could announce he is stepping aside after receiving the party nomination, he said. At that point, the party would have to make a determination on a new candidate. However, “There is no single natural heir to Biden in the Democratic party,” meaning the DNC’s effort to replace him would undoubtedly be tumultuous, Leckrone said. These possibilities, though, are “extremely unlikely,” David Barker, professor and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, told McClatchy News in an email. “That said, I don’t know what his health is really like,” Barker said. “It may be worse than we know.” Donald Trump, the overwhelming favorite to win the GOP nomination, is also unlikely to abdicate his position voluntarily, Leckrone said. “The RNC rules state that the nominee can be replaced due to ‘death, declination, or otherwise,’” Leckrone said. “Given Trump’s stranglehold on positions of power within the GOP power structure it seems like a particularly long shot for him to be replaced for ‘declination.’” However, the criminal proceedings against him could prove to be his Achilles’ heel, Barker said. Should Trump be convicted in court, he could lose a large share of his support, a January Morning Consult/Bloomberg poll found. A slim majority of swing state voters, 53%, said they would not vote for Trump if he is convicted, according to the poll. “I think if he were to get convicted of one of these big crimes he’s charged with before the convention, then the GOP would probably move to choose someone else,” Barker said. It’s worth remembering that some Republicans tried keeping Trump from receiving the nomination in 2016 through an attempt to add a “conscience clause,” which would have freed pledged candidates to vote for whomever they wanted, Kriner said. However, Trump — who has been charged with 91 felony counts in four criminal cases — has moved to delay his trials until after the election. “It looks like none of the trials are going to be done by then,” Barker said, so they appear “extremely unlikely” to affect his chances of receiving the GOP nomination. This means that, barring unforeseen circumstances — and despite polls showing widespread disapproval of a Biden-Trump rematch — the pair will likely fend off their challengers and face off once again in November.

,,'Vote and get home': Anxious voters say on Election Day,"  She carefully planned a five-hour drive to the polling place in her Tennessee hometown to vote on Election Day. She considered the traffic, the weather, the surging coronavirus pandemic and — something she never imagined having to contemplate — the possibility of civil unrest in the aftermath of an American election. The last four years have delivered so many shocks that anything seemed possible to Lacey Stannard, the wife of a soldier. She had tried to get an absentee ballot sent to her home on a military base on the other side of the state. But the clerk in her hometown refused. A part of her thought it was crazy to drive 10 hours roundtrip to cast a Democratic vote in deep-red Tennessee, but a larger part thought it was worth it to register her displeasure. Americans voting on Election Day are exhausted from constant crises, uneasy because of volatile political divisions and anxious about what will happen next. Like those who cast ballots early, their agony is not in deciding between President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden Most made that choice long ago. Instead, those voting in record numbers say basic democratic foundations feel suddenly brittle: Will their vote count? Will the loser accept the result? Will the winner find a way to repair a fractured, sick and unsettled nation? Stannard, a 28-year-old mother of two, hit the road Monday evening to arrive at the polls early on Election Day, only to turn around and rush home before an uncertain conclusion might aggravate a nation already on edge — fear she blames on the president’s penchant for pitting people against each other. “When the election results start trickling in, I would rather be safe at home, which is sad because never in my life... would I have thought I have to hurry up and vote and get home so that I wouldn’t have to be fearful,” she said. “Which is one of the reasons I’m driving five hours to vote because I shouldn’t have to feel that way.” Across the country, Americans say the stress of this election has made them physically ill. Others have obsessively tracked polls to soothe their nerves, or bought guns, or researched moving abroad, or retreated to a cabin in the woods. Tension has ratcheted up, as each side believes the other is threatening to usher in the end of America as we know it. On Tuesday morning in the critical battleground suburbs of Detroit, 57-year-old Karama Mishkoor and her daughter planned to vote, go to work and immediately head home. “Please, please, please don't go anywhere else,"" Mishkoor begged her daughter, 24-year-old Ashley. Mishkoor, a devout Catholic and immigrant from Iraq, said she fled that country decades ago for peace, stability and freedom, and she's sad that now this nation seems so shaken. They support Trump, but didn't put signs in the yard because there's so much anger. Ashley Mishkoor said she'd seen the partisan vitriol piling up on social media and wondered: What if that cracks open in real life? “This week is really scary,"" she said. “I'm just hoping, whatever way it goes, there's peace in our country."" A nation already uncertain about its future amid a worsening pandemic, an economic sucker punch and series of police killings that forced a national reckoning on racism is now contemplating the added threat of possible clashes in the wake of Election Day. Caravans of Trump supporters clogged traffic around the New York metropolitan area this weekend. In Texas, cars and pickup trucks festooned with Trump flags swarmed a Biden campaign bus, sometimes boxing it in. Trump criticized the F.B.I. for investigating the incident, calling the drivers “patriots.” Weeks ago, a group of men were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap the Democratic governor of Michigan. Gun sales are through the roof. Last week, Walmart announced it removed ammunition and firearms from displays, citing “civil unrest.” Trump has refused to promise a peaceful transfer of power. He told a far-right group to “stand back and stand by.” About 7 in 10 voters say they are anxious about the election, according to an AP-NORC poll last month. Only a third are excited. Biden supporters were more likely than Trump voters to be nervous — 72% to 61%. But Trump’s supporters, too, said they feel a sense of dread. The president has warned them that if he loses the country would lurch toward socialism, crime would consume the streets, freedom would buckle under political correctness. “If we let that other guy in, all hell is going to break loose,” said Dan Smith 53, who is retired from law enforcement in Norfolk, Virginia. He said he’s supporting Trump because he’s concerned about “law and order.” As the coronavirus crisis surges to more than 9 million infections and 230,000 dead, the election for many is a referendum on how Trump has handled the pandemic. In the final days of the campaign, he has continued to downplay the toll it has taken, and many of his supporters say they find no fault in his response. In New Albany, Ohio, Jason Baker, a 44-year-old real estate agent, said that despite the fact that he and his family all had COVID-19 two months ago, he cast his ballot for Trump. He believes the pandemic has “been highly politized to the point where it’s disgusting.” He described his vote as “a chess move” toward protecting the issues most important to him: law enforcement and the economy. But Theresa McGarity in Mount Clemens, Michigan, lost her mother to COVID in April at 76 years old. She was a God-fearing woman and had been teaching her 8-year-old great-granddaughter how to crochet. On Friday night, McGarity brought the child to an art installation: they filled a lawn with shoes, each representing one of Macomb County’s approximately 1,000 dead from the virus. A raucous pro-Trump demonstration down the street could be heard as they read the age and hometown of each of their dead. “I guess because it hit home, it’s not political anymore. It’s a plain, simple right and wrong,” said McGarity, who already cast a ballot for Biden. “When someone in leadership is aware of something that could flip your whole world upside down and they don’t inform you. And you have the right to vote to change that, shame on you if you don’t.” Early voting numbers — nearly 90 million by Saturday morning — suggest 2020 will shatter voter turnout records. Trump has alleged that widespread absentee voting will lead to fraud, though there is no evidence to support that claim. In Topeka, Kansas, Roger Randel, a 48-year-old pastor and Trump supporter, voted early in person, citing stories of mail-in ballots found in trays of mail discarded in a Wisconsin ditch — a case the White House seized on to cast doubt on the election’s integrity. The Wisconsin Elections Commission later reported that no election ballots from that state were among the discovered parcels. “If there are honest and fair elections, yes, I think they will be respected, but if there’s a lot of fraud that’s been caught and seen, I think it throws a damper on the election integrity,” Randel said. And in Wichita, 51-year-old Michael Long, a former civil engineer, also voted for Trump in person early instead of mailing his ballot, then planned to later check online to be sure it was counted. Long said he’s had “a falling out” with friends and family because of the “elevated emotional tension.” In Macomb County, Terry Frandle hung Trump banners outside his house and noticed that neighbors who used to stop to chat crossed to the other side of the street, not even offering a “hello.” Some drivers wave, some flip the bird. He doesn’t blame Trump for the discord — he blames Democrats and the media for failing to give Trump a fair shake, he said. He plans to vote in person on Election Day. “I just don’t trust anything anymore,” he said — except for what he hears directly from Trump. On the other side of the aisle, too, people are grappling with emotional political tension. In the Chicago suburbs, Phyllis Delrosario, 73, said her mood vacillates from excitement to depression. She researched moving to another country if Trump is reelected because she thinks democracy will “cease to exist.” She worries she’s taking her emotions out on her husband. Delrosario said she has a short fuse, and she blames Trump. “I just feel like I’m this raw exposed nerve all the time, and the anxiety of all this and the chaos of ‘what’s he going to destroy next?’ What thing is he going to step on next?’ It’s horrible,” she said. In Dunedin, Florida, Charles Oppermann dropped his ballot for Biden off Thursday then retreated to a mountain cabin in North Carolina to disconnect. Oppermann, 55, spent 11 days in the hospital battling coronavirus. A few week ago, he was lying in bed, scrolling through Twitter and came across an altered photo of Trump, his skin pockmarked with red, spiky coronavirus blobs. Panicked, he got out of bed and turned on the TV to try to get that image out of his mind. He believes his intense reaction was a combination of trauma from his infection and anxiety about the election. In the Pittsburgh suburbs, Carla Dundes, a retired 66-year-old, has settled into a nervous pre-election routine. Each day, she checks the county website’s tally of mailed ballots, monitors COVID infection numbers and scrolls the latest polls. That doesn’t calm her nerves, so she centers herself behind her Steinway piano to play. “I want my life back,” she said. “I want to be able to have my evenings where we read and we watch frivolous TV shows and I don’t have to listen to the news obsessively.” She, and other Democrats, said favorable polls for Biden bring back bad memories from Election night 2016, when they thought Hillary Clinton was cruising to victory then Trump eked out a win. Back then, Meghan Iliesiu, a 32-year-old stay-at-home mother in Oakland County, Michigan, voted third-party. She never thought Trump would win. Now she believes he’s made the country more hateful and divided. She decided long ago to vote for any Democrat who ran against him, but her husband was still leaning toward voting third-party. They went out for a drive this summer, saw lots of Trump yard signs and he changed his mind. They both cast their ballots for Biden. Now the wait is excruciating, Iliesiu said. “I feel really helpless,” she said. “Because I feel that there’s just no good outcome. If Trump wins, that’s the worst outcome. And if Biden wins, is the transition going to go smoothly? And what’s going to happen with the approximately 50 percent of Americans who do vote for Trump?” Trump at a recent debate declined to clearly condemn white supremacy. As a Black woman, Charlotte Moss, 64, of Oakland County, Michigan, decided not to live in fear. She had become increasingly concerned about emboldened militant racist groups. It had once seemed outrageous that leaders would stoke racial tensions to pit Americans against each other, maybe even violently. But that doesn’t seem so outrageous anymore, she said. She had never owned a gun, but about a month ago, bought one. She took a class at the Detroit chapter of the National African American Gun Association. Chad King started the club in 2017, and it’s grown to 210 members. In the weeks before the election, he scheduled two courses on deescalating tense situations. They sold out in three days. “For the Black community, there are so many things at stake right now,” said Linnea Pace, 57, in the Atlanta suburb Decatur. Trump, she believes, wants to erode civil rights measures and turn back the clock to a darker time. She voted on the first day of early voting in Georgia. Michelle McDonald got chills when she submitted her early ballot for Biden in Macomb County last week. As a Black woman, she hadn’t experienced that sensation since voting for Barack Obama. It felt like that monumental of a moment. She was anxious as she walked into the clerk’s office, but as she walked out she felt something different: hope. “I did my part,” she said. “I have faith that no matter what happens things are going to get better. God has us all.” __ Associated Press journalists Sharon Cohen in Chicago; Matt Sedensky in Philadelphia; Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida ; Jeff Martin in Decatur, Georgia; Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia; Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus, Ohio; Andy Tsubasa Field in Topeka, Kansas; Roxana Hegeman in Wichita, Kansas and Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report.

,,,"            64     by AHTRA ELNASHAR | The National Desk WASHINGTON (TND) — Voters in Michigan who are angry with President Joe Biden over his support for Israel have sent his campaign a loud and clear message: He cannot take their support for granted. An effort to protest the president by voting ""uncommitted"" in the state's presidential primary -- called the 'Listen to Michigan' campaign -- on Feb. 27 gained momentum after prominent progressive organization Our Revolution announced its support for the plan. ""Tell Biden, stop the death and destruction now"" the group's pledge sign up page reads. Attendees wave flags and fly signs during a rally in support of Palestine in Dearborn, Detroit on Oct. 10, 2023. (Matthew Hatcher/Detroit News via AP) As of Monday, the death toll in Gaza since October 7 exceeded 29,000, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. While some staunch critics refuse to recognize any statistics from Hamas, the United Nations has said the ministry's figures have been historically consistent with their own. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has also endorsed the protest vote. The president is aware of the pushback: Earlier this month he sent top aides to Michigan to meet with Arab and Muslim community leaders. Those two groups represent a voting bloc Biden cannot afford to lose. In 2020, Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes. The state is home to more than 206,000 Muslim registered voters, according to Emgage, a network of organizations focused on Muslim political engagement. Biden's attempt at outreach also comes after a November poll from the Arab American Institute found that his support among Arab voters plummeted from 2020, especially in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, when it was 60% to a mere 19%.

Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said she's had tough conversations with the president about this. ""I’ve got a lot of constituents, a lot of people that are neighbors and friends who are hurting, who have lost family, are scared for their family who have no food, no health care, no water. This is an issue that he’s got to talk about with people head-on. Donald Trump doesn’t offer any solutions, either,"" Dingell said in an interview with Fox News Monday. Some Democrats, like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who also serves as co-chair for Biden's reelection campaign, have urged members of her party to keep up their support for the president instead of inadvertently helping former President Donald Trump, who won the state by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2016. El-Sayed pushed back on criticism that it will benefit Trump, emphasizing the protest vote's focus is on the Democratic primary, not necessarily the general election. ""While it’s clear that Biden will win the primary, it’s critical for him and his team to understand that votes in November have to be EARNED. And by voting uncommitted, I have the opportunity to count myself among the votes he’s putting in jeopardy in November,"" El-Sayed said in his post.

Biden's harshest public remarks about Israel came earlier this month when he called its conduct in the Gaza Strip ""over the top."" In private, Biden reportedly called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “pain in my a**."" The U.S., along with Qatar and Egypt, have served as intermediaries between Hamas and Israel on a potential deal for the release of hostages in exchange for at least a temporary ceasefire, but the president has not joined calls by other world leaders in calling for a permanent ceasefire.

,,"Republicans want no part of Haley. If you want Biden to win, you should thank them for that.","And now a quick thank you to Republicans. No, really. Thank you. For what? Well, for repeatedly picking Donald Trump over Nikki Haley.   That is a bold move and I applaud it.   Haley, a former South Carolina governor and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is a skilled politician with experience governing a state and representing the United States on the global stage. She seems kind of reasonable and has zero accusations of trying to lead a political coup after losing a presidential election.   Her followers don’t wave “Haley” flags more than American ones. She isn’t trying to sell footwear to help pay legal bills and she has, to my knowledge, never even been accused of rape.   Trump sneakers?Whichever presidential candidate offers the best footwear gets my vote. Oh, and she’s not in her 70s yet and has shown a willingness to find some middle ground on policies that, though still very Republican, have a chance at attracting moderates and Democrats who aren’t sure about Joe Biden.   In short, she is the perfect candidate to beat President Biden. So, thank you for not choosing her and making it so that Biden has a better-than-decent chance of winning this thing despite his lagging polls and all the noise around his age.   This doesn’t mean that I’m a supporter of her policies, you understand. She supports an abortion ban, though has softened a little on the messaging following a string of election losses for Republicans on the topic.   Haley has consistently promised to change Medicare for younger generations. She is a supporter of Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy and has focused on “sanctuary cities” as a way to get tough on immigration. She wants no part of gun reform despite guns being the No. 1 killer of children and gun violence growing exponentially over the past few years.   Nikki Haley:Trump's proposed tariff would hurt American workers. And reignite inflation. You know, she’s a Republican. But she also has appeal to the voting base that Republicans need to win and so far haven’t been able to attract. Those annoying independent voters, whom she won over in New Hampshire.   Haley has consistently appealed to them throughout this Republican nomination process. Her economic policies of “smaller government” and debt control plays directly to that voting base. There is polling that shows she’s already beating Biden even though she's heading to a blowout defeat in Saturday's South Carolina primary. She's going to lose her home state. This makes it particularly good that Republican voters want no part of her – if you want Biden to win.   Biden, on the other hand, is wide open for an election loss. And while I don’t think he’ll lose to either candidate, Haley is by far his biggest threat because Republicans will vote Republican no matter what. Democrats will vote feelings, as they did in 2016. And right now there is a growing sentiment among Democrats that Biden isn't the guy for them. Once we get to the general election, voters will have a reminder of why they voted against Trump in 2020 and why they’ve voted against MAGA in every election since. They’ll see his toxic form of political bullying for what it is and will again decide they want no part of it.   Evangelicals support Trump:Trump's questionable morality gets a pass from evangelical voters. I decided to ask why. They’ll do all of that without paying too much attention to Biden’s age or his policy in Gaza, both of which are huge turn-offs for voters.   Couple Trump’s chaos with an economy that is improving and legislation that goes toward infrastructure and gun reform, and you have an election where one mumbling 81-year-old is clearly better than the babbling 77-year-old.   Meanwhile, Haley will be watching from the sidelines. So, one last time. Thank you, Republican voters.   Louie Villalobos is deputy opinion editor for USA TODAY.

,,2024 primary elections: the GOP and Democratic races to watch in Texas,"Primary elections for both Republicans and Democrats are shaping up to give voters a chance to weigh in on major schisms between party factions in Texas. On the Republican side, many differences of opinion rest on the policies and approach of former President Donald Trump. For Democrats, candidates with progressive ideas are facing off against those who lean moderate, and say they’re interested in working on a bipartisan basis in Washington. Alexandra Samuels, a senior editor at Texas Monthly covering politics, and Mark Jones, a political science fellow at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, broke down some of the state’s biggest primary races. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below. This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity: Texas Standard: Now, before we get into the state races, let’s talk some presidential politics here. Former President Trump is leading in all the polls, from what we can tell. But Nikki Haley, I understand, made some campaign stops in Texas. Alex, did you pick up on any message to voters here?  Alexandra Samuels: Yes. So Haley pitched herself as the best person to vote for if people want to see something new. So for at least the past year or so now, voters across the nation have told pollsters that they don’t want a repeat of the 2020 election, meaning they don’t want to see Biden versus Trump again, even though that’s looking more and more likely. But Haley was telling Texas voters that if they really do want to go in another direction, she’s the best and really only candidate for them. Plus, Texas is an open primary state, and Haley’s implied previously that she wants Democratic and independent voters to cross over and cast ballots in the GOP primary to cut into Trump’s lead here. The problem with her message is that it’s falling on deaf ears, or at least it seems to be. So, Mark, I believe it was your poll from the University of Houston that gave Trump like a 60 percentage point lead. Mark Jones: Yeah, it was 80% to 19%. Wow. That’s remarkable. I remember we talked about that a little bit earlier, but, professor, what do you think about that open primary aspect of this race? I mean, is it possible we’ll see a lot of Democrats perhaps moving to support Haley, given her direct appeal to them?  Mark Jones: That’s very doubtful. We tend to not have that much crossover voting. And effectively for many Democrats, while they would prefer Haley to Trump, they prefer Joe Biden than Nikki Haley. And so they’re very unlikely to get involved in the primary. For it to work it, requires perhaps Nikki Haley doing a concerted outreach effort among Democrats and independents. But the more you do something like that, the more it boomerangs on you and causes Republicans to desert you. So Haley’s in a really difficult situation. She faces a primary in her home state of South Carolina on the 24th, where she’s likely to lose by 30 points. Right now, the message she gave us in Texas was she’s going to stay in till the bitter end and she is the last person standing, but it’s going to be tougher and tougher for her to stay in the race if she is delivered a shellacking in her home state of South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday does very poorly, as seems to be the case. It seems like there’s another major race we should turn our attention to, maybe the biggest in Texas right now – the Senate primary race, on the Democratic side. This, by the way, for the seat that’s currently held by incumbent Ted Cruz on the Republican side. On the Democratic side, you have a very crowded field with frontrunners Colin Allred and Roland Gutierrez. Alex, what are you looking for in that race?  Alexandra Samuels: I’m interested to see whether this race will go into a runoff. And just on the polling we’ve seen, I’d say that’s incredibly likely. Allred, of course, has this huge fundraising advantage over everyone else in the field. And I’ve seen over the last couple of days that he’s racked up pretty notable endorsements from a number of editorial boards. But still, there’s a large chunk of voters who don’t know who he is and perhaps more notably, don’t know who they’re going to support in the race. So in a recent story I wrote on the race, we cited a January poll from Emerson College which showed Allred netting only 29% support, compared with Gutierrez’s 7%. But the number that stood out to me is that 37% of respondents were still undecided in this race, with just a few weeks out. » RELATED: Check out our interviews with both Rep. Colin Allred and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez Mark, I want to turn to you about this race in the Houston area, the 18th Congressional district. Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee running again after her loss for Houston mayor. Some are saying this primary could be her most competitive in years. Is that how you see it?  Mark Jones: Oh, definitely. I mean, this is really the most competitive primary she has had since her first one back in 1994, when she actually won the seat for the first time. She’s challenged by Amanda Edwards, a former city council member who’s out-fundraised the congresswoman and I think is in striking distance. It’s one of those races where the congresswoman – that’s Sheila Jackson Lee as we referred to her in Houston, ‘the congresswoman’ – she has a substantial base of support that’s very loyal and very, very likely to turn out for. But if Amanda Edwards can get more nontraditional voters, younger voters and Anglo voters in this African American-majority district to turn out in larger numbers, she has a realistic chance of defeating Jackson Lee. And since there’s a third minor candidate in the race, there’s always the possibility that this goes to a may runoff. But this is clearly the biggest threat that Jackson Lee has ever had. And it’s ironic in that the only reason why Amanda Edwards is running against Sheila Jackson Lee is that Sheila Jackson Lee ran for mayor. And had she won, then there wouldn’t have been an issue. But since she lost, now she’s facing Amanda Edwards because Amanda Edwards was running for mayor, but left the race when Sheila Jackson Lee entered it. Alex, let’s talk about Congressional District 26 – a North Texas seat, made vacant by retiring Michael Burgess, a Republican. Very crowded field. What can you tell us about it?  Alexandra Samuels: It is a very crowded field. In total, there are 11 candidates running in the GOP primary, and many of them have pretty impressive resumes. So Luisa Del Rosal, for instance, previously helped lead the office of Rep. Tony Gonzalez in the 23rd Congressional district. Scott Armey, the former Denton County judge, is also in the race. But right now, the frontrunner to replace Burgess is a 29-year-old newcomer named Brandon Gill. So you might not have heard of Gill before, but you almost certainly have heard of his father-in-law, Dinesh D’Souza. So Gill has the endorsement of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and is pitching himself sort of as an extension of the former president. So he cited fortifying the border wall as a principal policy objective of his, which in his telling, means deporting migrants that he says Biden has brought into the country. But again, with so many candidates, it’s very likely this race will go into a runoff. And what’s also complicating this race is the presence of another hard-charging social conservative on the ballot, and that’s John Huffman. He’s the mayor of Southlake, and he’s trailing very closely behind Gill in terms of fundraising and endorsements. And, professor, I want to move to District 23. Alex mentioned immigration. And of course, this has been prominent and a big part of the conversation leading up to the primary. This district covers like 800 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, including Eagle Pass. It also includes Uvalde. Republican Congressman Tony Gonzalez currently holds that seat on Capitol Hill, but is facing criticism from within his own party – even being censured by the GOP in 2023. What do you see in here?  Mark Jones: Well, Gonzalez took many positions, particularly in 2023 and 2022, that were in the moderate realm in that he voted, for instance, for gun control legislation after the Uvalde massacre. He’s one of the few Republicans to do so. And he adopted a more moderate position on the border. Now since late 2023 and into 2024, he shifted back to the right as he has his primary challenge from people like Brandon Herrera and Victor Avila. So this is a race where I think Gonzales runs the risk of being outflanked on his right by more conservative Republicans. He has a fundraising advantage. He has all the advantages of incumbency, but it’s possible he gets pushed to a runoff. And if it gets pushed to a runoff, then you get a more rarified group of primary voters who tend to be more conservative. And then Gonzales could be vulnerable. But right now, I think he’s probably shifted enough to the right where he’s put himself in a decent position to retain his seat, though not without some effort. Copyright 2024 KUT News.

,,"Trump Tells His Supporters Not to Vote in the Next Election, Which Would Actually Be Great for Humanity","  BY BESS LEVIN If you’ve lived through the last five years and haven’t been forced to medicate yourself to the point of unconsciousness, you’re probably aware that Donald Trump has been very bad for society, on account of the racism and the corruption and the mass casualties and the general, ongoing assault on democracy. Because of that, it would be ideal if neither the 45th president nor his acolytes sat at the seat of power ever again, though, unfortunately, that’s no sure thing. For one thing, Republicans have a shot at flipping the Senate in 2022, and there are a disturbing number of GOP lawmakers there whom Trump has wrapped around his morally bankrupt finger. For another, Trump is reportedly “laying the groundwork” for a 2024 run, and if you recall, 74 million people inexplicably voted for him in 2020, which wasn’t enough to actually win but was a disturbing number nevertheless. Obviously also at issue is that since Trump lost to Joe Biden, Republicans have responded by attempting to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible. Allies of the former guy have been paving the way to meddle in future elections by passing bills that “allow Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds,” which would, per The Atlantic, let state legislatures or their appointees interfere “in local decision-making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona, Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020: throw out ballots in rival strongholds in order to overturn a statewide result.” Which is bone-chillingly terrifying. But you know what would be great? If somehow we could wave a magic wand and ensure that none of the people who support Trump or Trump-endorsed candidates show up to vote, which would be a tremendous turn of events for humanity, though one that would clearly never happen unless—what? What’s that you say? Donald Trump has, in an incredible self-own, told his base to stay home and not vote in the next two elections? This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Setting aside for a moment the idea of Trump instructing millions of people not to vote, which would have the obvious effect of helping the other side, it’s important to note that Trump is still—still!—clinging to the idea that the 2020 election was stolen and there is a chance it could be overturned and he could be “reinstated” at the White House. That’s extremely scary because, in case anyone missed it the first thousand times, there is absolutely zero evidence that fraud played a role in the last election, despite multiple attempts by conservatives to conduct “audits” of results in battleground states, which have thus far only proven how badly Trump lost. Nevertheless, we absolutely love the idea of Trump throwing a hissy fit and saying, “Oh yeah? You won’t overturn Joe Biden’s win? My people will show you!” First, because it underscores how very, very stupid he is, and second, because he and his allies have done this in the past and it predictably worked out great for Democrats. As the Daily Beast notes: After prominent Trump supporters similarly told Georgia Republicans to sit out the two runoffs in that state late last year, calling it “another rigged election,” voters ended up giving Democrats control of the Senate. As Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings told Politico in January, “That’s on [Trump]. He told them their votes didn’t count, and some of them listened.”  $2.50 $1/mo for 1 year + a free tote. In a sad attempt to spin Trump’s directive as the exact opposite of what he said, GOP rally organizer John Fredericks told The Washington Post he thought Trump was simply warning voters that they need to get more involved to safeguard future elections, an explanation we’re sure the ex-president will blow up by clarifying that no, he specifically meant for people to stay home.

,,," Part of the McClatchy Media Network Tuesday, February 20, 2024 Today's eEdition Nikki Haley's team is bracing for a home state embarrassment in South Carolina's Republican presidential primary on Saturday. Conventional wisdom suggests she'll be forced to drop out. But that may not apply in 2024. Ahead of a major speech on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she's staying in the race no matter what at least until after another 20 states vote through Super Tuesday on March 5. That's even as Donald Trump's MAGA movement is furious that she's refusing to drop out. After all, she's the last major candidate standing in his path to the nomination. The Associated Press spoke with Haley and several senior campaign officials and donors about her strategy ahead of the big speech. Here are some takeaways about how and why she plans to stay in the race: Haley knows there is speculation she may drop out on Tuesday. But she told The Associated Press that she's not going anywhere until at least after Super Tuesday. Yes, that's even if she's blown out by Donald Trump in her home state in Saturday's South Carolina primary. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In case you don't believe her, her team provided new details about her plans post-South Carolina. She's spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan. Her post-South Carolina travel schedule features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Just don't ask Haley which primary state she's going to win. It's a fair question for someone who says she has a legitimate path to winning the Republican president nomination. But Haley and her team aren't willing to answer that question specifically. Or maybe they can't. That's because polls suggest she's a major underdog in virtually every state — even the state where she lives and was elected twice as governor — given Trump's grip on the Republican Party. Remember, Republican primary elections are typically decided by the party's most energized partisans — not the broader swath of moderates and independents that are more influential in general elections. Haley had a fiery answer when pressed on her specific prospects for victory during the AP interview. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” she said. Still, Haley's team says there are several states where she can be competitive with Trump — especially those with open or semi-open primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate instead of just hardcore Republicans. Stop us if you've heard this before, but most presidential candidates do not drop out when they lose; they drop out when they run out of money. The conditions are related, of course. Who wants to waste money on a loser? But somehow, even as the losses begin to pile up, Haley is raising money at the strongest rate of her political career. Traditional Republican donors like Eric Levine, who hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month, said he's betting big that Haley will somehow find an opening if she stays patient given Trump's legal baggage and propensity for major gaffes and scandal. There's also a more emotional appeal. Many in the party just aren't ready to surrender to Trump's MAGA politics even if the math is on his side. Or as Levine puts it, “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the altar of Donald Trump."" Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, according to campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever. She raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. As Trump calls Haley names like “stupid” and “birdbrain,” Haley is sharpening her focus on the Republican former president's legal troubles. Again and again, she attacked Trump for spending as much — or more — time in the courtroom as on the campaign trail. She predicted that Trump's political standing would change dramatically if he's a convicted felon before Election Day, while worrying aloud that the Republican National Committee would become a personal “piggy bank” for his legal fees. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” And she didn't exactly agree with Trump that every one of the 91 felony charges against him are all politically motivated. “Some, I think, are very politically motivated. Some, he’s going to have to defend himself,” she said in drawing a clear distinction. Some Republicans want Haley to stay in the race all the way to the party's July national convention. But Haley said she isn't yet thinking much about her strategy beyond Super Tuesday. She also declined to say whether she'd drop out of the race if and when Trump hit the 50% delegate threshold to formally become the party's presumptive nominee. At the current rate, that's likely to happen sometime in March. She was also non-committal when asked if she'd help Trump on the campaign trail this fall if he ultimately secures the GOP nomination. “I don’t know what actions I’m gonna take in terms of that, but I always said that even though I have problems with President Trump, I have more problems with Joe Biden,” Haley said. And finally, we asked her if she could 100% rule out running on a presidential ticket with No Labels, a centrist third-party group that is actively courting potential candidates. She came close to taking herself out of contention, but this didn't feel like the kind of answer that would put the question to bed for good. You be the judge. “I have not had one conversation with No Labels. They have sent signals to me that they want to talk. I have told them I am not interested in talking,"" Haley said. ""I’m running as a Republican. That’s my focus is to stay in this as a Republican nominee and to win as a Republican.” This story was originally published February 20, 2024, 10:31 AM.

,,Millions of Pennsylvanians skip every election. Here’s why this year could be different," Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are aggressively pursuing people who vote sporadically or have never voted at all. Melissa Durko, a baker, and her boyfriend, Drew Heaton, a chef, sit in the backyard of their South Philadelphia rowhouse. Neither will vote in the upcoming presidential election as a matter of principle. (Emma Lee/WHYY) Ask us: What do you want to know about voting and the 2020 election? Debra Beckey thinks the country needs change in November. In the 62-year-old Wynnewood resident’s mind, things have gone downhill under President Donald Trump. The rich aren’t paying enough in taxes. The coronavirus has spread unnecessarily. Democratic candidate Joe Biden deserves a shot, says the retired drug counselor. “I really think it’s time to get someone else,” she said. “I just don’t want to see Trump get in office again.” As a resident of a crucial swing state that could determine the presidency, Beckey’s vote is coveted. For months, political campaigns have been barraging people like her with fliers, commercials and online ads urging them to participate in the election. Beckey’s take would be good news for Biden — but there’s just one problem. She isn’t planning to vote. “A lot of times when I voted I got picked a lot for jury duty,” she said. “So I stopped registering to vote, and I don’t get picked for jury duty anymore.” There are millions of Pennsylvanians who, for whatever reason, make the same decision. Beckey is part of a group more populous in Pennsylvania than those who supported either Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016: nonvoters. Neither the president nor the former Secretary of State garnered 3 million votes in the last cycle. But 39% of Pennsylvanians eligible to participate stayed on the sidelines — totaling nearly 4 million people. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are aggressively pursuing people who vote sporadically or have never voted at all — winning over even a tiny slice of that four million could help tip the state. A survey of Pennsylvanians who did not vote in 2016, found nearly half of nonvoters wanted to cast ballots on Election Day, but were held back by logistical issues — bucking the stereotype of nonvoters as people who are checked out of politics. Experts say this uniquely charged election, combined with easier access to mail-in voting, could get those nonvoters to come out to the polls in unprecedented numbers. “Interest is through the roof and the availability of mail-in participation options should more than offset any possible negative impacts of the pandemic,” said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. Your 2020 guide to voting in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is dealing with a huge mail-in voting spike, sluggish mail, a slew of lawsuits and mail-in-ballot laws that could change. Here’s what you need to know. 3 years ago After the 2016 election, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study surveyed about 7,300 nonvoters nationwide about their political attitudes and actions, including 472 in Pennsylvania. Last summer, Susquehanna University political science professors Nicholas Clark and Rolfe Peterson published a paper analyzing why those nonvoters didn’t vote. For Keystone Crossroads, Clark crunched the Pennsylvania numbers alone. His finding: 45% of surveyed nonvoters said they wanted to cast a ballot, but did not due to personal reasons, including not being registered, having to work or being sick. “I don’t think [nonvoters] are apathetic and uninterested in what’s going on,” said Clark, whose findings mirrored the national analysis. “Some of those people are simply not able to vote.” Reading resident Cinthya Delarosa, 33, planned to vote Democratic in the local races last fall, but was derailed by an eviction notice she received the day before Election Day. “That voting day I couldn’t think about nothing but … where we were going to stay,” Delarosa told Keystone Crossroads in February.  Robert Giovanetti, 53, had never cast a ballot before he was convicted of felony perjury in 2012. The Lebanon County resident said someone during his trial told him that felons are not allowed to vote — a common misconception among the hundreds of thousands of people in Pennsylvania with felony convictions. Giovanetti grew up in a family of union steelworkers — all lifelong Democrats. But in 2016, he was swayed by Trump’s promise to revitalize the steel industry. That year, he stayed home on Election Day thinking he couldn’t participate. Now, he plans to cast the first vote of his life to reelect the president. “I feel a hell of a lot happier [that I can vote for Trump]” Gionavetti said. The Trump campaign is counting on turning out more people like Giovanetti this year to make up for expected losses in the suburbs. One recent study found that nonvoters in Pennsylvania and other key battleground states prefer Trump. Overall, Democrats maintain an 8.1% edge in registered voters in Pa., but that’s down from 9.5% last year.  “Our permanent ground game, combined with our unparalleled $350 million data operation, allows us to identify those Pennsylvanians who may not have voted in the last election but support all the President has accomplished in just his first term,” Trump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager said in a statement. But the Biden campaign thinks that this year’s contest is motivating left-leaning sporadic voters and nonvoters to action. The expansion of early voting options has opened the process to more people and early indications heavily favor Democrats. Of the nearly 670,000 Pennsylvanians who have already submitted ballots for this cycle, about 75% are registered Democrats. “No matter … if they’ve never voted before at all, Pennsylvanians from all walks of life are joining the Biden coalition,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Michael Feldman in a statement.

In 2016, Elliot Martin wasn’t particularly excited about either candidate running for president, but leaned towards voting for Clinton. However on election day the handyman, now 28, was traveling out of state. “There’s probably a good chance that I would have voted if I had been in Pennsylvania,” said Martin, who lives in Lancaster. “But I didn’t know how to [get] an absentee ballot.” This year, he’s already made a plan to be at the polls on November 3. “A lot of Trump’s decisions have been pretty gross to me,” he said. “That’s for sure inspired me to vote.” About a quarter of Pennsylvania’s 2016 nonvoters were classified in the Susquehanna University survey data as “conditional” — meaning they were interested in politics, but none of the candidates inspired them enough to cast a ballot. In 2016, Philadelphia resident Melissa Durko couldn’t bring herself to vote for a system she felt had failed her time and again — and that’s the case for her again this year. “If we were no longer in a two-party system … I would consider voting,” said Durko, 31, who wants to see the U.S. adopt a state-sponsored universal health care system. “It’s basically the same person with two different masks — that’s all that it is right now.” Durko and her boyfriend, who also does not vote, have been facing unprecedented pressure this year from friends, family, and even their roommate to vote for Joe Biden. She said that’s only solidified their commitment to staying home. “I feel this way because the political system is failing me,” Durko said, while running a white noise machine so her roommate would not overhear the interview. Researcher Nicholas Clark said Democrats and Republicans typically don’t make much of an effort to win over this kind of nonvoter. “If they’ve decided that they don’t like either campaign, there is not much that the campaigns can do,” he said. But that also might be different this year. In September, Pennsylvania Democrats convinced the state supreme court to boot the Green Party off the presidential ballot, leaving left-leaning voters without another option at the top of the ticket. That means Biden may secure more voters like Joshua Reaves, a 25-year-old organizer with the Philly Socialists. He’s turned off by Biden’s centrism and his opposition in the 1970s to federally-mandated school desegregation through busing. But, he said, he’s willing to do what it takes to get Trump out of office. “I think everyone I know is really disappointed by Joe Biden, but still plans on casting a ballot for him,” Reaves said, calling it a “marked departure” from what his friends did in 2016. About 5% of Pennsylvania’s nonvoters in 2016 were classified by the Susquehanna University report as being “obstructed”: they actually tried to vote, but were thwarted by something like long lines at the polls, an undelivered absentee ballot, or intimidation at the polling place. The other major group in the survey were classified as “apathetic” — those simply uninterested in the political process. About 18% of the surveyed nonvoters fell into that group. Four years ago, Avery Johnson was one of them. “I was very ignorant to [politics],” said the 25-year-old Philadelphia resident. A lot has changed since then. Last year, Johnson had a baby. Then, in May, her grandmother got sick with coronavirus. All the while, gun violence has exploded in her West Philadelphia neighborhood. Johnson is worried about the world her son is growing up in. She thinks President Trump’s downplaying of the pandemic and what she describes as a lack of respect for Black people is making things worse. Now, for the first time in her life, Johnson plans to go to the polls. On Nov. 3, she says she’ll push the button for Biden. “I don’t know if my vote can make a change, I’m not sure, but I have a son to look after,” Johnson said. “It’s worth a try.” WHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.

,,How COVID-19 Changed Everything About the 2020 Election,"I
n the 2020 that might have been, nobody is sick and politics is the center of the universe. The Democratic Party has just nominated Joe Biden and his running mate at its mid-July convention in Milwaukee, while Republicans are gearing up to renominate Donald Trump in Charlotte, N.C. At his usual rallies, Trump is pointing to the roaring economy to make his case for re-election, while Biden struggles to stir up crowds with his plea for a return to normalcy. Trump’s allies continue to promote conspiracy theories about the Biden family’s entanglements in Ukraine, leading increasingly desperate Democrats to push for a second impeachment in the House. Both parties are campaigning furiously across the country, knocking on millions of doors to turn out voters in November.    But in the 2020 that’s actually happening, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything–from how the campaign is conducted to how we vote to what we value. It has canceled conventions, relegated fundraising and campaigning to the digital realm, and forced many states to rapidly change how people get and submit their ballots, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous results. The acute crises have refocused the nation’s attention, bringing issues like public health and economic and racial inequality to the fore and prompting the public to revisit what characteristics it wants in its leaders. For four years, Trump has been the dominant force and inescapable fact not only of national politics but also of American life. Now he finds himself displaced as the central character in his own campaign by a plague that answers to no calendar, ideology or political objective. Just as the virus has changed the way adults report to offices and children go to school, upending whole industries in the process, it has spurred a massive shift in the fundamental act of American democracy: how we select the President who will be charged with ending the pandemic’s reign of destruction, dealing with its aftermath and shaping the nation that rises from its ashes. And as with so many other changes wrought by the coronavirus, the practice of American politics may never be quite the same again. This was always going to be an unusual contest–the high-stakes re-election campaign of a historically divisive President at a pivotal moment for the nation, a referendum on his norm-shattering style and disruptive vision, a test for his scattered opposition to prove which side of a polarized political spectrum represents the mainstream. As the campaign enters its final three-month stretch, Trump trails badly in national and battleground-state polls as Americans give his dismal handling of the pandemic a failing grade. But the end of Trump’s turbulent term will be written by the virus. It startled us with its rise and spread in January and February, suspended normal life in March and April, and lulled many into complacency before whipsawing us again with its resurgence in June and July. Who knows what kind of October surprise it may have in store? Like most things these days, presidential politics has adapted in ways that can get a little weird. For example, on Facebook one recent Thursday evening, Donald Trump Jr. is rhapsodizing with the aging former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka about childhood physical abuse. “Maybe a few more kids in this country need a little bit more ass whoopin’ than participation medals!” says Trump Jr., who wears an open-necked purple polo shirt and AirPods. Ditka, whose phone is tilted upward toward his bottle-brush mustache, looks confused. “How can you say that?” he replies. “These poor kids.” The broadcast, an installment of Trump Jr.’s Triggered podcast, epitomizes the content the Trump campaign is feeding hungry supporters online. On another recent evening, it hosted “The Right View,” in which Trump Jr.’s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump’s wife Lara, and Trump campaign aides Mercedes Schlapp and Katrina Pierson laud the debunked virtues of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment in a segment that will eventually rack up more than half a million views on Facebook. The campaign was already creating such online content, but it’s newly central in a world where rallies risk becoming superspreader events. Sign up for the Inside TIME newsletter to get the exclusive story behind TIME covers. The Biden campaign has also moved online, where its presence, like its candidate, is more sedate and traditional. “Events” are advertised to local supporters and organized around constituency groups or issues, just as they would be in a normal campaign. Biden’s wife Jill appears, via Zoom, at a “virtual campaign stop” with the mayor of West Palm Beach, Fla., to talk about his plans for seniors; former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams hosts an online “racial and economic justice roundtable” with business owners in Detroit; Biden himself joins his former running mate, Barack Obama, for a stagey 15-minute “conversation” about the Trump Administration’s failures. Despite the pandemic, Trump had hoped to keep up the rallies central to his political mythology. But an attempted return to the stage in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20 turned into a debacle, with a sparse, mostly maskless crowd that barely filled the bottom deck of the indoor arena. Lately he’s settled for online “tele-rallies,” glorified conference calls that Trump supporters in key states are invited to tune in to a couple of times a week. At a recent one targeting voters in Maine and New Hampshire, Trump dutifully shouts out the local Republican candidates, extols lobster fishermen and vows to get tough on Canadian currency manipulation. Almost 13,000 people are listening live, and hundreds of thousands more will eventually “view” the half-hour audio stream. “The future of our nation will be defined by patriots who love our country and want to build it up and make it bigger and better and stronger–or it will be defined by the radical left. And usually radical left Democrats are left-wing extremists who hate our country,” he intones. In person, this kind of line would draw a roar from Trump’s throngs of admirers, but online, the only feedback is the silent scroll of Facebook comments. Trump’s political adviser Jason Miller says the tele-rallies have been a hit. “The genius of Donald Trump is that he knows how to foster and build one-on-one relationships with his voters,” he says. But it’s clear the virtual gatherings are no substitute for the real thing. Lacking his usual source of mass adulation, the President has taken to touting the crowds that line the streets when he visits various states on official business. Some local candidates–mainly Republicans–are still holding in-person events despite the risks. But the pandemic has become a vector for partisan attacks. When a GOP Senate candidate in Virginia posted a video of himself attending an indoor political event without a mask, the state Democratic Party seized on the image to call him “dangerously irresponsible.” Many state Democratic parties have chosen to hold all-virtual conventions, but several of their GOP counterparts have tried to blaze ahead. The Republican Party of Texas took its case all the way to the state Supreme Court, which sided with the Houston mayor who had canceled its in-person convention. The hastily assembled virtual confab that ensued featured extensive technical difficulties–at one point, Texas Monthly reported, pranksters invaded an online planning document and added “Peepeepoopoo” to the schedule–and by the end angry delegates ousted the state chairman. It’s been a similar story at the national level. Democrats decided early on that the planned July convention in Milwaukee would not be feasible; it was pushed back to mid-August and radically scaled down, with delegates staying home and voting remotely and Biden himself staying away. The GOP has had a bumpier road. In June, Trump moved the convention from Charlotte, N.C., to Jacksonville, Fla., in a fit of pique over the North Carolina Democratic governor’s insistence on safety protocols. As Florida’s COVID-19 caseload surged this summer, party officials made a series of frantic adjustments, culminating in a last-ditch effort to hold the festivities in an outdoor stadium in the August heat. Finally, in late July, Trump announced the Jacksonville program would be scotched; the current plan, which is still being developed, is to hold a small number of party meetings in North Carolina and have the President accept the nomination with a televised speech at a location to be determined. The lack of traditional conventions is perhaps not such a loss. Events where party insiders in smoke-filled rooms once actually picked presidential nominees and running mates have become, in the modern era, little more than infomercials. But they serve as a major engine of the parties’ fundraising–another operation that’s moved online in the age of coronavirus. The swanky catered affairs that donors once paid tens of thousands of dollars per plate to attend are now BYOB livestreams. Campaigns have had to get creative as the novelty fades. “When the stay-at-home orders started, campaigns immediately started doing virtual events–a Zoom fundraiser, a field-organizer hangout,” says Brian Krebs, who works at a Democratic digital-campaign firm called Rising Tide Interactive. “But the bar is rising now that a lot of people are Zoomed out. You’ve got to have a special guest or some kind of hook. People aren’t going to show up if it’s just 12 squares talking.” On the other hand, celebrity guests can be easier to land when they can appear at your fundraiser without leaving L.A. The Texas Democratic Senate nominee MJ Hegar recently recorded an event with the cast of Supernatural and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, none of whom were physically present. Hegar campaign volunteers have also gotten creative with their outreach, holding a voter-registration texting session that doubled as a Taylor Swift listening party. Around this time in an election, campaigns traditionally shift from registering, identifying and persuading voters to pushing them to the polls. The GOP is still doing so, knocking on a million doors a week, the Republican National Committee claims. But on the left, an intense debate has broken out about the ethics of going door-to-door amid a plague. Research suggests that in-person conversations with voters are the most effective way to get them to turn out. But most liberal groups and the Biden campaign aren’t planning on door knocking this year, viewing it as too risky for workers and voters alike. One group that forged ahead, the Progressive Turnout Project, had to suspend its operations in a dozen states after several employees tested positive for COVID-19. The irony is more Americans are eager for political engagement this year. In a Fox News poll in July, 85% said they were extremely or very motivated to vote, and the percentage of respondents who told Gallup they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting was up 10 points from 2016. Despite the difficulties of pandemic voting, primaries in states such as Texas and Georgia have set turnout records. At the same time, new voter registrations have plummeted because of the closure of government offices like departments of motor vehicles. In Pinal County, Arizona, a small progressive organization called Rural Arizona Engagement had gotten only a quarter of the way to its voter-registration goal when it had to stop canvassing in March. Attempts to continue the work by phone were mostly unsuccessful. Even though Arizona is currently a coronavirus hot spot, the group hopes to go back into the field to turn out the vote. “We feel like if we can follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and train our staff in a way that protects them and the people we’re talking to, this is a year that requires this work to be done,” says the group’s co–executive director Natali Fierros Bock. The pandemic, she says, has heightened people’s awareness of why their vote matters. (It’s also increased canvassers’ success rate: with so many people isolated in their homes, more are willing to answer the door and talk with a stranger.) Despite robust public support for wearing masks, the Pinal County board of supervisors decided against a mask mandate for businesses, and the rabble-rousing county sheriff, Mark Lamb, announced he would not enforce the state’s stay-at-home order. (Lamb was forced to cancel a planned appearance with Trump at the White House when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in June.) “People are starting to connect the dots,” Fierros Bock says, “and consider who is serving in these local offices and how much power they wield.” The pandemic landed in the midst of America’s primary-election season, forcing state election officials to adapt on the fly. The results offer a glimpse of the massive challenges the general election will pose–and the disasters that could ensue. One of the first test runs came in Ohio, whose primary was scheduled for March 17, just days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, the NBA abruptly suspended its season and states across the country began rapidly shutting down. When Republican Governor Mike DeWine sought to delay the primary, some candidates sued, and courts ruled he didn’t have the power to do so. Finally, at 4 a.m. on Election Day, with workers already starting to set up for balloting, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the state’s health director could order the polls closed as an emergency measure. But the GOP-controlled legislature wouldn’t go along with DeWine’s proposal to move the vote to June, so a mail-only election with an April 28 deadline was held instead. Other states soon had their own experiences with the logistical, constitutional and political complexities of pandemic voting. In Wisconsin’s April 7 primary–held on schedule after a last-minute standoff between its Democratic governor and Republican legislature–hundreds of polling locations were forced to close when poll workers fearful for their safety declined to show up. Hundreds of thousands of voters still turned out, standing in socially distanced lines for hours to cast their ballots. (One scientific study later tied the election to a surge in COVID-19 cases, though other researchers disagreed with that assessment.) Georgia’s June 9 primary melted down amid short staffing and technical problems, leading to endless lines and significant disenfranchisement that Democrats charged was an intentional bid by GOP officials to suppress the vote. In New York, a state that normally votes almost entirely in person, election officials blame an unprecedented flood of absentee ballots for the fact that more than a month after the June 23 election, they still haven’t declared a winner in some contests. In each case, the coronavirus struck at a system that was already fragile. “It is a mistake to think of the pandemic as something separate from other problems with our election systems,” says Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine. “It interacts with the existing pathologies to make things worse.” Hasen’s most recent book, Election Meltdown, was published on Feb. 4, the day after the calamitous Iowa Democratic caucuses, whose delayed results illustrated the problems balky election infrastructure can produce even without a worldwide epidemic. Many states that have been administering elections in person for decades are now attempting to pivot to mail voting, allowing people to vote absentee without an excuse or by citing COVID-19 as a legitimate medical reason. But not all. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Democratic lawsuit that sought to allow all Texas voters to choose mail ballots. In Georgia, the GOP secretary of state mailed every voter a ballot application for the primary but will not do so for the general election. “I think it’s because there was historic turnout, particularly among Democratic primary voters, and [Republicans] don’t want to encourage that in the general election,” says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. Some states, including California, Nevada and Vermont, will mail ballots to all voters, joining five existing states with universal mail voting. Many others will send all voters an absentee-ballot application, but experts warn they may not be prepared for the flood that is coming. Postage, postmark and notarization or witness requirements vary widely from state to state. States facing pandemic-induced budget crunches aren’t necessarily in a position to pay for protective equipment and millions of stamps, but Congress has allocated only a fraction of the election funding they’ve requested. The U.S. Postal Service, itself teetering on the brink of insolvency, is ill equipped to handle the surge, and Democrats allege the popular agency, recently entrusted to a Trump ally, may be intentionally slowing the mail in urban areas in order to help the President. States’ voting procedures continue to shift as the vote nears, making it difficult for voters to keep track of what’s required. What worries election experts the most is that all these challenges and changes could throw the result into doubt. Barring a blowout, election night is likely to end without a clear winner, and it could take weeks or months to count all the votes. “What we didn’t see in the primary, even where there was confusion or it took weeks to count, was someone calling the election rigged or stolen,” says Aditi Juneja, an attorney who staffs the bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises. “We want to make sure that happens in the general election. If the outcome is unclear or uncertain, that leaves space for bad actors to make wild claims.” That, of course, is exactly what Trump has been doing. Continuing the drumbeat he began in 2016, the President has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the vote, wrongly insisting that mail voting is not secure and that the election will be “rigged.” Trump claims there is a difference between vote by mail, which generally refers to ballots mailed to all voters, and absentee voting, when voters typically must request a ballot. But experts say there’s no difference in terms of security. Trump attacked Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, for going “rogue” when she mailed absentee-ballot applications before the state’s primary–a step many of her GOP counterparts had also taken. “It is not helpful when false or misleading information, mudslinging and partisan rhetoric are injected into the discourse,” Benson tells TIME. “It causes people to have doubts about the sanctity of the process and the validity of their vote. The truth is, we are working every day to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” On July 30, Trump suggested postponing the presidential election, prompting an immediate outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike. “The concerns the President has raised are not valid in the state of Ohio,” Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose, a Republican, tells TIME. “Both political parties in Ohio have trusted our system for 20 years and work hard to get voters to take advantage of voting by mail.” As for postponing the election, “That is not something we should even be considering,” he says. Election experts of both parties worry that Trump’s pernicious campaign to undermine confidence in the election’s integrity is a pretext for refusing to accept the result if he loses, throwing the nation into constitutional crisis or worse. When a bipartisan group of academics and former officials called the Transition Integrity Project recently war-gamed a contested election, every iteration of the exercise produced “both street-level violence and political impasse,” the group’s organizer, Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks, told the Boston Globe. When the reality of the pandemic began to set in, Trump’s approval rating initially went up, as often happens for Presidents in times of crisis. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump–which has stayed within a narrow band throughout his term–reached 46% in late March, the highest level since his Inauguration, according to the polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight. Then it began to plummet. Today, barely 40% approve of Trump’s performance, while nearly 55% disapprove. Americans now disapprove of his handling of the pandemic by a 20-point margin. Biden holds significant leads in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan. States such as Texas, Arizona and Georgia, which Democrats haven’t won at the presidential level in decades, may now be up for grabs. Many top Republicans fret that their candidates are in for a wipeout up and down the ballot. “The breadth and depth of Trump’s weakness is hard to overstate,” says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, a member of the Navigator Research team that has surveyed more than 24,000 Americans on a rolling basis since March. “There was a little bit of rally-round-the-flag at the beginning–people wanted him to succeed–and then when it was clear that he wasn’t taking it seriously, you saw that change.” In truth, Trump was an unusually weak incumbent long before the pandemic hit, the only President never to top 50% approval in Gallup’s regular tracking. His current rating remains higher than his nadir of 35% in August 2017, after the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Democrats’ current 8-point advantage on the generic ballot is about the same as their margin in the national vote in 2018. Biden has consistently held an edge over Trump, posting margins similar to or greater than the current state polls since before he even entered the race. A large portion of the American electorate seems to have made up its mind about this President early on, abandoning him–and his party–and never looking back. Indicators that normally correlate to incumbents’ political fortunes, such as the economy, may not apply this year, says GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. The situation is simply too anomalous. Many people see the pandemic as a fluke wrought by China, and may be receptive to the argument that the economic pain is not the President’s fault. Trump may also be benefiting from the popular emergency economic relief legislation Democrats helped him enact. “The country can unite behind its leaders in a crisis if they feel like things are at least moving in the right direction,” Ruffini says. “The summer’s case spike seemed to break off that possibility for the President. He’ll still have a chance to show that things have turned a corner before November, but time is running very short.” COVID-19 has changed the tenor of the election in unmistakable ways. Optimism has nosedived: the share of people who believe the U.S. is on the right track has declined 20 points since March. The pandemic has brought new urgency to issues like access to health care, inequality and the social safety net, while driving Trump’s preferred topics of immigration and trade out of the picture. “The voters are fundamentally the same, but the context of the 2020 election has changed,” says UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, author of Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America. Trump’s character flaws suddenly loom larger for voters. “For a long time, it was annoying but it didn’t necessarily change anything in their lives–‘I wish he’d stop tweeting, but the economy’s good,'” says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, which commissioned polls and focus groups of thousands of voters in suburban swing districts. “What this has done is to put the perception they already had about Trump together with real, horrific impacts on them and their family and their country.” Asked an open-ended question about Trump’s vision for the country, about half the respondents in Third Way’s surveys volunteered “self-serving” or “divisive.” Respondents also rejected his calls for “law and order” in response to street protests. Asked who is hurt by Trump’s vision, 30% of undecided suburban voters said “all of us.” “It used to be people would say LGBT people, or women, or people of color,” Erickson says. “Now, 4% say immigrants, 6% say minorities–but 30% say all of us.” Some focus-group participants were asked what they were looking for in the election. The responses were heavy on leadership qualities: people yearned for someone who was strong, compassionate and listened to experts. People agreed that Trump was strong (and questioned Biden’s strength) but rated the President abysmally on the other two. Just as Trump’s worst qualities were magnified, Biden’s strengths suddenly seem matched to the moment. When he announced his candidacy a year ago, he said he was compelled to run by Trump’s equivocal response to Charlottesville. Some Democrats criticized his mantra of a “battle for the soul of the nation” as too puffy or vague at a time when his rivals were pumping out ambitious left-wing policy proposals. But a character-based campaign, tinged with nostalgia, now looks not just prescient but essential, whether or not you believe Biden has what it takes to deliver on it. Trump’s campaign insists he is positioned for victory despite the headwinds. Public polls are undercounting Republicans, says Miller, the Trump political adviser, and the President’s supporters are more enthusiastic about voting by a 2-to-1 ratio. “Are people going to stand in line for two hours to vote for someone they’re not enthusiastic about?” he asks. But analysts in both parties are skeptical. “Overwhelmingly, voters believe the pandemic and the resulting economic meltdown are the most important issues facing the country,” says GOP pollster Whit Ayres. “Efforts to change the subject might work with people who are already in favor of the President, but there’s no evidence they’re working with the people who need to be brought into his coalition if he’s going to win.” If the pandemic has revealed the fault lines in American society, it has exposed something else too: some things are still too important to get caught up in politics. Trump’s attempts to make public health a partisan matter have mostly failed. Large majorities of Americans support their states’ pandemic restrictions, believe it’s more important to rein in the virus than to get the economy up and running, think more needs to be done and–by resounding margins–support mask wearing. The national mood has undergone a wholesale shift in this most tumultuous of election years. In Third Way’s studies, voters talked about feelings of sadness, anger, anxiety and fear. Pollsters’ response rates have skyrocketed because so many lonely, homebound people are answering the phone just to have someone to talk to. America is a divided nation, but also one that craves communion and solidarity. When a Black man was brutally murdered on video by police in Minneapolis, people took to the streets in unprecedented numbers. Three-quarters of Americans said they backed the recent racial-justice protests, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged, stunning political observers. It’s hard to imagine this happening without Trump. But it’s hard to imagine it without COVID-19 too. When one day Americans look back on this plague, the campaign it coincided with will be an inextricable part of the story. The U.S. has held elections under difficult circumstances before: wars, depressions, natural disasters. Each time, in the face of difficulty, we voted on schedule; each time, democracy gave us the opportunity to choose how we would steer out of the crisis. –With reporting by MARIAH ESPADA and ABBY VESOULIS Correction, August 6 The original version of this story misstated the location of the celebrity guests at a MJ Hegar virtual event.

,,," How race and identity are shaping politics, policy and power.      12/12/2023 01:26 PM EST With help from Ella Creamer, Rishika Dugyala, Jesse Naranjo and Teresa Wiltz POLITICO illustration/Photo by AP What up, Recast fam! President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine is in Washington today to lobby GOP lawmakers for continued support for military assistance. Days after losing her Houston mayoral runoff, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee is seeking reelection for her House seat. And Harvard President Claudine Gay holds onto her job. First, though, we focus on a new poll underscoring the president’s softening support among Black voters. One of the most respected polls of voters of color shows President Joe Biden is facing strong headwinds among his most loyal base of support: Black Americans. In the GenForward survey released on Tuesday and shared first with POLITICO, nearly 1 in 5 Black Americans, 17 percent, said they would vote for former President Donald Trump. Another 20 percent of Black respondents said they would vote for “someone else” other than Biden or Trump. According to the survey, about three-quarters of Black respondents said they would vote if the presidential election were held today, a figure that trails the number of white voters who said they would vote today by 10 points.  Was The Recast forwarded to you by a friend? Don’t forget to subscribe to the newsletter here. You’ll get a weekly breakdown of how race and identity are the DNA of American politics and policy. The GenForward survey, housed at the University of Chicago, was conducted with 3,448 eligible voters, including large oversamples with voters of color, from Nov. 8-30 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey — which was conducted over the internet with a mix of respondents who were randomly selected to join a panel and those who opted-in to participate in the survey — has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Black adults backed Biden more than any other racial group in the survey, but the president notched just 63 percent among this bloc. That total, less than a year before voters head to the polls, is jarring, given exit polls following the 2020 election showed Biden carrying Black voters by more than 90 percent. Campaign merch is seen at the headquarters of Kathy Barnette, a Republican candidate for Pennsylvania's 4th Congressional District, Oct. 30, 2020, in Philadelphia. | Laurence Kesterson/AP It also represents a significant jump for Trump among Black voters overall. During the last presidential election, AP VoteCast found Trump won just 8 percent of Black voters, versus 91 percent who voted for Biden. “It is possible, and we’ve seen it before, that a higher number, in particular Black men because of a kind of hypermasculinity of Donald Trump, could vote for Trump [again],” says Cathy Cohen, the founder and director of the GenForward project and a University of Chicago political science professor. She adds that this figure might be balanced out by the number of Black women, often thought of as the backbone of the Democratic Party’s multiracial coalition, who support Biden at higher rates than Black men. While she notes there is still plenty of time for Biden’s reelection team to message why Black voters should support the president, Cohen suggested there are troubling signs regarding turnout ahead. Chief among them were the glaring figures of 20 percent for both Black and Latino respondents who said they would not vote if the election were held today. “For younger people, it is the threat of a third-party candidate or staying at home,” that should be the real fear for Democrats, Cohen says. Overall, just 46 percent of respondents across all racial groups said they would back the current president if the election were held today, compared to 57 percent of Asian American and Pacific Islanders. Latino and white respondents were nearly identical with 42 and 44 percent, respectively, saying they’d back the current president. Biden speaks during a campaign event Feb. 15, 2020, in Las Vegas. | Patrick Semansky/AP When broken down by race, the survey found Latinos were much more likely than Black respondents to say they would vote for Trump (17 percent of Black voters compared to 36 percent of Latinos). But while the jump in Trump support among African Americans in the survey is eye-opening, the third of Latinos who expressed support for Trump in the survey is essentially flat compared to 2020 exit polls. “Polling numbers at this point are not predictive of the future,” says longtime Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher, who did not work on the GenForward survey. Belcher, a veteran of Barack Obama’s two presidential campaigns, adds that around this time in 2011, several polls indicated that Obama was losing in head-to-head matchups to both Mitt Romney, the eventual GOP nominee, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who won just two states — his home state of Georgia and neighboring neighboring South Carolina — during the Republican primary that year. “If Joe Biden fails, it’s not going to be because Black people voted for Donald Trump,” Belcher says, calling that narrative both “lazy” and oversimplified. He adds that there is a sense that all voters — especially younger voters of color — are fed up with both political parties, creating “an offramp to third-party voting, which is what we saw in 2016.” Concerns over inflation by far outpaced all other issues for respondents across all racial groups, with gun control and immigration lagging far behind. Overall, the president’s approval rating in this survey was sitting at a paltry 38 percent. For Black respondents, half approve of Biden’s job performance, while 34 percent of Latinos, 37 percent of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and 36 percent of white respondents viewed Biden positively. We’ll certainly keep an eye out as 2024 approaches to see if these trends hold. All the best,
The Recast Team  HOUSTON VOTERS END ‘THE BIG 4’ Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee lost the race for Houston mayor over the weekend. | Michael Wyke/AP She tried to follow Karen Bass’s lead. But after falling short, the “Big Four” is now down to the “Big Three.” Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the congresswoman who has represented Houston in Congress since 1995, failed in her quest to become Houston’s next mayor. Instead, voters in the largest city in the state selected Texas state Sen. John Whitmire in the mayoral runoff Saturday — and the outcome was not close. The mayor-elect, who is white, will replace the term-limited Mayor Sylvester Turner, who had supported Jackson Lee. While both are Democrats in this very blue city, the office itself is nonpartisan. Turner, who like Jackson Lee is Black, is part of the historic period where the mayors of the nation’s four largest cities — New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston — are simultaneously represented by Black mayors. It was achieved last fall when now-former Rep. Karen Bass defeated businessman Rick Caruso to become La La Land’s first woman and just the second Black person to lead the city. This unique fraternity remained intact when progressive Brandon Johnson defeated moderate Paul Vallas, who is white, to become mayor of Chicago earlier this year in a runoff. Johnson succeeded former Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who was ousted in the first round of voting. The Houston mayoral runoff featured two political titans who have represented the city in politics for decades. Whitmire, who is the longest-serving member of the Texas state Senate, knocked off Jackson Lee, now in her 15th term in Congress. The runoff focused largely on rising crime, infrastructure issues and city financial controls. Jackson Lee’s campaign was marred from setbacks down the stretch of both the general election campaign and in the runoff. As voters prepared to vote in the runoff, her campaign released an ad urging voters to “vote on or before December 7.” But the runoff was on Dec. 9 and the early voting period wrapped on Dec. 5. Whitmire and Jackson Lee speak at a mayoral forum Dec. 3 in Houston. | Lekan Oyekanmi/AP Her campaign told Houston Public Media the error was made by the agency hired to cut the ad, not the campaign itself. Before that blunder, in late October, Jackson Lee’s campaign was mired in scandal after a recording of her using expletives to demean staffers was leaked. “I know that I am not perfect. I recognize that in my zeal to do everything possible to deliver for my constituents I have in the past fallen short of my own standards and there is no excuse for that,” she said, according to the Texas Tribune. During his victory speech, Whitmire leaned into that controversy without mentioning his opponent by name. “People want to go to work for me because we respect people, we don’t bully people,” Whitmire said with a wide grin, to applause from his supporters. On Monday, Jackson Lee filed her paperwork to seek a 16th term in Congress.

,,"Instead of Challenging Joe Biden, Maybe the Green Party Could Help Change Our Democracy","  To distract myself from wondering if my chest is tightening, I sometimes think about other things that could go really wrong this year. The list is long, but somewhere near the very top is the thought that the President could somehow eke out a close election victory, despite—well, despite everything. There’s no guarantee it won’t happen. The Democrats didn’t find a perfect candidate, and there’s going to be an endless blizzard of Facebook lies, and team Trump is topnotch at voter suppression. But there are ways to lessen the odds a little, and a good one would be to not have a third-party challenge from the left this year, at least in the six or seven battleground states that are going to make the difference. That means asking the Green Party to stand down in those places. People with impressive left credentials—Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, Ron Daniels—did this already, in January, in a well-argued open letter. But it didn’t seem to work: the Party’s most likely Presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, declared that he would run even if the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, who, Hawkins told an interviewer, had been “a little slow” in his plans for reform. Hawkins has run many times for governor of New York, and also for the House and the Senate from that state, while never getting more than five per cent of the vote. (He did come in a respectable second in a Fourth District city-council race in his home town of Syracuse, in 2013.) “Recognizing the danger of Trump does not mean that electing any damned Democrat should trump all other considerations,” Hawkins said. So I probably won’t be able to persuade him, either, but let me at least offer the suggestion that there’s a particularly useful reform that Greens—and others interested in a more vibrant politics—could be working on, instead, this autumn. To understand why this reform—ranked-choice voting—seems so important to me, let me say that, by ideology, I’m pretty much a Green. One of my favorite politicians anywhere is Bob Brown, a former member of the Australian Senate, who, in 1972, helped found what was arguably the first Green Party (and also saved a large portion of Tasmania’s classic wilderness). I’ve given speeches on behalf of German Greens and European Union Greens and local Green parties in many states and cities, and, whenever Canada holds an election, I stay up to watch the returns from the island district in the Pacific, off Vancouver, just to make sure that Elizabeth May, who for many years led the nation’s Green Party, has retained her seat. So I’m about as small-“g” green as green gets, having spent my adult life working on the greatest environmental crisis in the history of our civilization, the rapid heating of our planet. But I haven’t supported the Green Party in national elections in this country, and that’s because of the way our electoral laws work. The obvious difference between the United States on the one hand and most of Europe on the other is that we have a de-facto plurality-winner-take-all two-party system that makes it all but impossible for a small party to make a non-perverse difference, while European countries have parliamentary systems with electoral mechanisms that encourage small parties to play constructively pivotal roles. Time and again, by winning five or ten or twenty per cent of the vote, and a like share of seats, the Greens who operate in parliamentary democracies have ended up with enough representatives to give them bargaining power when it came time to form coalition governments. And those bargains make big differences: having the Greens in a power-sharing government was a major reason that Germany pioneered renewable energy; currently, in British Columbia, a Green-Liberal coalition has bolstered opposition to giant pipelines. In the United States, winning a few percentage points of the vote gets you nothing, except a chance to argue about whether you were the spoiler. Ralph Nader, in 2000, and Jill Stein, in 2016, have roundly insisted that they weren’t, arguing that the Democrats who were defeated in crucial states by margins smaller than their vote totals there did not run skillful enough campaigns. Relitigating that history seems less essential than looking ahead: the last poll I saw for Wisconsin showed that the race between a Democrat and Trump, for the state that many analysts predict will sway the election, was currently within three percentage points. So, if a Green Party candidate is on the ballot and attracts even a smidgen of support—well, it could end very badly indeed. And why would you take that chance this year? That’s not to say that America wouldn’t be better off with more electoral alternatives. We clearly would. And to get them we needn’t wait for some unlikely constitutional change that might produce a parliamentary system. Instead, we can work to get more states to follow the lead of Maine, which last year introduced a ranked-choice voting system for most elections. Here’s how it works: if there are ten candidates on your ballot, you list your choices from one to ten. You can proudly vote for the Green candidate as your No. 1 choice for Congress, and, if she comes in last, you haven’t lost your vote or spoiled someone else’s chances. That’s because that vote would then be eliminated and your second-ranked vote would be counted instead, and so on, until someone has won a majority. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Reporter’s Video from Inside the Capitol Siege This is not some impossible dream of a reform—pundits used to say “as Maine goes so goes the nation,” and, indeed, last year, after Maine adopted the plan, so did New York City, with the support of seventy-three per cent of its voters. “Before the pandemic, R.C.V. was gaining momentum, with efforts teed up in several states to advance it via ballot initiative or legislative lobbying,” Josh Silver, the director of the electoral-reform campaign RepresentUs, said. “A ballot initiative for R.C.V. is likely in Alaska this year, and possibly in North Dakota and Massachusetts. There is a huge opportunity for legislative lobbying efforts in many other states, blue and red, as evidenced by the deep-red Utah legislature’s vote to allow their cities to enact R.C.V.” That is to say, Green enthusiasts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could skip Presidential campaigning and, instead, push their legislatures hard to put R.C.V. on the agenda. The pandemic has only increased the urgency, because the one drawback of a now necessary vote-by-mail system is that candidates sometimes drop out of elections after you’ve mailed in your ballot. Silver again: “This happened to millions of voters in this year’s primary, and R.C.V. fixes it. We must lean in hard to this opportunity.” If we managed to enact this reform, the result would be a much better system in many ways. One is that you could really build small progressive parties without potential supporters worrying that they’d inadvertently elect Trumpish figures; if the Greens, or any third party, are ever going to have a real breakthrough on a national level, it will be because people can vote for them without fear, real or imagined, of being a spoiler. But there’s another reason, too, which I got to see close up while covering elections as a young city-hall reporter in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which for decades was the only major city in the country to use R.C.V. It’s that these elections not only allow for more ideological diversity but also tend to reduce the truly hateful divisiveness that’s become such a feature of our elections. If you’re a candidate in a ranked-choice election, you have a strong incentive not to be a sneering jerk to your competitors, because that kind of behavior reduces your chances of getting crucial No. 2 votes. You have to make your case, and you have to at least understand someone else’s. Obviously, campaigning for R.C.V. is less sexy than campaigning for President, and it will take a little while (though the whole Green Party project seems premised on a kind of radical patience). If the Party insists on running a Presidential candidate in the few states where it really matters, I hope people will not waste their votes on them. That’s not because I think Joe Biden is a hero; it’s because I think he’s not only better than the alternative but also pushable. Politics doesn’t end on Election Day—if you’re serious about change, politics in some ways begins once the votes are counted, with the less exciting business of prodding politicians to keep promises or opening up the political space for them to do what they want. In that world, which is always the real world, the job is to elect a politician whom you have a chance of pushing, one who might take advantage of openings that movements can provide. So, for instance, I had no problem working hard to elect Barack Obama as President (and Joe Biden as Vice-President), and also no problem helping gather some of the largest demonstrations of their Administration outside the White House. We were pushing for Obama to keep his pledge to be a climate activist by opposing the construction of the Keystone Pipeline; he eventually came on board. That was a hugely important development in the fight against climate change—and it launched similar movements around the world. With Trump’s election, of course, that kind of opening ceased—there’s no point pushing someone who takes pride in destruction. Now, there’s a very real chance that the pipeline will be built. Magnify that scenario across all the issues of the day and you see why most climate activists I know just shake their heads at the thought of a third-party challenge this November. It took me a while to reach that point. In the first Presidential election I ever voted in, in 1980, I voted for Barry Commoner, of the Citizens Party (albeit in the safely blue state of Massachusetts). But the results of that and subsequent elections convinced me that Americans would do well to avoid third parties at the national level until our electoral structure shifts. That’s why, I think, Bernie Sanders has run for President as a Democrat and has always insisted that he would support the Party’s eventual nominee. As he told Biden on Monday afternoon, in his endorsement announcement, “I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every Independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy.” (He has also shown that you can change politics in dramatic ways from within the Democratic Party.) After Sanders lost in 2016 Democratic primary, I campaigned strenuously for Hillary Clinton across the swing states of the Midwest, and it was there that I began to worry that the Green Party was doing just well enough to threaten real trouble. So, that October, I wrote about the importance of voting for Clinton, even if she wasn’t your first choice. I don’t want to wait that long this time, and I know from reading the work of such long-standing Green activists as Ted Glick that there’s an active debate within the Green Party about the wisdom of competing in this year’s Presidential election. I hope it’s never necessary to write any take on this subject again. And not because the Greens or other idea-oriented parties disappear but because we rebuild our electoral system in easily doable ways that would allow for better elections.

,,Biden blasts ‘un-American’ voting limits; Texas Dems act," President Joe Biden delivers a speech on voting rights at the National Constitution Center, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)          PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Joe Biden declared preserving voting rights an urgent national “test of our time” on Tuesday but offered few concrete proposals to meet it. Texas Democrats took their own dramatic action to stymie Republican efforts to tighten ballot restrictions in their state. Biden, who has proclaimed protecting ballot access the central cause of his presidency, has faced sharp criticism from allies for not doing more, though political headwinds and stubborn Senate math have limited his ability to act. Despite his ringing words Tuesday, he avoided any mention of trying to alter the Senate filibuster rule that stands in the path of federal legislation. Speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Biden called state efforts to curtail voting accessibility “un-American” and “un-democratic” and launched a broadside against his predecessor, Donald Trump, who baselessly alleged misconduct in the 2020 election after his defeat. Biden called passage of congressional proposals to override new state voting restrictions and to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that were curbed in recent years by the Supreme Court “a national imperative.” Yet, instead of raising the possibility of fighting the filibuster, he appeared to tacitly acknowledge the fading hopes for the bills, saying he would launch a nationwide campaign to arm voters with information on rule changes and restrictions ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. “We have to prepare now,” the president said.  Biden’s sharp rhetoric drew praise from progressive groups in his party but did little to assuage the mounting pressure on him to throw his weight behind replacing the filibuster. “The president believes that we have to make the filibuster work the way it used to,” said White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who added Biden has not changed his opposition to eliminating it altogether. Biden’s remarks came a day after Texas Democrats decamped for Washington in an effort to deny their GOP-controlled Legislature the necessary quorum to pass a bill placing new restrictions on voting in the state. The lawmakers, who arrived in the nation’s capital Monday night, said they were prepared to stay in Washington — out of the reach of Texas law enforcement — until a special legislative session concludes early next month. Their action marks a dramatic new showdown over voting in America. Standing near the steps of the U.S. Capitol for a news conference ahead of a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats promised to “stay out and kill this bill.” However, state Rep. Chris Turner, the leader of the Texas Legislature’s House Democrats, said their efforts would ultimately be futile unless congressional Democrats take bolder action to overcome a Senate Republican blockade of the sweeping federal voting bill. The legislation, known as the For the People Act, would create national standards for voting that could roll back some of the restrictions that have been approved or are advancing in Republican-led states, including Texas. “We can’t hold this tide back forever. We’re buying some time. We need Congress and all of our federal leaders to use that time wisely,” Turner said. Several states have enacted new voting restrictions, and others are debating them, as the GOP has seized on Trump’s false claim of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election as a rationale for curtailing ballot access. “No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny, such high standards,” Biden said of the 2020 race. Some GOP-led states have worked to roll back the vote-by-mail expansion that was put in place in the past presidential election due to COVID-19 fears. Others have tried to strengthen voter identification requirements and curtail hours and locations for early voting and ballot drop-offs. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he would keep calling special sessions through next year if necessary to pass his state’s legislation, and raised the possibility of Democrats facing arrest upon returning home. Asked whether Biden thinks the Texas legislators are doing the right thing by leaving the state, Jean-Pierre said “he applauds their courage.” She said that in the administration’s view, the Texas bill is an “assault on democracy.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the administration’s efforts on voting rights, praised the Texas legislators during a meeting with them in Washington. “Defending the right of the American people to vote is as American as apple pie,” she told the lawmakers, comparing their actions to women’s suffrage and civil rights marches. Democrats on Capitol Hill have tried to respond with a sweeping federal voting and elections bill that Senate Republicans have united to block. Most Republicans have similarly dismissed a separate bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore sections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court has weakened. Those roadblocks have increased focus on Senate filibuster rules, which, if left in place, would seem to provide an insurmountable roadblock, requiring 60 votes in the evenly split, 100-member chamber to even bring up controversial legislation. Moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona also have so far expressed reluctance to changing the Senate rules. Many Democrats have expressed frustration with the lack of a greater White House push to change the filibuster, with civil rights activists stressing that Biden was elected with broad support from Black people whose votes are often put at risk by voting restrictions. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended Biden’s address, called it a “good speech,” but also said, “I told him that I was going to stay on him about the filibuster.” He described Biden as noncommittal on the issue. Biden, himself a veteran of the Senate, has offered some support for filibuster changes. But he has not put his full political weight behind the issue, believing it counterproductive in both the legislative and political fights over voting. He and Harris met last week with some of the civil rights leaders, who made clear that they expected a legislative solution. “Our backs are against the wall. This is the moment. We have no more time,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, after the meeting. “I told the president: We will not be able to litigate our way out of this threat to Black citizenship.” “Administrative action, litigation, and organizing are critical to combat this, but these tactics are not a substitute for congressional action on the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of the group Common Cause, said Tuesday. “As the president ramps up his use of the bully pulpit and engages with senators, we urge him to make clear that the Senate minority’s use of the filibuster—a Jim Crow relic, in the words of former President Obama—must never stand in the way of the freedom to vote.” Although not abandoning hope of legislative action, the West Wing has been shifting focus to other measures to protect voting, including legal remedies pursued by the Justice Department and action in individual states, according to officials. There also will be an emphasis on boosting voter turnout, with aides pointing to success Democrats had in getting out votes last year during the height of the pandemic. Officials concede, though, that turning out voters is always harder in a nonpresidential election year. —- AP writer Darlene Superville contributed from Washington.

,,Anti-Trump burnout: The resistance says it’s exhausted,"In 2017, they donned pink hats to march on Washington, registering their fury with Donald Trump by the hundreds of thousands. Then they flipped the House from Republican control, won the presidency and secured a surprisingly strong showing in the 2022 midterm elections, galvanized by their conviction that Trump and his allies constituted a national emergency. This year, anti-Trump voters are grappling with another powerful sentiment: exhaustion. “Some folks are burned out on outrage,” said Rebecca Lee Funk, the Washington-based founder of the Outrage, a progressive activism group and a purveyor of resistance-era apparel. “People are tired. I think last election we were desperate to get Trump out of office, and folks were willing to rally around that singular call to action. And this election feels different.” But for Democrats, the mission is similar: Now defending the White House, President Joe Biden is trying to reassemble that sprawling anti-Trump coalition, casting the 2024 contest as another battle to save American democracy as Trump moves toward the Republican nomination. Biden, however, has a lot of work to do. Interviews with nearly two dozen Democratic voters, activists and officials make clear his challenge in energizing Americans who are unenthusiastic about a likely 2020 rematch, are worried about his age and, in some cases, are struggling to sustain the searing anger toward Trump that Democrats have relied on for nearly a decade. “We’re kind of, like, crises-ed out,” said Shannon Caseber, 36, a security guard in Pittsburgh who called the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch a “dumpster fire.” She added, “It’s crisis fatigue, for sure.” Caseber, a Democrat who would back Biden over Trump, added, “Any sense of urgency that we had with the 2020 election — I think it’s still there in the sense that no one wants Trump to be president, at least for Democrats, but it’s exhausting.” Democrats are hardly alone in their political fatigue: A Pew Research Center survey last year found that 65% of Americans said they always or often felt exhausted when they thought about politics. “Exhaustion is underlying the entire attitude toward our presidential election,” said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster. “When you’ve got two people that are opposed by 70% of Americans who want a different choice, it creates frustration, anxiety and discouragement.” Democratic pollsters and strategists say that no one is more motivating or terrifying to their voters than Trump. Buoyed by strong showings in special elections last week, and other recent contests including a successful write-in campaign for Biden in New Hampshire’s primary, many believe their voters will grow increasingly engaged as the general election nears and Trump’s legal problems unfold. He confronts 91 felony charges across four cases, is poised to be the first former president to face a criminal trial and now has staggering financial problems. He has also privately expressed support for a 16-week national abortion ban, with some exceptions, The New York Times reported Friday, and Democrats see abortion rights as a powerful motivator for their base and for some swing voters. But there are pronounced warning signs on the left, as well. A CNN poll recently asked how motivated Americans were to vote in the election. Republicans, out of power and eager to regain it, were more likely to say “extremely motivated.” A Yahoo News/YouGov poll asked voters in the fall about their attitudes toward the 2024 election. For 39% of Democrats, “exhaustion” was the word they chose from the list of sentiments offered (a close second to “dread”). Just 26% of Republicans chose “exhaustion.” Broadly, surveys have shown erosion in the party’s standing with traditional Democratic constituencies. On the left, some groups have warned of funding challenges and voter apathy, and the most visible source of in-the-streets energy is progressive frustration with Biden over his support for Israel. Lauren Hitt, a spokesperson for Biden, said there was tangible evidence of enthusiasm in recent weeks, including on the fundraising front. She also signaled that the campaign’s messaging would go beyond simply opposing Trump, drawing contrasts with Republicans on abortion rights and gun safety as she described the stakes of the election and nodding to Biden’s policy accomplishments on issues such as combating climate change and child poverty. “This election determines whether we build on that progress or we lose so many of our fundamental freedoms,” she said in a statement. Many Democrats have argued the party must do more to press an affirmative case for Biden’s reelection, beyond just stopping Trump again. They also worry some voters could vote third party or sit out altogether this year. “They hear it every cycle: This is the most important election ever,” said Leah D. Daughtry, a Democratic strategist. While she considers Trump an “existential threat,” she said, “people want to vote for something and not necessarily against something.” Max Dower, founder of clothing line Unfortunate Portrait, recently designed a $78 shirt that reflected his sense of feeling “uninspired” about the election. It featured an image of Biden, 81, using a walker to fend off a cane-wielding Trump, 77, with the message, “Vote 2024.” He said it had drawn more engagement on social media than any design he had posted in roughly eight years (it also inevitably set off political battles in his Instagram comments). After years of feeling that the country was veering from one crisis to the next, Dower, who said he voted for Biden in 2020, suggested that he was burned out. “We’ve dealt with so many emergencies these past few years: national emergencies, perceived emergencies, real emergencies — it’s just kind of like, that is not really a strong motivator for me anymore,” said Dower, who is based in Los Angeles. He declined to say how he would vote this year but said he was unlikely to cast a ballot for Trump. “A lot of us would like a more positive thing to motivate us,” he said. “Not just purely, ‘Do this or else this bad thing is going to happen.’” Certainly, Trump is hardly a morning-in-America candidate. And while some have tuned him out since he left office, he will be unavoidable in an election year — reminding voters, Democrats hope, of everything they have long disliked about him. The former president, whose supporters attacked the Capitol to try to overturn the 2020 election, has encouraged political violence, spread conspiracy theories and preached a darkly nativist vision. He has sought to undermine American institutions and threatened to upend the international order, recently suggesting that he would encourage Russian aggression against American allies. “People are going to be more alert because Trump has become even more outrageous in his post-presidency,” Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, said in an interview last month. “It will be a challenge to make sure that people are aware of what he is doing because I think that sometimes he is so outrageous, so consistently, that there’s a danger that it can be normalized. But I do believe that the stakes will be so high in this election that people will, at the end of the day, understand that our democracy truly is at stake.” Democrats are also trying to put abortion rights on the ballot, literally and figuratively. The Biden campaign has already started advertising on the issue. Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the Indivisible Project, a progressive grassroots group, said her organization was supporting ballot measure efforts that would protect abortion rights in key states. She also argued that full Democratic control of Washington could lead to meaningful abortion protections nationally. “Burnout tends to be a function of a sense of powerlessness,” she said. “People are activated around getting our rights back.” That kind of message resonated with Dorothy Stevenson, 64, of Milwaukee. She did not vote for president in 2020, she said, alluding to Biden’s tough-on-crime record as a senator, saying she worried at that time that he was not “really for Black people.” Now, she said, she is unexcited by her choices but intends to support Biden because she believes the stakes of the election are higher. “It’s really, really, really, really because of the abortion issue — I think that they need to stay away from women’s bodies,” she said. The potential return of Trump, she said, is “a crisis.” Many Americans have been in denial about the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch. But as Trump moves closer to being renominated, some Democrats say their voters are beginning to grasp the significance of his return. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, a Biden campaign co-chair, said she “heard some fatigue and some concern” in the recent past. But after Trump won the New Hampshire primary, she said, “there has been a palpable shift. And it’s what I had hoped for. I hope we can sustain it and grow it.” In Washington, Funk of the Outrage suggested that to do so, some voters now “want to be reminded of what’s good about this country.” “It’s been a long slog,” she added, “for those of us in the movement.”  ",www.seattletimes.com,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/anti-trump-burnout-the-resistance-says-its-exhausted/,,

,,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus," Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively. Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest. To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.      u/baroquespoon (OP) has awarded 5 delta(s) in this post. All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in r/DeltaLog. Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended. Delta System Explained | Deltaboards So the issue here is the 3 positions you list at the end of your post. ""Accelerationism"" or parties being ""tge same"" is a popular strawman coming from a position of ignorance. The point, which can be discussed at length, is that centrists like Biden and their failures directly lead to far-right popularity. This phenomenon has been studied exhaustively. Now if you're talking exclusively voting strategy, the left does not subscribe to your theory of change. The left fundamentally wants to end the current system before the current system inevitably leads to catastrophe and understands that voting, or acting within the system, cannot work to that end. The left believes, and I think with good authority, that a figure like Trump is an inevitable product of the political and economic system as currently practiced and voting for a Biden does nothing to really solve that problem. You need to actually think this logic through more. So a person's character and actual decisions don't matter? Just as long as he's more left leaning than the other guy. Think about what this would mean for a conservative. Everytime you highlight something bad about Trump's personal life, or decision he's made that goes against the grain amongst conservatives, broken promises etc... that is all basically bullshit in your eyes. The only thing that matters is he's more right leaning than the other guy. Question: when we're talking about ""bad political calculus"" here, why is this framing explicitly around blaming voters for things they can't control? Maybe you consider this outside the scope of your view, but I don't really see the difference in spirit. You have a group of people saying, ""I don't want to vote for someone who does xyz,"" and the response is to berate them. Not to actually stop doing xyz. Not to run a candidate that isn't doing xyz. Just to continually tell them that they are evil and wrong If we expand this outside of ""the left,"" Biden's polling numbers are fucking awful with pretty much everyone except for anti-Trump republicans, who aren't going to vote for him anyway. We are a year out from the vote. Biden is, statistically, the worst person in the party (next to his VP), to run against Trump if you wan to win. Again, this is without ""the left."" Which continues to beg the question: who is the one making the ""bad political calculus"" here, really? ""The left"" generally believes that in a democracy, government power is derived from, and beholden to, the people. The idea that everyone has to just keep voting blue no matter what or who is antithetical to that idea I'm a right-wing person who will not vote for Trump. Is that bad political calculus? He's not yet the official nominee. If for some reason the nominee was someone else, that it would make sense to not vote for Biden. So the issue first, then the calculus. Biden is currently firmly in support of funding Israel and is in no way at all opposed to what the IDF is currently doing.
While I don't think Trump would have any more sympathy for Palestinians, I don't think he has any less sympathy either, once you hit the 'I literally don't care if you all die' point, you can't go lower.
Trump I also genuinely believe is actually less inclined to war with Iran or other countries than Biden would be.
Trump also personally hates Bibi Netanyahu. So if you're single issue voting, I would vote for Trump on that one issue. Now on the calculus itself, It's extremely clear what the democrats have been trying to do, They are essentially saying Option B is soooo bad that you MUST vote for Option A, and we REFUSE to negotiate or change any policies or anything on the Option A side. I think a valid response to that is to at the very least refuse to agree to vote for A. Make them do something, make them make some concession, make your vote conditional on changing policies to be something you want. The Democrats best case scenario right now would be for Biden to drop out entirely, refusing to vote for him would help accomplish that and you might get someone who could both beat Trump and have actual left leaning policies. In the longer term too though, if Biden does end up losing to Trump, you at least set the stage for the future.
When Clinton lost, they didn't learn any lessons, they blamed Bernie and Russians and Sexism all this stuff. With Biden there's gonna be no excuse, He will lose because he offered Nothing to anyone and was basically a Republican-lite. So then after the Trump Dictatorship ends upon his death in 2031 the dems might decide to stop trying to run Corporate Democrats in the next election.  To clarify, I have no issue with people threatening to not vote, as I think there is political calculus there. What I take issue with is the act of not voting itself, which is what I assume many people will happily follow through on. I want to understand their calculus at that juncture, not the threat beforehand. What is a threat that is not followed up on? Why would a left leaning person need to feel compelled to vote for a right wing candidate like Biden? I know Americans think that the Democrats are left wing but they're equivalent to European Christian democratic parties in policy. Biden's term has proven that he hasn't done anything significantly different to Trump. Children are still in cages, healthcare is still a luxury few can easily afford, they didn't codify Roe Vs Wade during the first two years where they had a majority in both Houses, they've increased the funding and arming of Israel and Saudi Arabia... need I go on? Unless the Democrats are forced to earn the votes of the Left, and those who feel there is no point to vote, then the cycle will continue. The lesser evil is not lesser if the only objective difference is rhetoric.  ",www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/,,
,,Fake 'Biden' robocall tells Democrats to stay home,"As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary, a robocall is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home - using a fake audio of US President Joe Biden. ""It's important that you save your vote for the November election ... voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says. The White House confirmed Monday that the call was not recorded by Biden and said the incident highlighted the challenges emerging technologies presented, especially before the November presidential election. ""The president has been clear that there are risks associated with deep fakes. Fake images and misinformation can be exacerbated by emerging technologies,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in Washington. New Hampshire Attorney-General John Formella announced he was investigating an apparent ""unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters"". Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was ""disinformation"" and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden's write-in campaign will be closely watched amid weak polls for the president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party's nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden's name is not on the ballot on Tuesday because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire's historical status and angering some Democrats there.

,,Election 2020: Biden holds slight leads in Nevada and Wisconsin as vote count slows to a trickle,"                                                                                                                    The coverage on this live blog has concluded. For the latest updates, results and coverage, visit CNBC’s latest live blog. Election Day has now carried over into Wednesday morning with no clear winner emerging yet in a tight contest. With polls now closed, President Donald Trump is projected to win Ohio, Florida and Texas, while former Vice President Joe Biden is ahead in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. The races in Georgia and North Carolina are too close to call as Trump holds slight leads. Attention is now turning to the industrial Midwest, but final results may not come for Michigan and Wisconsin until later Wednesday morning. Pennsylvania may not be called until later in the week. Biden, in an address to supporters in Delaware, urged patience as votes are counted and expressed confidence that he would ultimately prevail. As of 4:46 a.m. ET, Biden has picked up 224 electoral votes vs. 213 for Trump, according to NBC News projections. Despite Biden’s narrow lead, Trump tried to claim victory in an address to supporters, but millions of legally cast ballots are still being counted. NBC News has not made a call in the race. Republicans and Democrats are also battling for control of the Senate. Democrats flipped a seat in Colorado with John Hickenlooper’s victory over GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, while Republicans picked up a seat in Alabama with former college football coach Tommy Tuberville’s defeat of Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. The House of Representatives is projected by NBC News to remain under Democratic control. Here’s when states will start counting ballots. Here’s what you need to know so far: New Jersey, Montana, South Dakota and Arizona voters authorized the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, according to NBC News. South Dakota voters also moved to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. — Noah Higgins-Dunn Nevada said its next election result update wouldn’t come until 9 a.m. local time on Thursday. The elections division of Nevada’s secretary of state office shared on Twitter the breakdown of votes that have been counted so far and those that still need to be added to the tally. So far, Nevada has counted all in-person early votes, in-person Election Day votes and mail ballots through Nov. 2, the account tweeted. But mail ballots received on Election Day or over the next week will still need to be counted, as well as provisional ballots. It’s hard to estimate how many ballots are still outstanding, according to the officials, since the state sent mail ballots to every voter, though it doesn’t expect all of those ballots to be cast. Biden held a narrow lead as of Wednesday morning. — Lauren Feiner Biden leads in the Electoral College as of 5:35 a.m. ET Wednesday though votes in several close races are still being counted. Both candidates still need to gain several more states to reach an Electoral College majority of at least 270. —Lauren Feiner Democratic nominee Joe Biden has pulled ahead of President Donald Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to NBC News’ latest tally of votes. With 89% of the expected vote in, Biden has 1,575,490 votes, or 49.3%, compared to Trump’s 1,564,877 votes, or 49%. — Kevin Stankiewicz Joe Biden is projected to win Hawaii’s four electoral votes, according to NBC News. The Aloha State, which is the birthplace of former President Barack Obama, was widely expected to break for Biden over President Donald Trump. At the time that Hawaii was projected to fall in Biden’s column, the former vice president had amassed 224 electoral votes, compared with Trump’s 213. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump on Wednesday declared that he would “be going to the U.S. Supreme Court” as part of a fight over the outcome of the presidential election, saying “we want all voting to stop.”  “We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list,” Trump said from the White House. However, there are two issues with the president’s statements. First, Trump’s comments came more than an hour after the final U.S. polls closed in Alaska, so voting has indeed stopped, and there is no evidence that ballots are still being cast after the legal deadline. Rather, elections officials in states are counting and processing millions of legally cast votes. Secondly, it was not immediately clear what Trump meant by “going to the Supreme Court.” That is because the country’s high court typically reviews decisions made by lower courts. For example, in the 2000 election, there were numerous rulings made by lower courts over the Florida recount effort that were ultimately appealed up to the Supreme Court. Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign manager criticized Trump’s comments, but vowed to be ready to counter any legal action. “If the president makes good on his threat to go to court to try to prevent the proper tabulation of votes, we have legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort. And they will prevail,” Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a written statement Wednesday morning. — Kevin Stankiewicz, Christina Wilkie Joe Biden’s campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday morning that President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the counting of votes should stop was was “outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect.” “It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” Jen O’Malley Dillon said in the written statement. “The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted. Because that is what our laws — the laws that protect every Americans’ constitutional right to vote — require,” she added. Trump’s comments from the White House earlier Wednesday, in which he also falsely said he won the presidential election, came as millions of legally cast ballots have yet to be counted in the U.S. Elections. Officials in states across the country have warned that tallying the official vote this year could take longer than normal due in part to a surge of mail-in ballots this year. — Kevin Stankiewicz As of this moment in the race, Joe Biden has clinched 220 electoral votes, while President Donald Trump has secured 213 votes, according to NBC News projections. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House. NBC has yet to make calls in more than a half-dozen crucial states, and thousands of votes — including rafts of mail-in votes in some states and counties — have yet to be tallied up. Both candidates can envision various pathways to 270 votes, based on the states that have yet to be won. Trump, for example, could hit that target by scoring wins in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Biden is also hoping to win Pennsylvania — but pathways to the White House are still available to him if he loses the Keystone State and even Wisconsin. The former vice president could, for instance, win if he carries Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan — assuming he wins at least one vote from Maine, which is considered highly likely. Here are the states that are still too early, or too close, for NBC to call: — Kevin Breuninger Facebook
began alerting users early Wednesday that ballots are still being counted, after President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he had won the presidential election, even though millions of votes had yet to be counted. “Once President Trump began making premature claims of victory, we started running notifications on Facebook and Instagram that votes are still being counted and a winner is not projected,” Facebook said in a tweet. “We’re also automatically applying labels to both candidates’ posts with this information.”, NBC News has not yet projected the presidential election results.  The company in September announced that it would add a label to any post from a candidate or campaign that tries to declare victory before the final results are in. -- Jessica Bursztynsky Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County is suspending scanning mail-in ballots until 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, NBC News reported. Allegheny County spokesperson Amie Downs said in a statement that staff has been asked to report in at 10 a.m. to begin scanning “shortly after.” About half of the 348,485 mail-in and absentee ballots that have been returned have already been scanned and uploaded, according to Downs. Roughly 29,000 will be manually reviewed through the Return Board process. The remaining 146,537 will be scanned starting late morning Wednesday, according to Downs. All ballots are being stored in a warehouse with county police on patrol as well as 24-hour video surveillance, Downs said. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump addressed supporters early Wednesday from the White House and tried to claim victory in the presidential election, even as states across the U.S. continue to count millions of legally cast ballots. NBC News also has not made a call in the race. Trump described the continued tallying of votes, which has caused his advantage in states such as Georgia to dwindle, as “an embarrassment to our country.” However, it has widely been expected that it could take days for official election results, including in states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, due in part to the surge in mail-in voting this year. In his address, Trump also touted his performance in Texas, Ohio and Florida, which NBC News projects the president will win over Democratic nominee Joe Biden. — Kevin Stankiewicz Several key races in the fight for Senate control were unresolved early Wednesday. NBC News projects Republicans will hold at least 47 seats after the 2020 election. Democrats will have at least 46, including two independents who caucus with the party. Seven races were still undecided. They include the Arizona special election, which was too early to call as Democrat Mark Kelly led Republican Sen. Martha McSally. Elections in North Carolina and Georgia, where GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and David Perdue, respectively, defend their seats, were too close to call. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ reelection bid in Maine was too early to call. At least the GOP-controlled seat in Colorado and Democratic-held seat in Alabama are projected to flip. Republicans currently have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. — Jacob Pramuk With Joe Biden’s wins in Minnesota and Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, the Democratic presidential candidate picks up 11 electoral votes, NBC News projects. Biden has now secured 220 electoral votes while President Donald Trump has 213, according to NBC News projections as of 1:45 a.m. ET. —Hannah Miao Twitter
 has appended a warning over a tweet from President Donald Trump claiming that the opposition is trying to steal the election. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” the president’s tweet reads. Twitter attached a label over the tweet, reading “Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.” Facebook also flagged both posts on its platform, with separate messages on each. — Megan Graham Former Vice President Joe Biden will win Nebraska’s second congressional district, NBC News projects, flipping blue one electoral vote that President Donald Trump won in 2016. Nebraska and Maine are the only states that don’t play by the winner-take-all rules under the Electoral College. Instead, both have adopted laws that distribute their electoral votes in part by the statewide popular vote winner and in part by who gets more votes in each of their congressional districts. Nebraska has five electoral votes — four of which were projected by NBC to go to Trump. — Kevin Breuninger Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is projected to win Minnesota, according to NBC News. Minnesota is worth 10 electoral votes. The state has chosen Democratic presidential candidates for the last 11 elections. However, Trump only trailed Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by 1.5% in 2016. — Todd Haselton and Hannah Miao One of the last competitive Senate races on the 2020 election map may take a while to resolve. The Maine contest pitting Republican Sen. Susan Collins against Democratic state House Speaker Sara Gideon was too early to call early Wednesday, according to NBC News. Gideon’s campaign suggested it could take days to declare a winner. “It’s clear this race will not be called tonight and we are prepared to see it through to the finish,” campaign manager Amy Mesner said. “Over the coming days, we will make sure that every Mainer has their voice heard in this election.“

Collins projected confidence to her supporters on Tuesday night, saying that “with any luck at all, we’ll keep on going for Maine and for America.” If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the state’s ranked-choice voting system would kick in. If that happens, it could take days to decide the winner. — Jacob Pramuk President Donald Trump is projected to win Montana and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win Rhode Island, according to NBC News. Montana is worth three Electoral College votes and was expected to go to Trump, who won the state in 2016. Rhode Island is worth four electoral votes for Biden. —Todd Haselton President Donald Trump will win Texas, pocketing its haul of 38 electoral votes, according to NBC News projections. With more than 90% of the vote in, Trump led Democrat Joe Biden by about 6 percentage points, according to NBC News. Texas has long been a Republican stronghold, but some public opinion polls before the election showed a close race between Biden and Trump. The president won Texas by 9 points in 2016. Capturing its large batch of electoral votes this year is key for him to win a second term. — Kevin Stankiewicz With President Donald Trump’s projected win in Iowa, electoral vote shares currently stand at 205 votes for Democratic challenger Joe Biden and 171 for the president, according to NBC News projections. The electoral vote update as of 12:55 a.m. ET is still missing projections from key races, with final results for states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania not expected potentially for days after election night. —Hannah Miao Joe Biden told supporters early Wednesday he was “confident” he would capture Arizona and its 11 electoral votes, a state that President Donald Trump won in 2016. “We’re still in the game in Georgia, although that’s not one we expected, and we’re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan,” Biden added during his post-midnight address in Wilmington, Delaware. The races in Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan are still too early to call, according to NBC News. — Kevin Stankiewicz President Donald Trump is projected to win Iowa, according to NBC News. The state is worth six Electoral College votes. Trump won the election in Iowa in 2016 with 51.2% of the vote. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst will win Iowa’s Senate race, NBC News projected. The first-term senator faced a serious challenge from Democrat Theresa Greenfield, who had never held elected office.  — Todd Haselton and Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump sounded off on Twitter as Democrat Joe Biden took the stage to express his optimism about the presidential contest. Trump, in a series of tweets, claimed his campaign was up “BIG,” even as many ballots in key states were still being counted. He also announced that he would make a statement, presumably in person, sometime “tonight.” Trump corrected one of the tweets, which initially misspelled “polls.” Twitter quickly flagged that tweet with a warning label, which said Trump’s post “might be misleading about” the election. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” the tweet said. Earlier, Trump’s tweet spelled polls “Poles.” — Kevin Breuninger Democratic nominee Joe Biden said early Wednesday morning that he was confident he would defeat President Donald Trump in the presidential election, but urged patience as votes were counted across key Rust Belt states, Arizona and Georgia. “Look, we feel good about where we are. We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election,” Biden said as he spoke to supporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, it was going to take a while. We’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished.” — Kevin Stankiewicz President Donald Trump is projected to win battleground Florida’s 29 electoral votes, according to NBC News. The president won Florida by 1.2% in 2016. —Hannah Miao President Donald Trump is projected to win Idaho, according to NBC News. The state is worth four electoral votes. NBC News also projected Republican Jim Risch to win the U.S. Senate race in Idaho. — Megan Graham Biden is projected to win Virginia, picking up 13 electoral votes, according to NBC News. Hillary Clinton won Virginia in 2016. NBC projects Democrat Sen. Mark Warner will win reelection. — Todd Haselton An official call on the presidential race looks unlikely to come on election night as three critical states continue to tally their votes. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hold a combined 46 electoral votes, have been a target for Democrats to win after President Donald Trump narrowly carried the states in 2016. They carry almost a fifth of the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency. Many had expected Pennsylvania’s tally to come later than election night since officials are not allowed to open mailed ballots until Election Day. Officials in Michigan and Wisconsin warned that votes could continue to be tallied until early Wednesday morning or even that night. —Lauren Feiner Polls in Hawaii closed at midnight ET. The state, which Democrats have carried for nearly three decades, has four electoral votes. It’s the second-to-last poll to close, followed by Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump will win Ohio and its 18 electoral votes, according to projections from NBC News. With almost 90% of Ohio’s vote in, Trump leads Democratic nominee Joe Biden by about 8%, according to NBC News. Trump also carried the state in 2016 by 8% en route to his upset victory. The closely watched swing state has increasingly trended toward Republicans in recent years. -- Kevin Stankiewicz Both campaigns have turned their attention to the Midwest as President Donald Trump neared victory in Florida and North Carolina. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa are all still too close to call. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin may take days to count mail-in votes, making it unlikely a winner would be named on election night.

Michigan needs a full day before it reports its count, according to MSNBC. Seven of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties won’t count mail-in ballots until Wednesday, according to local officials. Philadelphia stopped counting mail-in ballots and will resume Wednesday. — Alex Sherman The U.S. dollar strengthened against China’s currency around 10:30 p.m. ET, with foreign exchange markets demanding more yuan for every greenback. The U.S. dollar hit a high of 6.7741 against the Chinese yuan, reaching its highest level since Oct. 2, when the dollar traded as high as 6.7776 against the yuan. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan is important given the large volume of trade between the two nations. The dollar had been falling versus the yuan in anticipation of a Biden win, traders said. — Thomas Franck Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham will hold onto his South Carolina U.S. Senate seat after a tough challenge from Democrat Jaime Harrison,, NBC News projected. Harrison, whose campaign focused in part on Graham’s loyalty to President Donald Trump raised a whopping $57 million in the third quarter, outpacing the incumbent senator. As Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Graham had pushed forward Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans voted to confirm Barrett late last month as voters across the country had already begun to cast early ballots in the 2020 election. In 2016, Graham opposed confirming then-President Barack Obama’s high court nominee, citing the election year, but this time he argued that the alignment of the president’s party and the GOP’s control of the Senate made the circumstances unique. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Wyoming and Mississippi, according to NBC News. Wyoming has three electoral votes, while Mississippi has six. Trump won both states in 2016 and was widely expected to carry them again this year. Republican Cynthia Lummis also will win the U.S. Senate race in Wyoming, according to NBC News projections. She previously represented the state in the House of Representatives. —Kevin Stankiewicz President Trump is projected to win three of the five electoral votes in Nebraska, according to NBC News. While most states award all of their electoral college votes to the winner of their popular vote, Nebraska and Maine are the two exceptions to this “winner-take-all” rule. — Todd Haselton and Tucker Higgins Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is projected to win California, Oregon and Washington, according to NBC News. With these three projected wins, Biden picks up 76 electoral votes. —Hannah Miao The mood is “great” in the White House’s East Room, where a couple of hundred people gathered to watch election results, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC’s Kayla Tausche. The gathering comes less than two months after the White House hosted guests at an event announcing Amy Coney Barrett as the Supreme Court nominee, which the nation’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci later labeled a “super-spreader event.” President Donald Trump and several other White House officials fell ill with the virus shortly after the event. —Lauren Feiner The following states will close their polls for the night at 11 p.m. ET. — Carmen Reinicke Democratic candidate Joe Biden is projected to win Illinois, according to NBC News. The state is worth 20 electoral votes. NBC News projected that incumbent Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin will win the U.S. Senate race in Illinois. — Megan Graham  U.S. equity futures traded in positive territory at around 10:30 p.m. ET with voting results pouring in from across the country. Contracts tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rose by 3%. S&P 500 futures gained 1.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 170 points, or 0.6%. In other markets, the price of U.S. bonds rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 0.855%. Bonds were lower earlier in the evening with the yield hitting a high of 0.945%. (Bond yields fall as their prices rise). U.S. oil futures gained 2.6%. — Thomas Franck President Donald Trump is projected to win Missouri, according to NBC News. The state is worth ten electoral votes. President Trump won Missouri in 2016 with 56.4% of the vote. — Todd Haselton Democratic nominee Joe Biden will win New Hampshire’s presidential contest, according to projections from NBC News. The state has four electoral votes. President Donald Trump lost the state in 2016 to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. — Kevin Stankiewicz President Donald Trump is projected to win Utah, according to NBC News. The state is worth six electoral votes. — Todd Haselton Democrats will keep their House majority, NBC News projects. While Democratic control of the House is confirmed, the party is looking to expand its majority in the chamber. Currently, Democrats hold 232 House seats. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans vie for control of the Senate. The GOP picked up a seat with Tommy Tuberville’s projected win in Alabama, while Democrats picked up a seat with John Hickenlooper’s projected win in Colorado, according to NBC News projections. —Hannah Miao Republican Tommy Tuberville is projected to win the Alabama U.S. Senate race against incumbent Democrat Doug Jones, according to NBC News. Jones won the seat narrowly in the 2017 special election. Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, was well known in Alabama and aligned himself closely with President Donald Trump. The GOP picked up a Senate seat with Tuberville’s projected win. Earlier, NBC News projected Democrat John Hickenlooper flipped the Republican-held Colorado Senate seat. —Hannah Miao President Donald Trump is projected to win Louisiana and Kansas, according to NBC News. Louisiana is worth eight electoral votes and Kansas is worth six electoral votes. — Todd Haselton President Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in Ohio, but the race is too early to call, according to NBC News. Trump won the Buckeye State and its 18 electoral votes in 2016. Biden holds the advantage in Arizona, but the contest also is too early to call, according to NBC News. The state, which Trump won in 2016, has 11 electoral votes. — Kevin Stankiewcz Democratic candidate Joe Biden is projected to win New Mexico, according to NBC News. The state is worth five Electoral College votes. New Mexico’s polls closed at at 9 p.m. ET. — Megan Graham  NBC News is projecting that New Jersey will legalize marijuana for recreational use. If legalized, it will allow people over age 21 to use, possess and buy marijuana in the state. — Todd Haselton The presidential contests in Iowa and Nevada are too early to call, according to NBC News, after polls in the states closed at 10 p.m. ET. President Donald Trump won Iowa in 2016, but lost Nevada in that election. Both states have six electoral votes. — Kevin Stankiewicz At 10 p.m. E.T., polls close in four more states, including battlegrounds Iowa and Nevada. President Donald Trump won Iowa, Montana and Utah in 2016. —Hannah Miao Colorado Senate nominee John Hickenlooper will defeat Republican incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner, NBC News projected, flipping the seat to Democratic control. Democrats need to gain four seats in the Senate to take control of the chamber. The victory of Hickenlooper, the former two-term governor, brings them one step closer to that goal. Gardner’s reelection bid had long been considered an uphill battle. Colorado has widely backed Democratic candidates in statewide races, including Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid for the White House and Michael Bennet’s Senate race that year. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race in South Carolina, according to the NBC News Decision Desk. South Carolina would give him nine electoral votes. — Todd Haselton President Donald Trump is projected to win Alabama, according to NBC News. Alabama will give him nine Electoral College votes.

South Dakota will give him three Electoral College votes. Polls closed at 7 p.m. local time. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., is projected by NBC News to have won his bid for reelection. — Todd Haselton Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas will win his reelection fight, NBC News projects. Cornyn, the powerful third-term senator and ally of President Donald Trump, was favored to defeat Democrat M.J. Hegar, an Air Force veteran and former House candidate. Cornyn sits on the Senate Finance, Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. — Kevin Breuninger The Arizona, Colorado and Michigan Senate races are too early to call, according to NBC News. The three contests will play a huge part in determining whether Republicans keep their 53-47 majority in the chamber. In Arizona’s special election, Republican Sen. Martha McSally faces Democratic former astronaut Mark Kelly. Colorado’s Republican Sen. Cory Gardner faces Democratic former Gov. John Hickenlooper. The Democrat is leading, according to NBC. Michigan is one of two states President Donald Trump won in 2016 where a Senate Democrat faces reelection. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters faces Republican Army veteran John James. — Jacob Pramuk President Donald Trump is projected to win Arkansas, according to NBC News. The state is worth six Electoral College votes and was expected to go to Trump. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is projected by NBC News to have won his bid for reelection. — Brian Schwartz Presidential election results in Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Minnesota, Michigan and Arizona remain too early to call, according to NBC News projections. Here’s how many electoral votes are on the line for President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden: Trump won Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and Arizona in 2016. —Hannah Miao Biden is projected to win the state of New York, picking up 29 electoral votes, according to NBC News. Polls closed in New York at 9 p.m. ET. —Steve Kovach Here are all the states closing at 9 p.m. ET and the electoral votes they each carry. There are 156 electoral votes in total up for grabs from the following states: — Steve Kovach President Donald Trump will win the West Virginia presidential race against former Vice President Joe Biden, NBC News projects. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia’s junior senator, is also projected to defeat her Democratic rival, according to NBC. Neither result was unexpected. Trump beat then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race by more than 40 percentage points in West Virginia, exit polls showed. Now, as in 2016, he is projected to walk away with the state’s five electoral votes. Capito was widely favored to defeat Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin. — Kevin Breuninger Arkansas is the only state closing polls for the night at 8:30 p.m. ET. The state has six electoral votes. — Jessica Dickler Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win Connecticut, according to the NBC News Decision desk. It will give him seven additional electoral votes. Hillary Clinton won the state in 2016. The polls closed at 8 p.m. ET. — Todd Haselton President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race in Tennessee, according to NBC News. Tennessee has 11 electoral votes, which Trump also won in 2016 with 61% of the vote. The last Democratic candidate to win the state was Bill Clinton, who won in both 1992 and 1996, according to NBC. Polls in Tennessee closed at 8 p.m. ET. — Carmen Reinicke Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will win reelection in Kentucky, NBC News projected. The Republican will defeat Democratic former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. While McGrath drew gobs of money as she took on the top Senate Republican, polls consistently showed her trailing McConnell in the red state. It only remains to be seen whether McConnell will lead a GOP in the Senate majority or minority in January. While he has distanced himself from Trump in some areas — particularly on both the White House’s handling of its coronavirus outbreak and on the size of a potential stimulus package — McConnell has found common ground with Trump on numerous critical issues. Most recently, he moved swiftly to confirm Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett before the election. — Jacob Pramuk The presidential race in Florida is too close to call and in Pennsylvania it’s too early, according to NBC News. Both states are key for both President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden as they battle it out for the White House on election night. The polls going into Election Day showed both candidates basically tied in those states. Florida and Pennsylvania combined are worth 49 Electoral College votes. — Brian Schwartz President Donald Trump is projected to win Kentucky’s eight electoral votes, according to NBC News. Polls showed Kentucky, the home of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was heavily favored for Trump over Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The Bluegrass State has voted for the GOP’s presidential candidate in every race since 2000. In the 2016 election, Trump won more than 62% of Kentucky’s electorate over Hillary Clinton. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race in Oklahoma, NBC News projects. Trump won the state’s seven electoral votes in 2016 as well, with 65% of the vote. Polls closed at 8 p.m. ET.
— Jessica Dickler The Senate races in Maine and Alabama, two of the most important in the fight for control of the chamber, are too early to call, according to NBC News. Polls showed the two states were among the most likely to flip party control entering Election Day. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is trying to defend her seat against Democratic state House Speaker Sara Gideon. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Doug Jones aims to hold off former college football coach Tommy Tuberville in Alabama, a red state. Republicans hope to hold their 53-47 majority in the Senate. — Jacob Pramuk Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win electoral votes in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the NBC News Decision Desk. Those four states would give him 38 electoral votes, adding to his projected win in Vermont with three electoral votes. The states each have the following number of electoral votes: —Lauren Feiner Election officials in Fulton County, Georgia, arrived at State Farm Arena on Tuesday morning to a burst pipe in the room above where absentee ballots are being scanned. While no ballots or machinery were damaged, the incident delayed officials’ ballot counting by about four hours, according to Fulton County spokesperson Regina Walker. Fulton County includes metro Atlanta and is the most populous county in Georgia. Walker told NBC News that county officials are pushing to complete vote tallies Tuesday night, though she did not give an estimated completion time. Georgia is considered a battleground state in 2020 with competitive presidential, Senate and House races. The incident was first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. —Hannah Miao The next round of states are closing their polls at 8 p.m. ET. -- Jessica Bursztynsky Senate races in Georgia and South Carolina remain too close to call, according to NBC News projections. Both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats are up for grabs in 2020. Republican Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff. Top candidates for the other open Georgia U.S. Senate seat are Republican Sen. Kelley Loeffler, Democrat Matt Lieberman, Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Doug Collins. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in either race, the top two finishers will compete in a critical January runoff election. In South Carolina, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison are competing for a Senate seat. These races could help help determine the majority party of the U.S. Senate following the 2020 election. Polls closed at 7 p.m. ET in both states. —Hannah Miao The presidential contests in the battleground states of North Carolina and Ohio are too close to project a winner, according to NBC News. In North Carolina, 15 Electoral College votes are at stake in the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Most of the more than 2,500 precinct polling places in the Tar Heel State were set to close at 7:30 p.m. ET, but four were granted deadline extensions of up to 45 minutes because of delays in opening Tuesday morning. Ohio has 18 electoral votes at stake. Polls were set to close at 7:30 p.m. ET in the Buckeye State. - Dan Mangan The Senate race in North Carolina is too early to call, according to NBC News. The election pits Republican Sen. Thom Tillis against Democratic former state Sen. Cal Cunningham. Polls entering Election Day showed a neck-and-neck contest for the seat. The race will play a major role in determining whether Republicans keep their 53-47 Senate majority. — Jacob Pramuk Former Vice President Joe Biden will win the presidential contest in Vermont, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ home state, NBC News projects. Biden was heavily favored to win the deep-blue Northeastern state’s three electoral votes. Vermont has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every race since 1992. Sanders, an independent and self-described democratic socialist, has served in the Senate since 2007. He ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries but became a surrogate for the nominee. — Kevin Breuninger The next round of states will close their polls at 7:30 p.m. ET. -- Jessica Bursztynsky President Donald Trump will win the presidential vote in Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence’s home state, NBC News projects. Polls entering Election Day showed the Republican incumbent heavily favored to carry the state. Trump will win Indiana’s 11 electoral votes, as he did in 2016. Pence was Indiana governor from 2013 to 2017 and a member of Indiana’s congressional delegation from 2001 to 2013. Federal election watchers will also keep an eye on the state’s 5th Congressional District, a suburban seat Republicans are trying to defend. — Jacob Pramuk The first round of states are about to close their polls for the night at 7 p.m. ET. — Jessica Bursztynsky Facebook
is notifying U.S. users they can still vote if they are already in line after polls close Tuesday. The company will show these notifications at the top of users’ Facebook and Instagram apps, a spokesman for the social media company said. The notifications will be shown to people of voting age as polls start to close in their states, and they’ll be shown nationwide on Instagram starting at 7 p.m. ET. The notifications will also direct users to election updates from the company’s voter information center, where they can get accurate election information. — Salvador Rodriguez A slim majority of voters nationwide want the Supreme Court to keep the Affordable Care Act as it is, according to NBC News exit polls. Fifty-three percent of voters would keep the 2010 health-care law as it is, and 42% percent would overturn it, according to a poll of early and Election Day voters. Low-income voters show the strongest support for Obamacare, according to the NBC poll. Sixty-one percent of voters with family income under $50,000 would keep the Affordable Care Act the same, compared with 44% of voters with family incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 and 55% with incomes over $100,000. Health-care policy was cited by voters as one of the most important issues in the 2018 midterm election but has been overtaken in the presidential election by the economy, coronavirus pandemic and racial injustice, according to NBC. About 11% of voters said health-care policy was the most important issue in deciding their vote. — Carmen Reinicke Votes in Georgia will be tallied by noon Wednesday “at the very latest,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told NBC News. Record early voting turnout will help the state count votes “faster than many other states,” Raffensperger said. Votes could be tallied as soon as Tuesday night, he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, Raffensperger’s office said lines to vote averaged just a two minute wait. Georgia awarded its 16 electoral votes to President Donald Trump in 2016 but is considered a close race this election. — Lauren Feiner U.S. stock futures rose about 10 minutes after the start of the extended trading as select polls in Kentucky and Indiana closed, marking the beginning of an overnight session expected to twist and turn depending on the election results. Dow futures were last seen up 150 points after at first opening little changed. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.5% and 0.35%, respectively. The positive move in futures came after stocks clinched yet another strong day of gains during Tuesday’s regular session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
 closed 554.98 points higher, or up 2.1%, at 27,480.03. Cyclical industrial and financials were the best-performing sectors in the S&P 500, gaining more than 2% each. The S&P 500
 climbed 1.8% to 3,369.16 and the Nasdaq Composite
 advanced 1.9% to 11,160.57. The Dow gained more than 400 points on Monday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively. — Thomas Franck Some polls in Kentucky and Indiana will close at 6 p.m. ET, before all locations in those states end voting an hour later. Thereafter, there will be a regular stream of poll closings usually every hour and sometimes every 30 minutes. The last polls, those in Alaska, close at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday. Both states are expected to vote to reelect President Donald Trump. Kentucky and Indiana are apportioned 8 and 11 votes in the Electoral College, respectively. Track the state-by-state poll schedule with CNBC’s tracker. – Thomas Franck More than half of voters nationwide said containing the coronavirus is more pressing than rebuilding the economy, according to NBC exit polls. Fifty-two percent of respondents said it was more important to contain Covid-19, even if it hurts the economy, according to the exit poll of early and Election Day voters nationwide. Forty-two percent of respondents said rebuilding the economy was the most important issue, even if it hurt efforts to contain the virus. The exit polls also outlined the most important issues for voters as they decided to cast their ballots. About a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue; 21% said racial injustice was the most important issue, while 18% said it was the Covid-19 outbreak. — Jessica Bursztynsky Democrat Joe Biden took a step back Tuesday afternoon to reflect on the presidential campaign that’s coming to an end. Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, after a full day of campaign stops in Pennsylvania, Biden said he had no regrets for how he ran the race. He also said he was superstitious about making predictions on Election Day. “I think we’re going to reestablish that blue wall” in the Midwest, he said. The former vice president also marveled at the expanded electoral map this year for Democrats, who are competitive across the Sun Belt for the first time in decades. “You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states were up for grabs,” Biden said. “The idea I’m in play in Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida? I mean, come on. Texas??” Biden was likewise sanguine about President Donald Trump, who reportedly may try to claim victory on Tuesday night before the votes are counted. Biden is scheduled to speak in Wilmington. “If there’s something to talk about tonight, I’ll talk about it,” he said. “If not I’ll wait till the votes are counted the next day.” — Christina Wilkie A federal judge ordered U.S. Postal Service inspectors to sweep mail processing facilities in 12 postal districts nationwide on Tuesday afternoon for ballots to ensure that they are delivered by voting deadlines. The order came on the heels of a new court filing by the Postal Service that showed the fifth consecutive day of fewer on-time ballot deliveries. The Postal Service said its processing score fell from roughly 91% to a new low on Monday of 89.59%, and the districts affected by the order have particularly low deliver ratings. The order, by Judge Emmet Sullivan in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., directed that Postal Service inspectors begin their sweeps no later than 12:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and to continue looking through 3 p.m. ET. The facilities subject to the order are central Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; Detroit; Colorado/Wyoming; Atlanta; Houston; Alabama; northern New England; greater South Carolina; South Florida; Lakeland, Florida; and Arizona. Sullivan also ordered that the Postal Service, by no later than 4:30 p.m. ET, “shall file a status update certifying compliance with this paragraph upon confirming, in the most efficient manner available, that sweeps were conducted and that no ballots were left behind.” Postal Service data reveals that around 300,000 ballots nationwide have been scanned after being accepted into the mail system without later scans showing their delivery. — Dan Mangan More than 100 million voters cast their ballots early in the 2020 election, according to data from the NBC News Decision Desk and TargetSmart, an analytics firm. That total more than doubles the number of early and absentee ballots cast in 2016 — about 46 million. The historic number was fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats were more likely to vote early or absentee, according to the data, though Republicans are counting on their voters to show up in larger numbers on Election Day. About 43% of early or absentee votes were cast by Democrats and about 37% were cast by Republicans. Women also cast more ballots early than men did. Women cast about 53% of early ballots and men cast about 44%, while the data does not include gender for the remaining voters. -- Tucker Higgins President Donald Trump is back at the White House and is scheduled to remain there through Election Day. The president will be briefed on the race throughout the day at the White House, a person close to the Trump campaign told NBC News. As election returns roll in Tuesday night, Trump will be in the Oval Office with family and top aides to monitor the results, NBC reported. A “war room” has also been set up in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, located next to the White House, according to NBC. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told NBC that the war room setup “needed to be in close proximity to the president and there is no expense whatsoever to American taxpayers for the use of a room in the EEOB, where events like prayer services and receptions for outside groups frequently occur.” “Every piece of equipment, including Wi-Fi and computers, was paid for by the campaign, and no White House staff is involved. The arrangement has been approved by White House counsel,” Murtaugh added. Multiple outlets reported that an election night party with hundreds of guests will be held in the East Room of the White House. Guests will be required to be tested for the coronavirus, according to NBC. — Kevin Breuninger The reporting of presidential election results from North Carolina will be delayed by at least 45 minutes due to voting deadline extensions being granted to four precincts that were unable to open on time Tuesday morning. One of them, the Plainview fire station in the town of Dunn in Sampson County, had its deadline extended to 8:15 p.m. — 45 minutes past the state’s Election Day deadline of 7:30 p.m. North Carolina does not report its voting tallies until all polling precincts are closed. North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. The state has 15 Electoral College votes at stake. Polls in in the state normally are open from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. ET. Precincts can have closing times extended if their openings are delayed by more than 15 minutes. The law allows an extension up to equal to the amount of time delayed. The state elections board voted at an emergency meeting to extend the closing times at two locations in Sampson County, one in Cabarrus County and one in Guilford County after hearing about computer issues and problems with printers that contributed to opening delays. In addition to the Plainview fire station precinct, other locations were extended by the amount of their delays, which ranged from 17 to the 34 minutes. People who vote after 7:30 p.m. at the four precincts will cast provisional ballots, officials said. – Dan Mangan and Hannah Miao Correction: This post has been updated to reflect the accurate revised closing time of the Plainview fire station precinct in Sampson County. President Trump expressed confidence in what he and his team are seeing so far in key states but signaled that the prospect of a Biden victory is on his mind. “Winning is easy. Losing is never easy. Not for me it’s not,” Trump told reporters at a Republican National Committee office in Arlington, Virginia. Most of the RNC staffers in view of the camera wore masks, while Trump and some of his officials in tow, including chief of staff Mark Meadows and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, did not. Trump, when asked, said he had not yet written either an acceptance speech or a concession speech. “I’m not thinking about concession speech or acceptance speech yet. Hopefully we’ll be only doing one of those two,” he said. The president touted the slew of large, in-person rallies he held in the days before the election, saying that his final push and his performance in the last debate against Joe Biden boosted his campaign. Asked how he was feeling, Trump acknowledged his voice was “a bit choppy” following the swing-state sweep. “God did not design it for that much,” he said. “We had some incredible rallies and incredible times, and I hear we’re doing very well in Florida and we’re doing very well in Arizona and incredible in Texas,” he said. “I’m looking at different locations and we’re seeing lines of people,” he added, “and they’re wearing a lot of red material, including hats.”
— Kevin Breuninger The New York City Police Department “is ready” to respond to potential demonstrations after the election and has advised local businesses to secure items outside their storefronts as a precaution, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We are not seeing any major demonstrations being planned at this moment,” de Blasio told New York City radio station 1010 Wins, encouraging people to demonstrate peacefully if they have concerns. “I think it will play out more as we see results, but the city’s ready, the NYPD is ready, and the most important thing here is that people need to participate in this election and then, obviously, respect the will of the people,” he said. Some New York City businesses in recent days have boarded up their storefront windows in case of post-election disorder, though de Blasio said the city didn’t advise them to do so. — Noah Higgins-Dunn First lady Melania Trump cast her ballot on Tuesday in Palm Beach, Fla., where photos and video showed that she was the only person in her polling station who was not wearing a mask. The first lady entered the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center at around 10 a.m., and waved and smiled to reporters. Trump contracted Covid-19 last month along with President Donald Trump and their son Barron, and since then she has remained largely out of the public eye in the White House. On Tuesday, the first lady said she was feeling “great.” Trump’s appearance in a public space without a mask is all but certain to draw criticism from public health experts, especially as the nation experiences a record surge in coronavirus cases. The president has repeatedly dismissed the importance of wearing masks, despite an overwhelming consensus among scientists that they prevent the spread of coronavirus. — Christina Wilkie WASHINGTON — The acting Department of Homeland Security secretary said Tuesday there was no indication that a “foreign actor” had compromised U.S. votes as the nation enters its final day in the 2020 presidential race. “We have no indications that a foreign actor has succeeded in compromising or manipulating any votes in this election,” Chad Wolf told reporters, adding that the results from the election may take a few days. “It is important to recognize this process may require time,” Wolf said referencing the Covid-19 pandemic and the influx of mail-in votes. Alongside Wolf, DHS official Christopher Krebs said that while he had seen some indications of disruption, the U.S. election systems proved to be resilient. Top U.S. government officials, as well as leaders of the intelligence community, have previously flagged attempts by Russia, China, and Iran to influence the U.S. election. — Amanda Macias President Donald Trump departed the White House for a visit to the Republican National Committee Annex in Arlington, Virginia, more than an hour after he was scheduled to roll out. Trump was originally set to exit the White House at 9:45 a.m., but on Tuesday morning that departure time was updated to 11 a.m. The president was not seen walking out of the White House residence until 12:03 p.m., according to the White House press pool. The White House declined CNBC’s request for more information on the president’s schedule. Trump had traveled extensively on Monday, flying to four key swing states and delivering long speeches at five campaign rallies — the last of which ended after 1 a.m. Tuesday morning. On Election Day morning, Trump called into Fox News, where he said he planned to declare victory “when there’s victory, if there’s victory.” — Kevin Breuninger A dark money organization has quietly spent nearly half a million dollars on ads against President Donald Trump in the buildup to Election Day. The ad spending spree came from a group called A Healthy Future, which has spent over $400,000 on Google, YouTube and Facebook ads in at least the past 10 days. The group is taking aim at Trump’s executive order intended to lower prescription drug prices. The order was signed by the president in September. One of the ads argues that the executive order could impact the development and pricing of an eventual coronavirus vaccine. “America needs a cure for Covid-19 now and innovative biopharmaceutical companies are rising to the challenge. So why is President Trump risking American lives with dangerous executive orders?” the voiceover in the ad says. NBC News’ Decision Desk will make calls on races tonight and beyond. CNBC will bring those calls to you on the air, as well as on this blog and our homepage. For a guide on how NBC decides to call races, go here. – Mike Calia Election Day voting in five key battleground states got off to a mostly smooth start on Tuesday, according to monitors affiliated with the national nonpartisan democracy group Common Cause. State leaders for the group in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia reported that voting was proceeding with little sign of systemic problems on a briefing held around 10 a.m. ET. Suzanne Almeida, interim director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, said that despite Covid-19 it was “almost a regular Election Day in Pennsylvania thus far,” though she said that the state faced many long lines, particularly in communities of color. Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, also reported long lines but few signs of systemic trouble. “All in all, a pretty good report from North Carolina,” said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina. “No major machine problems, no long lines, no Covid issues. All good things. A few precincts did not open on time.” Liza McClenaghan, chair of the Common Cause Florida governing board, said the group had received 500 “mostly generic” inquiries. Despite traffic issues and some trouble with electronic poll books that were programmed incorrectly in Lake County, “it’s going smoothly at the moment in Florida,” she said. Aunna Dennis, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said that some precincts in the state’s Fulton County did not originally receive some necessary supplies, but that more supplies were eventually sent. She said that in several precincts there were problems with the electronic voting software because of an update from the state sent Monday evening, and that the group was working to determine whether the issue was occurring statewide. “There are technology procedures in place to work with those types of issues,” she said. – Tucker Higgins The U.S. Postal Service on Election Day reported its fifth consecutive day of fewer on-time ballot deliveries, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The Postal Service said its processing score fell from roughly 91% to a new low on Monday of 89.59%. The Postal Service has been under fire since Trump-appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy took over the reins of the government agency in May, 2020. Before policy changes implemented on his watch, on-time delivery rates were around 95%. There are 28 states that will not accept ballots that arrive after Election Day, even if they are postmarked before Nov. 3rd. On Nov. 1, a judge ordered the agency to remind senior managers they must follow its “extraordinary measures” policy and use its Express Mail Network to expedite ballots ahead of Tuesday’s presidential election. – Valerie Block Former FBI Director James Comey is talking again, and a lot of people are not happy about it. Again. Comey, whose controversial letter to Congress about Hillary Clinton in October 2016 is widely blamed for contributing to her defeat that year, tweeted his support of current Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday. “Vote for your country,” Comey wrote in his Twitter post, which contained a photo of him raising a Biden/Harris coffee mug, while wearing a Biden/Harris 2020 t-shirt with the words “Truth,” “Hope,” and “Decency.” Comey promptly received a barrage of scathing replies from people who either still blame him for Clinton’s loss, or for what they consider a baseless “hoax” of an FBI investigation into President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and its ties to Russians. Trump’s firing of Comey as FBI director in 2017 led directly to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to continue that probe. Comey on Oct. 28, 2016, sent Congress a letter saying the FBI had learned about the existence of emails that appeared pertinent into an investigation into the use of a private email server while Clinton was secretary of State under President Barack Obama. That letter came less than two weeks before Election Day, and rocked Clinton’s campaign. Comey months earlier had infuriated Clinton supporters, as well as backers of Trump’s campaign, for a long-winded news conference about that same probe in which he said both that “no reasonable prosecutor” would lodge charges against Clinton in the case, while saying at the same time “there is evidence of potential violations of” laws about the handling of classified information. The political data news site FiveThirtyEight in 2017 said that the disclosure of Comey’s letter to Congress, “at a maximum ... might have shifted the race by 3 or 4 percentage points toward Donald Trump, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida to him, perhaps along with North Carolina and Arizona.” “At a minimum, its impact might have been only a percentage point or so. Still, because Clinton lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by less than 1 point, the letter was probably enough to change the outcome of the Electoral College,” the site’s founder, Nate Silver, wrote. –Dan Mangan Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden took two of his granddaughters to see his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Tuesday morning, part of a series of informal Election Day campaign stops in the battleground state. Biden said his two granddaughters, Finnegan and Natalie, had never seen his childhood home, so he wanted to show them. Outside the modest house, supporters filled the streets, chanting and cheering. While he was in the house, Biden wrote a short prayer on the wall: “From this house to the White House with the grace of God.” It was the second time he had written on the wall there, the first time was during Biden’s successful campaign as President Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008. Pool reporter Alexi McCammond tweeted photos of the prayer. ---Christina Wilkie Twenty-one states — including the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — on Monday hit record highs in the number of average daily new coronavirus cases reported, Johns Hopkins University data show. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed at least 231,566 people in the U.S., has been a defining issue in the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden. But while the crisis has formed the cornerstone of Biden’s closing argument, Trump has shifted his focus elsewhere in the final days of the race. Trump has long downplayed the virus, and in a spate of lengthy campaign speeches Monday spent relatively little time discussing the pandemic, even as experts in his own administration warn that the U.S. could be on the cusp of the most dangerous period yet. Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly said in a leaked memo dated Monday that the U.S. is entering “the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic.” On Monday, Trump repeated his claim that the recent increase in cases is due to an increase in testing. Experts, including Trump administration officials, dispute that assertion. Some states, such as Ohio, where Joe Biden visited on Election Day eve, have also hit new peaks in hospitalizations. — Kevin Breuninger Democratic nominee Joe Biden stopped by a canvass kickoff event in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday morning, the first of several informal stops he plans to make throughout the day. Biden arrived at the Carpenters Local Union Hall 445 shortly after 9 a.m. ET, where about 60 supporters, including Pennsylvania’s senior Sen. Bob Casey, were waiting to welcome him. Biden noted that he scored his first unanimous victory last night – with 5 out of 5 votes cast – in tiny Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, which traditionally votes for president just after midnight on Election Day. “So based on Trump’s notion, I’m gonna declare victory right now,” Biden joked, poking fun at President Donald Trump, who reportedly may try to claim victory on Tuesday night before all the votes are counted. Biden then gave a shorter version of his stump speech, telling the crowd through a handheld megaphone that he ran for president to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the middle class and to unite the country. –Christina Wilkie With Election Day under way, millions now await the results of the all-important presidential race and the composition of the U.S. Senate. CNBC posted a schedule of when each state’s polls close and how many electoral votes each state is allotted so voters can keep track of results on Election Night. Results by state tend to trickle in in the hours immediately following poll closure. The first states to close their polls are Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, where voting concludes at 7 p.m. ET. Most of Florida’s polls close at 7 p.m., while the panhandle will close at 8 p.m. The last state to close its polls is Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. Here are when battleground state polls close and their electoral votes: —Thomas Franck The narrow Republican majority in the Senate is in play on Election Day. Whether it stays Republican or flips Democratic could determine the size of any additional coronavirus stimulus package, which has remained elusive for months. The Republican Senate has been pushing for less than a quarter of the $2.2 trillion package passed last month in the Democratic-controlled House. The White House has generally been offering something in the middle. Talks to try to get more stimulus before the election between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had showed glimmers of promise but ultimately failed. — Matthew J. Belvedere The presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and key Senate races aren’t the only outcomes to watch today and the days to come. Here’s a list of ballot propositions across the country that NBC News will be tracking: —Hannah Miao Don’t get too excited about the early vote tallies this election night, warned David Wasserman, the House editor for the Cook Political Report and an NBC News contributor. While Americans are used to having a pretty good idea of where votes stand on election night, Wasserman said the large numbers of mailed and early votes this year could skew initial results. That’s because more Democrats than Republicans are expected to vote by mail or early as opposed to on Election Day and states have varying rules about when election officials can begin counting different types of ballots. In states like Florida, North Carolina and Texas, for example, mailed and early votes will likely be reported first, according to Wasserman, and could favor Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Wasserman said this “blue mirage” could be “erased” or diminished once Election Day votes are tallied. On the flip side, in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a “red mirage” may appear to show President Donald Trump taking the lead initially because those states bar election officials from counting early and mailed ballots until either the day of or day before Election Day. Such a lead could be narrowed or overtaken once all those mailed and early ballots are counted. —Lauren Feiner North Carolina, Florida and Ohio will be key to victory for President Donald Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Republican pollster and political strategist Frank Luntz told CNBC. “If Donald Trump wins all three of them, he’s going to be in this,” Luntz said on “Squawk Box.” “If Biden wins even one of those three, it’s Biden’s presidency.” The three states all began processing mail ballots before Election Day and expect to have results by Wednesday morning, therefore offering an early look at each candidate’s prospects. Luntz said if the president can win all three states, the election outcome may hinge on the results in Pennsylvania, which may take some time. The state did not start processing ballots until 7 a.m. Tuesday and cannot begin counting ballots until polls close on Election Day. Trump won North Carolina, Florida and Ohio in 2016. —Hannah Miao Some airline crews will lodge at airport hotels and avoid downtown accommodations just in case there are protests and unrest during and following Election Day. United Airlines pilots with layovers in seven cities this week, including Washington, Chicago, Portland, Oregon and Philadelphia, will stay close to the airport “out of an abundance of caution,” the pilots’ union told members. “In order to prevent any potential delays of our crewmembers getting to where they need to be on time, we have relocated some of our crews to airport hotels,” a United Airlines
spokesman said in a statement. United and Alaska Airlines
flight attendants will also change to airport hotels away from some city centers, according to the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, their union. Airlines regularly switch crews’ hotels during special events, demonstrations, natural disasters and other issues, but the move tied to an election is unusual, according to unions. “We are closely monitoring the situation and will make adjustments as needed,” an American Airlines
spokesman said in a statement. “The safety of our team members is our highest priority.” The Allied Pilots Association, the union of American’s roughly 14,000 pilots, told members to “exercise increased vigilance with regard to personal security during the coming days, as election-related unrest may occur.” The union told pilots to avoid large groups, protests and going out alone. Delta Air Lines
said it can change crew hotels when warranted but declined to provide specifics “out of many safety and security considerations.” — Leslie Josephs Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden began Election Day by attending Mass at St. Joseph of the Brandywine Catholic church in Wilmington, Delaware. Following services, the Biden family visited the burial plot of Biden’s elder son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Joe Biden has often said that Beau’s encouragement was a major factor in his decision to run for president. Also buried at the cemetery are Biden’s first wife and his daughter, who were both killed in a car accident in 1972. Biden was joined by his wife, Jill Biden, and by two of their granddaughters.

Against CDC guidelines and health experts’ urgings, the DNC and Joe Biden’s campaign urged Americans to vote earlier this month — undoubtedly spreading coronavirus further. But don’t expect any accountability for it, from mainstream media or anyone else.

Drew Angerer / Getty Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Donald Trump is the single individual in US society most responsible for spreading dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 in the midst of a global pandemic. Anyone who echoes him, or his administration’s entreaties to not take going out in public too seriously, is engaging in public endangerment. Anyone who actively encourages people to gather in mass, and in close proximity, is doing so at a mass scale. So why, in contravention of Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and health experts’ urgings, did the DNC and Joe Biden’s campaign do just that at immense scale earlier this month, as major cities were already closing public spaces? And why have media that have deservedly taken Trump and his administration to task for their fatal failures not done the same with Democratic leadership? If a senior adviser to President Donald Trump falsely claimed on national television that the CDC had declared that it was safe to vote in person, despite its actual recommendation to the contrary, the adviser and the president would be rightly condemned by much of corporate media as, at best, incompetent and ignorant, and, at worst, dishonest and reckless in encouraging people to put their lives at risk. And if poll workers had contracted COVID-19 at locations which violated CDC recommendations, the adviser and the president would be rightly blamed for exposing them to the virus. Yet after the CDC on March 15 advised the public to cancel all gatherings of more than fifty people, a senior adviser to Joe Biden, the current frontrunning Democratic presidential candidate, went on CNN and claimed the CDC had deemed in-person voting safe. And not a single major media outlet reported on it. Nor did they report on the actual dangerous conditions at multiple primary voting sites, and the exposure of trusting citizens to the coronavirus that the adviser’s reckless advice had encouraged. And it wasn’t just one irresponsible adviser that put people at risk: DNC chair Tom Perez made misleading statements, downplayed the dangers and exaggerated the preparedness of voting sites, and criticized and threatened states which wanted to postpone their primaries. The Biden campaign as well as the DNC put politics over people, exposing countless voters to a fatal virus. We now know that at least two poll workers at locations described as safe by Perez and the Biden campaign have contracted COVID-19. It’s unknown how many more poll workers, voters, and the people they came into contact with will also contract the virus. Senior Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders made the dishonest statements during a post-debate interview on Sunday night, March 15. This was hours after the CDC released a statement (3/15/20) that advised canceling all gatherings of fifty or more people. The CDC advisory was mentioned at the very beginning of the debate, and also during Anderson Cooper’s post-debate interview with Bernie Sanders. When Cooper asked the Vermont senator, “Should there be a primary on Tuesday” in light of the CDC’s recommendation, Bernie Sanders responded: That is a very good question, and as you know, Louisiana and Georgia and Puerto Rico have delayed their elections. Postponed them, they’ve got dates in the future. Look, election dates are very, very important. We don’t want to be getting into the habit of messing around with them. But you remember, and I just researched this, 9/11, you know there was a primary in New York City…. And it was canceled, for obvious reasons, in New York City, and it was rescheduled two weeks later. I would hope the governors listen to the public health experts, and they’re saying … we don’t want gatherings of fifty or more people. And when I think about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people and all that, does that make a lot of sense? I’m not sure that it does. CNN’s Chris Cuomo referred to the CDC update, as well as to Bernie Sanders’s response to it during his interview with Symone Sanders, asking her: CDC says no groupings bigger than fifty, that’s like every polling station except in very small counties. The idea of delaying primaries, Senator Sanders seemed comfortable with that; we should listen to what the CDC says. We should delay the primaries if we have to. What are your concerns? Unlike Bernie Sanders, however, Symone Sanders’s chief concern seemed to be making sure that the primaries were not postponed: Our democracy is extremely important. Even in times of strife in this country, we have to do our duty. So the CDC and folks have said it’s safe out there for Tuesday. So I don’t know what Senator Sanders was talking about…. So I encourage people to get out there and vote on Tuesday. Symone Sanders openly stated that Bernie Sanders’s public health concern was unfounded, even though Bernie Sanders had cited the CDC’s recommendation that gatherings of fifty people or more were unsafe — which, as Cuomo pointed out, would include voting at almost every polling station. Yet Biden’s senior adviser asserted that the CDC had assured the public that the elections were safe, urging people to vote based on a false promise of safety. While Bernie Sanders had mentioned that some states had already postponed their primaries, and hoped that other governors would follow the CDC guidelines, Symone Sanders pointed to the governors who had not: Governors across the country, Ohio, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, they have said that they feel comfortable, and are confident that not only will the elections be safe, but that they can carry them out. So I am looking to these governors … to abide by the CDC guidance, and if they say that they can administer this process, we believe them. She went on to name one governor in particular: “Governor DeWine said it was safe in Ohio, so I encourage people to get out there and vote on Tuesday.” Notably, the Republican governor she singled out would announce less than twenty-four hours later, “We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in-person voting for thirteen hours tomorrow, and conform to [CDC] guidelines,” and recommend moving the primaries to June. By the end of the day, Ohio’s health director Dr Amy Acton ordered the polls closed as a health emergency. Symone Sanders found herself on the same side as Florida’s Republican governor Rick DeSantis, who has been roundly condemned for his slow and insufficient response to the virus, including his initial refusal to close beaches. (DeSantis is also known for urging Floridians to not “monkey this up” by voting for his opponent for governor, Andrew Gillum, who happens to be African-American.) Symone Sanders and DeSantis even made similar points to justify voting on Tuesday. DeSantis told reporters, “We’re definitely voting. They voted during the Civil War. We are going to vote.” Sanders told Cuomo: In times of war, in times of strife, our country has always upheld our need to uphold our democracy. We have voted in wartime; votes were held many times in this country after times of strife …. So I just encourage folks to use your voice, your vote is your voice, and our democracy is extremely important even in times of strife in this country; we have to do our duty. Neither DeSantis nor Sanders pointed to a historical precedent for voting during a major pandemic. While Sanders’s lie was egregious, DNC chair Tom Perez showed a similar reckless disregard for public health. Not only did he urge people to vote, ignoring CDC guidelines, but he threatened to punish states for trying to comply with them. When Perez appeared on MSNBC’s All In With Chris Hayes show on Monday night, the host asked the DNC chair to comment on an Ohio judge’s rejection of the governor’s request to postpone the primary: It is your view that this can be safely conducted tomorrow? Who have you been consulting to come to that view? Your position as Tom Perez, the head of the DNC, my understanding is you are saying you agree with the states that are going forward? Perez responded: We respect what they’re doing …. And I was in contact today with people in a number of these states, including but not limited to Arizona. And, again, asking them if, do they believe they have the systems in place that enable them to put the elections on tomorrow? And they do. And Republican and Democratic governors have made that judgment that they can do that. I don’t think it’s for me to second-guess those judgments, Chris. Less than twenty-four hours later, however, when Ohio’s health director ordered polling locations to be shut down, Perez was all too happy to second-guess the judgment of not only the Ohio governor, but the health director, who happens to be a physician with an MD and a master’s in public health; the first and only woman to hold this position; and, by the way, a former Obama volunteer. In a statement, Perez blasted the postponement: What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion, and the Democratic Party leadership in Ohio is working tirelessly to protect the right to vote. Eligible voters deserve certainty, safety and accessibility. He discouraged other states from moving their primaries: That’s why states that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable. Those were public statements, but an internal DNC memo sent to members of the Rules and Bylaws Committee on Wednesday night, and obtained by the Guardian), went further, threatening to punish states that moved their primary beyond a cut-off date of June 9 by reducing their number of delegates by half. (Louisiana and Kentucky scheduled their elections to take place on June 23.) It’s hard to reconcile Perez’s statement that the “timing around the virus remains unpredictable” with a firm cut-off date. The head of a party that is positioning itself as the science- and reason-embracing alternative to the Republicans ignored the advice, recommendations, and pleas of trained experts. “Deeply disappointed that the DNC is willfully choosing not to listen to scientists during one of the most critical moments in recent history,” tweeted molecular biologist and March For Science organizer Lucky Tran. Over 2,500 people, including over 100 doctors, scientists, and public health professionals, signed an open letter to “Extend Mail-in Voting and Reschedule March Primaries Amid Pandemic”: We have seen long lines of voters in states like Texas and Michigan. The amount of time standing in line with hundreds or even thousands of other voters substantially increases the likelihood that someone will get sick. By postponing primaries, state governments will be able to keep resources focused, and they will not need to worry about the distraction of running primaries while responding to this pandemic. This will also give time for the states to implement alternative voting mechanisms, such as vote-by-mail, at a sufficient scale if the pandemic continues to be an emergency for these states. Furthermore, polling place workers, who are generally retired volunteers over 65 years old, should not need to be exposed to the risk of contracting the coronavirus while managing precinct locations. The letter also clarified: We do not believe that a public health crisis or a state of emergency should ever be used as an excuse to cancel elections. The Democratic primary season concludes in early June; the party has full flexibility to schedule state-level races at any point before then. The conditions found at polling stations were exactly what the people who signed the letter, the Governor of Ohio, the director of health, and everyone who urged the Democratic Party to put human life over political expediency feared. Bernie Sanders coordinator Abshir Omar spoke to me on my podcast about the violations of CDC guidelines he observed and documented on video and through photographs. “Thousands of people were put at risk and possibly exposed to deadly pathogens,” Omar said: The CDC put out guidelines to the election board to try to conduct safe elections: have six-foot spacing, wipe down all voting equipment after each use. And out of all the voting locations that I visited — I visited nearly fifteen sites —not a single voting location was in compliance with the CDC’s health advisory for this election. Not a single site. Reasonable health accommodations are not being made. At the Thurgood Marshall Library, in a predominantly African-American senior community, people were sitting shoulder to shoulder in this lobby for two and a half hours. At an early voting site in Gage Park, Illinois’ second-largest Latino district, Omar said, “In the basement of an unventilated building, I saw 200-plus people standing in hallways less than a foot apart from each other.” What happened was a clear and present danger to the folks in the country. What I saw was thousands of people coming out to vote, and, sadly, some of these people will die. Omar spoke to a voter volunteer who explained that the elections supplies never arrived, so they had to turn away voters and send them to an overcrowded “super polling place.” Omar also spoke to Deborah Colins, who was standing outside of the Thurgood Marshall Library, who said: There are senior citizens sitting in there, they’ve been there two or three hours waiting. There are too many people smashed together in there. It’s too close in there … I’ve been standing out here hours myself. Too many people in there. None of the seniors citizens are being waited on they’re just sitting there and waiting. And a lot of people are leaving, they’re not voting because they’re having to wait so long …. Something is wrong, somebody needs to do something. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker did something, but not until it was too late. On Friday, three days after he insisted it was safe to vote, the governor issued a stay-at-home order after consulting with “some of the best medical experts, epidemiologists, mathematicians and modelers” in the country. Three days earlier, he couldn’t be bothered to listen to CDC guidelines. Pritzker’s order bans gatherings of more than ten people, yet three days before, he allowed for gatherings of hundreds of people at polling stations. All of this seems incredibly newsworthy and urgent. Yet, despite the preponderance of documentary evidence, to my knowledge, the only published piece on the CDC violations that occurred at polling sites was by Jake Johnson in Common Dreams. The only outlets we saw writing about the comments made by Symone Sanders were Paste magazine and the Intercept. The Young Turks’ Emma Vigland discussed Symone Sanders’s quote in a video. Neither the New York Times nor the Washington Post has said anything about what should be front-page news. Neither CNN’s Chris Cuomo nor MSNBC’s Chris Hayes did any follow-up reporting on the questions they posed to their guests. When CNN’s Jake Tapper interviewed Pritzker about his tough decision, he didn’t ask the governor about his earlier decision to go forward with the primaries. To his credit, MSNBC fill-in host David Gura asked Chicago Mayor Lori Lighthouse if she had “any second thoughts about Illinois continuing with that in-person voting … just a few days ago? I know hindsight is 20/20, but you did have folks going to the poll across the state of Illinois this week.” The mayor responded that “hindsight is 20/20,” but claimed the Board of Elections did a good job to make sure that all the voting machines and the areas in which people voted were sanitized and that social distancing was in place. Very tough circumstances to hold an election. But we got through it. They got through it by having people closer to each other, failing to provide precincts with voting supplies, and failing to wipe down pens or voting machines. But MSNBC’s star anchor Rachel Maddow did not question the wisdom of Tuesday’s primaries. Unlike Chris Hayes, she did not question Tom Perez’s position on the elections. Instead, she put the blame on Bernie Sanders: One of the things that is a really serious public health consideration is what is going to happen with these primaries that are being held throughout the country. And if one of the two remaining candidates in the race has what amounts to a de facto insurmountable lead, if the race is going to continue all the way until the convention because the guy who is never going to catch up just wants to stay in the race just because he’s got his reasons of his own, it has a different weight now …. Because these primaries are only gonna continue to happen because Senator Sanders is going to stay in the race …. So it will be his decision that forces these very difficult health decisions on all of these states. Brian Williams chimed in: “You’re so right to say that.” But Maddow was not “so right.” While Williams might not be aware of this, Maddow, a Rhodes scholar and self-described political “geek,” surely knows full well that our primaries are not just for candidates running for president, but for thousands of people running for Congress, mayor, governor, and countless other local offices. In other words, these primaries are going to occur independently of the presidential race, barring some nationwide cancellation of democracy. Should all candidates in all races drop out if their opponents are leading in polls? You don’t have to cancel democracy because it’s hard to have safe elections; you find safe ways for people to take part. And if Maddow and Williams think the public health risks are big enough to justify canceling a primary, why wouldn’t they justify postponing the scheduled ones? If canceling a primary is justifiable and doesn’t subvert democracy, surely postponing the scheduled ones is too. If this were about public health and safety, Williams and Maddow would have been imploring governors and the DNC to postpone the primaries until a safer date. But they didn’t. If they cared about saving lives, they would have covered the documented CDC violations. But they didn’t. If they cared about the conduct of presidential candidates, they might have mentioned that after the CDC advisory, one candidate, Bernie Sanders, said he was “not sure” if it made “a lot of sense” to hold the primaries on Tuesday and ceased his Get Out The Vote (GOTV) operation. The other candidate did not cease his GOTV operation, and did not issue a correction when his senior adviser falsely claimed the CDC declared it safe to vote on Tuesday. Since the primary, one candidate has been holding teach-ins and roundtables with medical professionals and members of Congress and has raised over $2 million for charities involved in coronavirus relief. The other candidate was literally nowhere to be found between Tuesday night and the following Monday. Time and time again, Maddow, Williams, and the network for which they work have demonstrated such a strong bias against Sanders that it literally gets in the way of facts like numbers and polling. Public Health Enemy No. 1 at this moment is Donald Trump. As such, one of our most urgent tasks is accurately informing the public about COVID-19 to counter his lies. Instead, the chair of the DNC and the Biden campaign decided to amplify Trump’s message that COVID-19 was no real impediment to public gatherings, and endangered millions of their own voters. And instead of reporting on this urgent story, the media have enabled this dangerous behavior.

,,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"        E-Edition TRENDING:                                           Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews with Pennsylvania voters again suggest it’s not resonating. Santiago sees the recent 38% rise in use of the organization’s food pantry as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.”   “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Election 2020 For some, removing Donald Trump from office isn't enough to dismiss sexual assault allegations raised against the former vice president. Amanda Becker Washington Correspondent Published  Friday was a busy day for Joe Biden. When the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee broke his silence and personally denied a sexual assault allegation by Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, he covered multiple fronts. First, there was a Medium post in which Biden wrote that the allegations “aren’t true” and called on the National Archives to identify and release any record of a complaint made by the staffer. Then, he told Mika Brzezinski “it did not happen” in an MSNBC interview. Finally, there was a virtual fundraiser, where he assured Obama administration alumni that the claim “has no merit.”

And though the former vice president has said “it isn’t enough just to simply take my word for it,” several of his endorsers — many of them high-profile female Democrats — did just that.

“I know Joe Biden,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on CNN Sunday. Sen. Elizabeth Warren told reporters the next day that she found Biden’s denial “credible” and “convincing.” Then, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC that the issue, to her, was closed. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand will host a “Women for Biden” call on Thursday evening. Whitmer, Warren and Gillibrand are thought to be among the more than a dozen women who Biden is considering as a running mate.

As Biden seeks to unite the party by winning over younger and more liberal voters who supported his rivals during the primary race, progressive and women’s groups and voters are signaling that responding to the allegation cannot be a one-day event. Nor should Biden rely on surrogates to answer for him.

Some groups, along with women voters Biden will be relying on in November, warn that a reckoning may be coming for Democrats who are seen as distancing themselves from the #MeToo and #BelieveWomen movements they championed during the Senate confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual misconduct that occurred in high school.

“How do we on the one hand shout out ‘believe women,’ but then not this one?” 62-year-old Laurie Steinke, a Democratic voter in Charleston, South Carolina, said.

In Biden’s case, Reade said in a March interview that he pinned her against a wall and digitally penetrated her in 1993 when she worked in his Senate office. 

“I don’t know what the party needs to do, but the last thing that needs to be done is for it to be flippantly passed by or swept under the rug,” Iowa City resident Amy Chastain, 44, said of the allegation against Biden in an interview. 

Though Chastain supported Warren in Iowa’s caucuses, she said she will back Biden to get President Donald Trump out of office. She worries, though, that some voters might stay home if they feel their choice is between two candidates who have both been accused of sexual assault. Trump has faced more than a dozen allegations of sexual assault or misconduct that he denies. “How do we on the one hand shout out ‘believe women,’ but then not this one?” Biden “should be speaking out profoundly against abuse of power and the systemic, historical problem that we have with men abusing that power,” Chastain said. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Democratic strategists supportive of Biden point to polling showing that the primary motivating factor for many Democrats this election cycle is beating Trump. They note that Biden faces one allegation of sexual assault while Trump faces many, cite the former senator’s role in passing the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, and highlight his stances on issues such as equal pay as differentiators with the current president. “Women in this country sure know the difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden on this issue and frankly a whole lot of others,” said Lily Adams, who advises Unite the Country, a super PAC supporting Biden’s candidacy. Melissa Sayers, a 36-year-old paralegal in Montclair, New Jersey, whose opposition to Trump prompted her to return to college to get degrees in political science and law, said she was “resigned” to backing Biden in November despite the allegations “out of an urgency to replace Trump.” “It’s not ideal, but it’s where we are,” Sayers said. Biden’s campaign did not respond to requests to comment for this story. The Democratic National Committee has rejected calls for an independent investigation of Reade’s claim, with Chairman Tom Perez saying he trusts Biden. Senate officials, citing confidentiality concerns, have said they cannot confirm whether there are records of a harassment complaint Reade said she filed. Biden’s surrogates have moved on to other topics. Biden has little to gain by further discussion of the allegation unless it becomes politically necessary, strategists said. But the pressure may be building on him to do so. At least two Democratic senators — Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon — have broken ranks to call for an independent review of Reade’s claim.  Biden has little to gain by further discussion of the allegation unless it becomes politically necessary, strategists said. But the pressure may be building on him to do so. A Monmouth University poll released on Wednesday showed that 86 percent of registered voters are aware of the allegation. Thirty-seven percent said it was “probably true” and 32 percent said it was “probably not true.” Another 31 percent had no opinion. Potentially more problematic for Biden: 45 percent of voters aged 18 to 34 said they think the allegation is probably true, and 43 percent of independent voters and 37 percent of voters in “swing” counties won by less than 10 points in 2016 thought so too. All are constituencies critical to Biden’s success in November.  The poll shows that some voters believe the allegation but it isn’t “enough to override their desire to oust Trump,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. But Murray said the “outlook is murkier” for those who have yet to form an opinion, including “a number of Democratic-leaning independents who could potentially be swayed.”      A separate Morning Consult poll released earlier in the week showed that 37 percent of registered voters thought sexual harassment and misconduct is a “major issue” for Biden and another 25 percent thought it is a “minor issue” for him.   Michele Dauber, a Democratic fundraiser, Stanford University law professor and chair of the nonpartisan Enough is Enough Voter Project — which seeks to make violence against women a ballot-box issue — said she has been “deeply disappointed, sad and scared” watching Democrats’ response to Reade’s allegation, which is “certainly over the threshold for what deserves an investigation.” “It is aberrant that this is not the next step,” said Dauber, who believes the DNC should hire one of many well-known firms that investigate such matters.  Should such an inquiry conclude the allegation has merit, Dauber believes the party should consider an alternate candidate for the top of the Democratic ticket ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. “We’re not stuck with him,” Dauber added. “It’s not too late, the nominee is selected at the convention.”   The 19th

Georgia has two runoff elections on Tuesday that will decide control of the U.S. Senate and have a decisive influence on the ability of President-elect Joe Biden to advance his legislative agenda. Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s path to victory in Georgia, a key battleground in his reelection bid, is imperiled by lukewarm support from Black voters — the bloc that was crucial to his narrow triumph in the state in 2020. In the Atlanta metro area — home to the second-largest Black population in the US – Black residents said the pain of inflation and setbacks on policies such as student loan forgiveness have left them with misgivings about Biden’s candidacy.  The tepid sentiment is a vulnerability for the president in an election that will likely hinge on voter turnout in a handful of swing states. It highlights the risk that uninspired Black voters stay home or look to third-party alternatives. And it is a concerning signal for the Democratic Party, which has counted on Black voters for decades as a reliable part of its coalition but has recently seen a small erosion of support from this group, including in the 2022 midterm contests. A recent poll found less than one in five Black voters nationwide said they would feel enthusiastic about another four years of Biden. Billy Honor, organizing director at New Georgia Project, has observed that lack of excitement in his work in the state.  “Right now, they aren’t running and jumping that he is the candidate and would liked to have seen another voice,” Honor said. Economic Perceptions To make the case that Biden’s economic policy is delivering for Black voters, the White House has often highlighted economic data points such as record-low unemployment for Black Americans. But the jobless rate for this group has edged up since hitting that milestone in April. Meanwhile inflation — which has cooled recently after soaring to a four-decade high last year — continues to weigh heavily on perceptions of the health of the economy. “The cost of living is going up, and this is affecting everybody, but whenever the economy is bad for everybody, Black America feels it the worst,” said Bezaleel Jupiter, 23. Research has found that Black Americans, as well as Hispanic Americans, experienced higher rates of inflation last year than White Americans. At the same time, Biden has been hemmed in on certain initiatives that are especially important to Black voters. His student-debt relief program was blocked by the Supreme Court, and voting rights bills he has championed failed to pass the Senate. “There’s still a lot of things that he pandered to us as Black people that he’s gotten quiet on,” said Kenneth Harris II, a 32-year-old musician who lives in Southwest Atlanta. A vast majority of Black voters in Georgia, 88%, backed Biden in 2020, according to exit polling. While large swaths of that group remain solidly behind him, Biden can ill afford this frustration in a state where he edged out former President Donald Trump by less than a percentage point in 2020. That margin means even a small drop-off in support in 2024 could be detrimental. The GOP held onto the governor’s mansion in Georgia in 2022, offering a playbook for how the party can compete there next year. Perhaps more significant for Biden’s chances, though, is how many Black voters make a point to show up at the ballot box. Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes in 2020. With Black voters making up 32.9% of the electorate, Georgia’s 16 electoral votes would have gone the other way if less than 1% of Black voters had voted for Trump or simply stayed home. Mary Greene, a 63-year-old financial adviser who voted for Biden in 2020, said “Black people need to hold him accountable” for unfulfilled campaign pledges. “I’m not gonna vote Republican — that’s never gonna happen — but I will be thinking about who will get my vote based upon the promises that they intend to keep,” Greene said. Georgia Allies Democrats sacrificed one potential opportunity to excite the Georgia electorate: The party passed over Atlanta as the site for its 2024 nominating convention, opting instead for Chicago.  Nevertheless, the state appears to be a focal point for Biden. He has stacked his campaign with people who have deep familiarity with Georgia politics, including his principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, who steered Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock’s successful reelection bid in 2022. Michael Tyler, an Atlanta native who worked on the city’s failed bid to host the DNC convention, is communications director. Warnock and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens serve on Biden’s national advisory board. “Georgia is absolutely at the top of our list in terms of states that we need to hold,” Fulks said in an interview. The Biden campaign began running television ads in Atlanta in April. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee bought digital ads and billboards on abortion rights in Georgia and five other battleground states in June. Georgia’s six-week abortion ban is among the strictest in the country. Democrats hope highlighting “extreme” policies embraced by their Republican opponents, on issues like reproductive rights and in a debate over Black history education in schools, will be persuasive to on-the-fence voters. ‘Closing the Margins’ Biden is likely to get a tailwind from the work of outside groups like New Georgia Project, a nonprofit that has registered more than 32,000 voters this year – many of them in densely populated areas that are Democratic bastions. “Elections these days as of late, and particularly in Georgia, have been won on the margins with a very, very small amount of voters,” says Kendra Cotton, the group’s chief executive officer. “We’re closing the margins.” Other groups, like Black Voters Matter and Fair Fight, are doing similar work in the state, many with the intention of combating voter suppression tactics that disproportionately affect Black voters. “We can be just as motivated as we were in 2020, hell, we can be just as motivated as we were in 2008 with Obama, but when you’ve got historic levels of voter suppression, then that same level of motivation and enthusiasm won’t show up the same,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. The backdrop for these groups’ work may change later this month, when Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to announce charging decisions in a probe of efforts by Trump and his supporters to overturn the state’s election results. “He makes everybody want to vote,” Sharon Williams, a Democrat, said of Trump’s impact on turnout. --With assistance from Gregory Korte.

,,Biden wants people to know most of the money he’s seeking for Ukraine would be spent in the US,"Queen City News   by: JAMIE STENGLE and JOSH BOAK, Associated Press Posted: Feb 20, 2024 / 10:09 AM EST Updated: Feb 20, 2024 / 10:10 AM EST    MESQUITE, Texas (AP) — At a bustling construction site outside of Dallas, there are hopes that Congress can finally pass nearly $95 billion in foreign aid including funding for Ukraine — because factory jobs in the United States depend on that money. Aerospace and defense company General Dynamics’ new factory in the Dallas suburb of Mesquite is expected to initially employ 150 people to produce munitions. Set to open in June, construction is nearing completion, with newly planted trees and shrubs already in place at the complex overlooking one of the area’s busiest interstates. “We want to increase our wages and increase our skill levels and job opportunities,” said Kim Buttram, Mesquite’s director of economic development, who added that the factory is expected to have over 300 jobs when it’s at full production. As President Joe Biden pushes House Republicans to pass needed aid, he wants voters to understand that nearly two-thirds — or nearly $40 billion — of the money for Ukraine would actually go to U.S. factories spread out across the country including plants in Lima, Ohio and Scranton, Pennsylvania as well as Mesquite. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has refused to put the bill up for a vote on the House floor on the premise that it does not meet the needs of the American public. The supplemental spending measure contains a total of $95 billion in foreign aid, including money for Ukraine, Israel and other countries. Of the $60.7 billion for Ukraine, $38.8 billion would go to U.S. factories that make missiles, munitions and other gear, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the Biden administration. “While this bill sends military equipment to Ukraine,” Biden said Tuesday, “it spends the money right here in the United States of America in places like Arizona, where the Patriot missiles are built; and Alabama, where the Javelin missiles are built; and Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas, where artillery shells are made.” The president’s argument challenges criticism by some Republican lawmakers that the federal government should be spending more money at home instead of supporting overseas wars. In this case, most of the money goes to U.S. companies and workers, funding assembly lines to refill depleted stockpiles of weapons and gear that have already gone to Ukraine. The Democratic president is openly channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt and resurrecting the World War II-era concept that America is the “arsenal of democracy.” His sales pitch to the public is that his foreign policy is also about jobs for the U.S. middle class. But Biden is brushing up against opposition from former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner who ascended to the White House in 2016 on the promise of reviving U.S. manufacturing. Trump opposes the U.S. package to help Ukraine and has openly expressed a willingness to let Russia invade NATO allies who do not spend enough of their own budgets on defense. Many Republicans in Congress have taken their lead from Trump, with the party’s right flank increasingly questioning the value of U.S. interventions around the world and long-standing alliances built in the aftermath of World War II. Johnson has refused to bring the foreign aid bill up for a vote because it also lacks provisions to secure the U.S. southern border where immigrants are crossing illegally. But he previously rejected a bipartisan Senate bill that did provide funding to address immigration challenges, saying that the border measures would not solve the problem in the way that he wanted. “The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Republican senators,” Johnson said at a news conference last week. “It’s time for Washington to start showing some love to Americans.” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, in contrast, has repeatedly implored his colleagues to understand that the funds from the package are for historic investments “right here in America.” “This is about rebuilding the arsenal of democracy,” McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a floor speech during the long days of debate, “and demonstrating to our allies and adversaries alike that we’re serious about exercising American strength.” The Mesquite factory sits in the congressional district of Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, who told Fox Business News in a December interview that he couldn’t tell his constituents that he voted for money for Ukraine without also getting money to secure the U.S. southern border. “I will never support any funding for Ukraine that does not include major measures of security at our own southern border,” said Gooden. His office did not respond to questions sent over email from The Associated Press for this story. U.S. factories shipped out nearly $162 billion worth of military goods last year, according to the Census Bureau. The shipments increased 8.1% compared to 2022. The supplemental funding could further drive factory production upward this year. But defense manufacturing can be volatile. Spending declined between 2010 and 2015. It then grew over the next four years, only to dip in 2021 and then climb again after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Biden administration has made an increase in the manufacturing capacity of defense contractors a priority, with a plan to increase the production of 155-millimeter artillery shells six-fold over three years. The supplemental bill stalled in the House would expand these efforts by making new investments in production lines for weapons and revitalizing the industrial base for submarine production, according to the White House. But on Friday, after news of the death of imprisoned Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, Biden again pushed House Republicans to pass aid to Ukraine and take a stand against Russian leader Vladimir Putin. But the House had gone into recess on Thursday afternoon. “It’s about time they step up — don’t you think? — instead of going on a two-week vacation,” Biden said. “What are they thinking? My God, this is bizarre.” ___ AP chief congressional correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report. Boak reported from Washington. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

,,Nikki Haley insists she can lose South Carolina and still get the nomination – but that would defy history,"Assistant Professor of Political Science, Boise State University Charles R.

View all partners Former South Carolina governor and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, a Republican, has lost the first four presidential primary contests, but has vowed to stay in the race for the foreseeable future. Haley seems to be counting on support from her home state of South Carolina to put her in a more competitive position against former President Donald J. Trump. Political science gives Haley a good reason to bank on doing well in South Carolina. For one thing, a candidate has naturally higher name recognition in their home state after having built a career and reputation there. Voters have gotten to know them and their record of achievement, and the candidate knows the culture of the state and its political pressure points. Shared ties in a state are also a meaningful identity that strengthens connections with voters based on trust. Being an out-of-towner, on the other hand, can make you seem out-of-touch. Just ask Dr. Oz, whose many gaffes during his 2022 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania highlighted his deep roots in neighboring New Jersey. These conditions can add up to a big electoral advantage that Haley might be counting on in South Carolina.  Unfortunately for Haley, every single poll of her home state’s voters conducted over the past two months has Trump ahead of her by more than 20 points. She recently argued that it doesn’t matter if she doesn’t win South Carolina, as long as she closes “the gap” with Trump. But if she does lose her home state, does she still have any shot at the nomination? The historical data reveal that the answer is an emphatic “no.” I collected election results for both parties’ presidential primaries for each election year from 1992 to 2020. I then compared the percentage of the vote they received in their home state’s primary with the average they received in other states’ primaries held slightly before or on the same day as their home state.  First, every eventual nominee in this time period performed at least as well, if not better in their home state’s primary than in other comparable primaries. Even Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who were historically unpopular candidates in 2016, followed this trend. The same is true for nearly all of the major presidential primary candidates during this time. The data also tell us that, in the history of the modern presidential primary, since 1972, there has not been a single eventual nominee from either party who did not win their home state. In this sense, Haley winning the nomination without her home state would be literally unprecedented. Of course, Haley might have other outcomes in mind. Even if she remains a consistent second-place finisher in the primaries, she could wait in the wings for the nomination if Trump’s legal difficulties prevent him from serving in some way. But the evidence says that winning the nomination outright will be next to impossible for Haley without first winning the primary in her home state.

,,Poll: Nearly half of voters have ruled out sup­porting Biden and Trump,"       A little more than 17 months before the 2024 presidential election, voters have a better idea of which candidates they absolutely won’t vote for than the one they will support, according to a new Monmouth University poll. The poll, released Thursday, asked voters about the likelihood they would support a particular candidate in three hypothetical general-election matchups. All three scenarios included President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. Those surveyed were asked about Biden facing either former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or former Vice President Mike Pence, all Republicans. The goal of the poll was to gauge each candidate’s floor and ceiling. “Negative opinion can be difficult to shift, and when it does it tends to be in the wrong direction for the candidate,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “That’s not to say these views won’t change in the next year and a half, but these results are a sign of how few voters are truly up for grabs in our hyper-partisan political environment.” Just under half of voters — 46% to 48% — said they definitely would not vote for Biden in any of the three matchups, with another 7% to 8% saying they probably would not vote for the incumbent president. Thirty-two percent said they definitely would support and 13% said they’d likely support Biden against Trump. The backing for Biden was similar in a DeSantis matchup — 31% definitely voting for the current president, 12% probably voting for him. The percentage of the electorate already ruling out Trump is about the same, the poll found. Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they definitely won’t vote for Trump  if he faces Biden, with another 8% saying they probably would not support the former president. Twenty-nine percent said they would definitely cast their ballot for Trump, and 12% more said they probably would. Fewer poll participants said they are dismissing the possibility of voting for DeSantis or Pence, although both of the Republicans are lagging behind both Trump and Biden when it comes to ardent supporters. Forty-one percent said they definitely won’t vote for DeSantis over Biden — and 11% said they probably would not — while 26% said they’d definitely support the Florida governor and 16% percent said they probably would. Thirty-six percent ruled out supporting Pence against Biden, and 18% said they probably would not vote for him. Eighteen percent said they’d definitely support Pence, and another 22% said they probably would. When looking strictly at definite and probable support, Biden outperformed his hypothetical opponent in all three scenarios: 45% to 41% against Trump, 43% to 42% against DeSantis and 42% to 40% against Pence.

,,Nikki Haley insists she’s not dropping out of 2024 race ahead of major address: Live," Former UN ambassador points to stongest fundraising of career to keep campaign going  Related: Nikki Haley says she would pardon Donald Trump if elected president Ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Nikki Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of the result in South Carolina this Saturday, vowing to stay in the 2024 race at least until after Super Tuesday on 5 March. The former governor and UN ambassador has yet to win any state against frontrunner Donald Trump. Ms Haley made headlines over the weekend by declining to say she would endorse Mr Trump but promising to pardon him if she entered the White House. The former president reacted furiously to those comments, appearing to object to Ms Haley effectively “legitimising” the criminal cases against him, contrary to his baseless insistence that they are all part of a conspiracy being orchestrated by President Joe Biden and his myriad enemies. Meanwhile, Senator Tim Scott, an energetic Trump cheerleader, called on Ms Haley to suspend her campaign, saying he senses “desperation” around her. In the same interview, Mr Scott made the preposterous claim that Democrats want an open, insecure border, whereas Republicans “know that means you have to control your back door”, despite the fact that it is GOP members holding up relevant spending bills in Congress. Trump and Biden are two old men who are only getting older. Nearly 60% of Americans say Trump and Biden are both too old to be president—because they are. We’ve all seen them fumble their words and get confused about world leaders. That’s not who you want in the Oval Office when Russia launches a nuclear weapon at our satellites or China shuts down our electricity grid. We’re talking about the most demanding job in human history. You don’t give it to someone who’s at risk of dementia. You give it to someone who is disciplined—someone who can work day and night for eight years straight. No vendettas. No drama. Just results. Even if Trump and Biden weren’t too old—and again, they are—Americans still oppose them because we know what they’ll do. They’ve already done tremendous damage—and they’re just getting started. After bashing President Biden about the border, Ms Haley turned her focus to Mr Trump calling him “unhinged” and focused on the past and not the future. It’s not normal to insult our military heroes and veterans. It’s not normal to spend fifty million dollars in campaign donations on personal court cases. It’s not normal to threaten the people who back your opponent. And it’s not normal to call on Russia to invade NATO countries. Donald Trump has done all that and more in just the last month. Look, I’ve said it many times -- I think Donald Trump was the right president at the right time. But times change—and so has Trump. He’s gotten more unstable and unhinged. He spends more time in courtrooms than on the campaign trail. He refuses to debate. He’s completely distracted. And everything is about him. He’s so obsessed with his own demons from the past, he can’t focus on delivering the future Americans deserve. Nikki Haley tells a crowd of supporters: “South Carolina will vote on Saturday. But on Sunday, I’ll still be running for president. I’m not going anywhere.” She jokes regarding the attacks she and Donald Trump have made at each other: “Some people used to say I was running because I really wanted to be Vice President. I think I’ve pretty well settled that question.” “We don’t anoint kings in this country. We have elections. And Donald Trump, of all people, should know we don’t rig elections!” Ms Haley says. Of the current president, she says: “First thing’s first: Joe Biden is doing more damage to himself than any Republican could ever do. Every time he opens his mouth, he sounds like his mind is closing up shop.” Trump not happy Trump, in recent days, has shown flashes of fury in response to Haley’s refusal to cede the nomination. He called her “stupid” and “birdbrain” in a social media post over the weekend and his campaign released a memo ahead of her speech on Tuesday predicting that she would be forced out of the race after losing her home state on Saturday. “The true ‘State’ of Nikki Haley’s campaign?” Trump’s campaign chiefs wrote. “Broken down, out of ideas, out of gas, and completely outperformed by every measure, by Donald Trump.” Eager to pivot toward a general election matchup against Biden, the Republican former president is taking aggressive steps to assume control of the Republican National Committee, the GOP’s nationwide political machine, which is supposed to stay neutral in presidential primary elections. Last week, Trump announced plans to install his campaign’s senior adviser Chris LaCivita, as RNC’s chief operating officer and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as the committee’s co-chair. And there is every expectation that current Chair Ronna McDaniel will step down after Trump wins South Carolina’s primary and party officials will ultimately acquiesce to Trump’s wishes. Privately, Haley’s team concedes there is nothing it can do to stop the Trump takeover. In the interview, Haley warned her party against letting Trump raid the RNC’s coffers to pay for his legal fees while taking a short-term view of Trump’s political prospects. Trump’s standing will fundamentally change if he is a convicted felon before Election Day, Haley said, acknowledging that such an outcome is a very real possibility as Trump navigates 91 felony charges across four separate criminal cases. “People are not looking six months down the road when these court cases have taken place,” Haley said. “He’s going to be in a courtroom all of March, April, May and June. How in the world do you win a general election when these cases keep going and the judgments keep coming?” As for her path forward, Haley said she’s focused only on her plans through Super Tuesday. As for staying in the race through the July convention, she said she hasn’t thought that far ahead. Some voters wish she would. Gil White, a 75-year-old Republican veteran from James Island, South Carolina, said he was a Trump loyalist until the former president criticized Haley’s husband, a military serviceman, last week. “For him to disparage a military man in deployment is just too much,” White said while attending a Haley rally in Kiawah Island over the weekend. He acknowledged concerns about Haley’s chances against Trump, but said he wants her to stay in the race even if she continues to lose. “I want the choice,” he said. Haley’s campaign raised $5 million in a fundraising swing after her second-place finish in New Hampshire that included stops in Texas, Florida, New York, and California, Perez-Cubas said. Her campaign raised $16.5 million in January alone — her best fundraising month ever — which includes $2 million in small-dollar donations online in the 48 hours after Trump threatened to “permanently bar” Haley supporters from his MAGA movement. Haley raised another $1 million last week in the 24 hours after Trump attacked her husband, a military serviceman currently serving overseas. The lone member of Congress who has endorsed Haley, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., insisted that she would stay in the race even if she is blown out in South Carolina, a state where she lives and served two terms as governor. “Obviously, you want to win them all, but for those who say it’s going to embarrass her, or end her political career, I disagree. She’s willing to take that risk,” Norman said in an interview. “I think it’s a courageous thing she’s doing.” Moving forward, Haley’s team is especially focused on several Super Tuesday states with open or semi-open Republican primaries that allows a broader collection of voters to participate — especially independents and moderates — instead of just hardcore conservatives. Continued... Haley’s Hurdles History would suggest Haley has no chance of stopping Trump. Never before has a Republican lost even the first two primary contests, as Haley has by an average of 21 points, and gone on the win the party’s presidential nomination. Polls suggest she is a major underdog in her home state on Saturday and in the 16 Super Tuesday contests to follow. And since he announced his first presidential bid in 2015, every effort by a Republican to blunt Trump’s rise has failed. Yet she is leaning into the fight. Lest anyone question her commitment, Haley’s campaign is spending more than $500,000 on a new television advertising campaign set to begin running Wednesday in Michigan ahead of the state’s Feb. 27 primary, according to spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. At the same time, the AP has obtained Haley’s post-South Carolina travel schedule that features 11 separate stops in seven days across Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and Massachusetts. The schedule also includes at least 10 high-dollar private fundraising events. Indeed, Haley’s expansive base of big- and small-dollar donors is donating at an extraordinary pace despite her underwhelming performance at the polls. That’s a reflection of persistent Republican fears about Trump’s ability to win over independents and moderate voters in the general election and serious concerns about his turbulent leadership should he return to the White House. “I’m going to support her up to the convention,” said Republican donor Eric Levine, who co-hosted a New York fundraiser for Haley earlier this month. “We’re not prepared to fold our tents and pray at the alter of Donald Trump.” “There’s value in her sticking in and gathering delegates, because if and when he stumbles,” Levine continued, “who knows what happens.” Levine is far from alone. Continued... There are no wins on the horizon for Nikki Haley. Those close to the former United Nations ambassador, the last major Republican candidate standing in Donald Trump’s path to the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination, are privately bracing for a blowout loss in her home state’s primary election in South Carolina on Saturday. And they cannot name a state where she is likely to beat Trump in the coming weeks. But ahead of a major address on Tuesday, Haley told The Associated Press that she will not leave the Republican primary election regardless of Saturday’s result. And backed by the strongest fundraising numbers of her political career, she vowed to stay in the fight against Trump at least until after Super Tuesday’s slate of more than a dozen contests on March 5. “Ten days after South Carolina, another 20 states vote. I mean, this isn’t Russia. We don’t want someone to go in and just get 99% of the vote,” Haley said. “What is the rush? Why is everybody so panicked about me having to get out of this race?” In fact, some Republicans are encouraging Haley to stay in the campaign even if she continues to lose — potentially all the way to the Republican National Convention in July. Her continued presence could come in handy in the event that the 77-year-old former president, perhaps the most volatile major party front-runner in U.S. history, becomes a convicted felon or stumbles into another major scandal. As Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement presses for her exit, a defiant Haley will outline her rationale for sticking in the race for the foreseeable future Tuesday afternoon in South Carolina. In an interview ahead of the speech, she highlighted Trump’s legal exposure and criticized MAGA activists who say she’s hurting Trump’s chances against President Joe Biden in the general election by refusing to drop out. “That’s about the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. If I get out of the race today, it will be the longest general election in history,” Haley said. She also pushed back when asked if there is any primary state where she can defeat Trump. “Instead of asking me what states I’m gonna win, why don’t we ask how he’s gonna win a general election after spending a full year in a courtroom?” The Biden campaign and the Democratic Party raised more $42m in January in a fundraising haul “driven by” grassroots efforts, officials said. The Democrats now have $130m in cash on hand as the general election season is set to be one of the longest in recent memory. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement that “January’s fundraising haul – driven by a powerhouse grassroots fundraising program that continues to grow month by month – is an indisputable show of strength to start the election year”.

,,"In Michigan, anger over Biden's Israel-Hamas war stance could cost him votes: ""We're gonna be silent in November 2024""","Watch CBS News December 11, 2023 / 9:22 AM EST / CBS News Four years ago, Adam Abusalah campaigned for Joe Biden, urging his neighbors in predominantly Arab-American Dearborn, Michigan, to vote against Donald Trump. Today, the 23-year-old's concerns about President Biden are sounding an alarm bell for Democrats.  As the administration continues standing by Israel's deadly attacks on Gaza, Abusalah says he and his community can no longer support the president, given his steadfast support of Israel. ""If you were to ask me two months ago, if I was gonna vote for Joe Biden, yeah, I would've held my nose and voted for him,"" Abusalah said. But then, Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Israel retaliated with devastating assaults on the Gaza Strip. The health ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip says the overall death toll there since the start of the war had surpassed 15,200. Abusalah warns that anger in the U.S. over Israel's attacks could cost the president the election.  ""The same way that they're being silent right now in the face of injustices, we're gonna be silent in November 2024,"" Abusalah said. When asked whether Muslim Americans will stay home on Election Day, Abusalah replied, ""No, we're gonna go vote. But we're gonna keep the top of the ticket empty."" When faced with a prospective Biden loss, which could mean a Trump presidency, Abusalah said, ""If you were to tell me that my vote would be the vote, whether Biden wins in Michigan or not, I would still not vote for Biden. … My people dying is that much of an issue for me."" Abdullah Hammoud, Dearborn's first-ever Arab-American mayor, says for many here, the Israel-Hamas war is deeply personal.  ""We have some residents who've lost entire families,"" he said. A Democrat, the mayor credits legislation signed by the president for pumping tens of millions of dollars of federal aid into his city.  ""The domestic policies that President Biden has achieved have been nothing short of phenomenal,"" Hammoud said. But he has his own strong views on what's happening in Gaza.  ""You cannot overlook the genocide that's taken place, and you have to weigh that on a scale,"" he said. He believes that Mr. Biden's response to the Oct. 7 attacks has been ""awful."" Holding Michigan, a swing state, is key to a Biden victory in 2024. In 2020 Mr. Biden defeated Trump there by about 154,000 votes; 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the state, with nearly 70% nationwide going for the president.   A CBS News poll released Sunday shows that 38% of Democrats believe the president is showing ""too much"" support for Israel, up from 28% in October.  Osama Siblani, the co-founder and former president of the Arab American Political Action Committee (AAPAC), Mr. Biden reached out to this organization prior to his election in 2020 and said he promised to include an Arab American in his cabinet. ""We don't have a cabinet member. We don't have an assistant, deputy, whatever,"" Siblani said. ""We don't even have a standing place in the room with Joe Biden. Biden and both senators won because of our vote. There is one thing for sure; that at this time, if the election were held today, American Muslims will not vote for the top ticket."" A Biden campaign spokesperson says the president continues to work closely and proudly with leaders in the Muslim and Palestinian communities across the country, while the White House says it is tirelessly working to increase the urgent delivery of aid to people in Gaza. There are some Arab American voters in the region who have not completely withdrawn their support for the president. Ahmed Boomrad, the executive chairman of GDI Integrated Facility Services, empathizes with his community's frustration but refrains from harshly judging the administration. Despite the challenges, he intends to cast his vote in favor of Mr. Biden in 2024. ""Can the administration do more? Absolutely. But If I'm being fair, the Biden administration has had real achievements,"" Boomrad said. Boomrad pointed to Mr. Biden repealing the Muslim ban, appointing a record number of Muslim Americans, including federal court judges, and helping to resolve the longstanding Lebanese Israeli maritime border dispute, during the early days of his presidency. But younger voters are more like Abusalah and less forgiving of the president. At the Michigan State University campus in Lansing, where students gathered in late November to demand a ceasefire, several protestors held signs, in which some read ""No Ceasefire No Vote,"" while others said ""Biden: Fund Climate Action Not Genocide."" Some students even dubbed the president as ""Genocide Joe."" A Lebanese student, Alissa Hakim, 21, a senior at MSU, said Mr. Biden has lost her vote. Instead, she implored her fellow peers to vote for an independent candidate. ""With the way things are now, I'm not very hopeful that it won't be another Biden vs. Trump candidacy, but I would implore people to vote third party rather than abstain,"" Hakim said. Ed O'Keefe is CBS News senior White House and political correspondent. He previously worked for The Washington Post covering presidential campaigns, Congress and federal agencies.

,,What Voters Could Biden's VP Pick Mobilize?,"With Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, there has been speculation about who he will choose to be his running mate. Biden has pledged that his vice-presidential pick will be a woman stating, “There are a number of women who qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” After making this commitment in mid-March, journalists and political pundits wasted no time generating lists of qualified women who Joe Biden could potentially choose to be his running mate. Despite pundits and party elites placing an outsized level of importance on the VP pick, rarely has a vice presidential running mate had more than a trivial impact on an election outcome. However, we arguably face the most important and consequential presidential election in modern history. In the context of global pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of Americans, devastated the economy, left millions of Americans unemployed, and pushed our healthcare system to the brink, Biden’s pick for VP choice may be perceived as far more meaningful than in past elections. Furthermore, given Biden’s age, there is a distinct possibility that whoever he chooses will be running a presidential race in 2024. So much of the perceived strategy of Biden’s choice hinges on what we think is more crucial to Biden’s success- “persuasion targets” verses “turnout targets.” Is the goal to increase turnout among younger voters and voters of color? Given the difference in turnout between 2012 and 2016 among black voters and the expanding Latino electorate in key states, this is a prudent goal. One of the most defining divides in the Democratic primary was the age difference in support for Biden, with voters under 45 more likely to have supported Bernie Sanders and voters over 45 more likely to support Biden. Furthermore, young voters (who are also more likely to be voters of color) simply turn out to vote at much lower levels. Polling shows that Biden has a huge lead over Trump with young voters, but this issue will inevitably be one of turnout. But is the more important goal to target persuadable voters? These voters would include white voters in the Midwest (many who voted for Trump in 2016), white suburbanites, moderate and conservative voters, as well as Independents. Despite changing demographics in the U.S., white men still make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018, 41% of white men voted for Democrats and undoubtedly helped contribute to their success. Polling shows that the split among white voters by college education is essentially the same as it was in 2016; whites without a college degree support Trump over Biden by about 30 points. However, the same polling also highlights the fact that Biden has not significantly increased support among whites with a college degree. Speculation about the veepstakes is likely to pick up even more momentum as former Vice President Biden recently announced a panel of advisors to aid him in the selection of a running mate. Although there are many think pieces devoted to discussing who would be the smartest strategic pick for Biden, most fail to substantively discuss or provide data on what kind of voters each potential VP nominee might attract. Using relevant data from recent surveys, elections, and each potential VP’s past successes, I evaluate the types of voters each VP pick might be able to mobilize and how much of a boon that potential mobilization would be to the Biden campaign.   1. Stacey Abrams Stacey Abrams rose to national prominence when she ran as the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor in 2018. While some of the other potential running mates under consideration have remained coy about any vice-presidential ambitions, Abrams has been open about her desire to serve as Biden’s VP. She has noted her history of fighting to protect the right to vote, her experience serving as her party’s minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, and has argued that it would be a mistake for Joe Biden not to pick a black woman like herself. Abrams told Jake Tapper on CNN, “As a young black woman, growing up in Mississippi, I learned that if you don't raise your hand, people won't see you, and they won't give you attention.” Given Abrams newcomer status to national politics, there are limited data points to draw from that speak to the types of voters she might bring into the fold. But her past performances offer some insights. Abrams lost her gubernatorial bid to then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp by a thin margin. Kemp was overseeing the election that he competed in and enforced some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country, resulting in allegations of voter suppression. Despite this, more black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Latino voters turned out in Georgia’s 2018 midterm election than in the 2016 presidential election. Georgia was the only state where midterm turnout was greater than presidential turnout among voters of color. This speaks to Abrams’ ability to mobilize voters of color who might otherwise stay home on Election Day. Additionally, Abrams achieved this without losing the support for white voters. She won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama. In the Data for Progress poll, 17% of black voters chose Abrams as their preferred VP nominee (second only to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren at 22%). Furthermore, a plurality (21%) of black voters felt that Abrams would be the most effective in implementing policies as VP.   2.  Senator Tammy Baldwin Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has largely flown under the radar in the veepstakes discussion and has been left out of most national polling. Wisconsin is emerging as one of the most crucial (if not the most crucial) battleground state in the 2020 election. Baldwin has been in the Senate since 2013 and is the first openly LGBT member of the Senate. Although she lacks name recognition nationally, Senator Baldwin won her 2018 race by double digits. This is no small feat in a purple state like Wisconsin where Democrat Tony Evers beat Scott Walker in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a razor thin margin (slightly over 1%). In fact, about 8% of voters split their ticket and supported both Walker and Baldwin. Exit polls show that 10% of Republicans and 59% of Independents or non-affiliated voters voted for Baldwin. This fact speaks to Baldwin’s ability to put together a coalition that includes both progressives, Independents, and even some Trump supports. Another potential strength is her progressive bona fides. She is one of the most liberal members of the U.S. Senate. This could mobilize progressives who feel lukewarm about Biden.   3. Senator Tammy Duckworth Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth is another woman on this list who has made history. She won her 2016 election and became the second Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, the first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress, and the first Senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is a combat veteran and was the first female double amputee from the Iraq War (her Black Hawk helicopter was shot down by Iraqi insurgents). She served in the house for four years before running for the Senate. Although Duckworth has not been included in many national polls, YouGov polling indicates that she is slightly more popular among millennials and men. In her 2016 Senate victory, she won only 17 out of Illinois’ 102 counties. Duckworth won by huge margins in terms of total votes in urban counties which secured her victory. According to CNN exit polls from 2016, she did particularly well among non-white voters, and notably, voters without a college degree as well as moderates and Independents. Senator Duckworth previously served as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and was appointed by President Barack Obama to be the Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. She has a long history of advocating for vets. Although the relationship between electoral victory and candidate military experience is nuanced, researchers have found that people use candidates’ military service to make inferences about defense competence and interventionism that can lead to higher support among some groups of voters. Other work has found that voters overwhelming perceive candidates with military experience to be more competent in handling national security and defense issues. It’s difficult to extrapolate what this might mean in terms of any potential benefit to the Biden campaign. However, Duckworth’s distinct lived experience as a veteran, Asian-American woman, a person with a physical disability, and a new mother, might appeal to voters seeking representation and recognition in the next administration.
  4. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham Another governor that has garnered attention as a potential veep choice is New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Lujan Grisham became the first Latina Democratic woman governor in 2019, after serving three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Despite holding these posts, Lujan Grisham’s national profile remains relatively low, reducing the amount of data from which to draw in predicting her influence on a presidential ticket. Elected from both a majority-Latino district and state and as the former head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Lujan Grisham would bring strong ties to the Latino community. This might help a Biden presidential ticket with mobilizing Latino voters. In the presidential primary, Sanders did far better with Latino voters than Biden. A recent survey from Latino Decisions shows support for Biden at 59% among Latinos, compared to just two months ago when it was at 67%. According to New York Times, Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc this fall. Latino support in key swing states like Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania could be decisive for Biden. It’s also worth noting, given the current public health crisis, that Governor Lujan Grisham began her career as a health commissioner in Bernalillo County and ultimately was appointed as New Mexico’s Secretary of Health. Lujan Grisham has also been garnering high approval ratings (62%) for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic.   5. Senator Kamala Harris Out of all the potential VP nominees, the one that has perhaps been cited the most as a likely pick is Senator Kamala Harris. In a March 2020 YouGov poll, 18% of Democratic primary voters selected Kamala Harris as their preferred choice for Biden’s running mate (second only to Warren). In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Harris was in the middle of pack with 10% of respondents choosing her as their preferred VP running mate. Her support, also in the Harvard poll, remains relatively stable across age groups, although older voters preferred her slightly more than younger voters. There was also a notable gap in support for Harris across racial lines with 16% of black voters selecting her verses 9% of white voters. However, it’s unclear how much of a benefit this is to the Biden coalition given his already deeply entrenched support in the black community. It’s also not a given that Kamala Harris, a black woman, would mobilize black voters. During the presidential race, Harris, as well as the only other black candidate in the race, Cory Booker, were unable to make inroads in South Carolina, a state where African Americans are about a third of the population and an even larger proportion of Democratic voters. One promising data point for Harris is that, in the March YouGov poll, she garnered the highest support among Hispanic voters (26%) in VP selection. The Latino vote will be an essential voting bloc in 2020. Based on these data points, it’s clear that while Democratic primary voters have generally warm feelings towards Kamala Harris, but her support among other groups suggests that she might have trouble generating enthusiasm outside of the existing Biden coalition.   6. Senator Amy Klobuchar Another potential VP pick is Senator Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar has 63% favorability among Democratic primary voters according to the latest YouGov poll. The moderate Minnesota senator displays major strength among older voters, particularly those 65 and older. In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Klobuchar was the preferred VP choice for 19% of respondents 65 and older (the most popular choice among that age group) and 12% of voters 50-64 compared to only 3% of voters 18-34 and 5% of voters 35-49. These numbers indicate that Senator Klobuchar will better mobilize older voters. In the YouGov poll, she is the second highest in support from Democratic primary voters age 65+. However, it’s important to note that generally, these voters are already mobilized. We know that older people go to the polls at significantly larger numbers than younger people. According to CNN exit polls during the midterm election, 56% of voters were over age 50 and 26% were 65 or over. By comparison, only 13% of voters were under the age of 30 and this was considered a high turnout for young voters. Klobuchar clearly appeals to older voters but it’s unclear that would be a significant benefit to the Biden coalition. It is worth noting that in the Harvard poll, Klobuchar was tied with Sanders as the preferred candidate of voters who voted for Trump in 2016, suggesting she could pick off some Trump voters. During the presidential primary, where Klobuchar hit a stumbling block was with voters of color. She out-performed expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire (overwhelmingly white states), but failed to mobilize voters of color, particularly black voters, in Nevada and South Carolina, effectively ending her presidential bid.   7. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made history when she became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. She served as the Attorney General of Nevada from 2007 to 2015 but has not yet achieved much of a national profile. Cortez Masto was included on the most recent Data for Progress poll where she garnered only 1% of support from Democratic voters, most likely a result of her low name ID. As one of the very few Latina women in Congress and as a statewide representative of a state where Latinos are 29% of the population, Cortez Masto has the potential to and experience in mobilizing Latino voters. Her knowledge of and popularity in a swing state like Nevada is also worth weighing in considering her benefit to a presidential ticket.   8. Senator Elizabeth Warren It was only a month and a half ago that Senator Elizabeth Warren, once a front-runner, dropped out of the presidential race. A little over a week ago she endorsed Joe Biden and when asked by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC how she would respond if Biden asked her to serve as vice president, Warren responded “Yes.” Warren has been the leading woman candidate among Democrats in two recent polls. In an April 2020 Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, 13% of all respondents chose Warren as their preferred VP pick.[1] This is second only to the 20% of respondents who chose Senator Bernie Sanders. When Data for Progress listed only women contenders in another April 2020 survey, 31% of Democratic respondents chose Warren, with Senator Kamala Harris coming in second with 18% of support. Notably, 42% of Democrats identified Warren as the potential vice presidential candidate most ready to be president. In a recent YouGov poll, Elizabeth Warren had the highest favorability (77%) among Democratic primary voters. Other YouGov polling suggests similarly positive feelings for Warren. A plurality of Democratic primary voters in a March 2020 poll said that Biden should select Warren as his VP. These data points highlight that the Democratic base generally has warm feelings towards Warren. However, conventional wisdom during and after her presidential bid was that the Massachusetts senator does better with women, more educated voters, and more liberal voters. The extant data seems to bear this out. Out of the five women candidates who were included as response options in the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the gender gap in support was the largest for Elizabeth Warren with 15% of women selecting Warren as their preferred pick compared to 11% of men in the survey. Similarly, YouGov polling from March indicates that among Democratic primary voters, 29% of women and 25% of men think that Elizabeth Warren should be selected as the nominee for vice-president. According to NBC exit polls, this gender gap was consistent in almost every presidential primary contest as well. In the presidential primary, Warren lost in her home state and struggled to win support among white men without college degrees (although Warren did do better with college-educated white men than with working class white women underscoring the complicated gender dynamics at play). Another weak spot for Warren is with Independent voters. Exit polls from her 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate showed that her that her opponent, Scott Brown, did better with Independent voters, particularly men. This weak spot played out in the 2020 presidential primary in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and several other Super Tuesday states.   9. Governor Gretchen Whitmer Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as another potential running mate for Joe Biden, particularly as she rose to national consciousness because of her response to the Covid-19 pandemic and her outspoken criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis. Whitmer has a long and successful electoral history, having served three terms in the Michigan House of Representatives and two terms in the Michigan Senate before her gubernatorial run in 2018. Given Michigan’s status as a crucial battleground state and the fact that Trump won Michigan in 2016 by the narrowest margin in the history of the state, it makes sense that Governor Whitmer is on the short list. Whitmer is rated favorably by 47% of Democratic primary voters, although it’s important to note that over 40% were unfamiliar with her. She is also popular in her state. Despite criticism from some Republicans over her aggressive response to Covid-19 and protests over the stay-at-home orders, Whitmer’s approval rating is 60% in Michigan (15 points higher than Trump’s approval rating in the state). With limited data, it’s difficult to discern what types of voters might be energized by Whitmer as a VP pick. In the Data for Progress poll, only 3% of Democratic voters chose Whitmer as their VP choice, which is likely a product of low name ID. However, her win in 2018 demonstrated her ability to put together a diverse coalition of black voters, suburban women, blue collar workers, and even voters in conservative parts of the state.   What does it all mean? When considering the potential VP nominees (although this list is not exhaustive), the various data points we can draw from, the voter bases that Biden needs to reach, the idiosyncrasies of this particular election environment, and the dubiousness of the importance of the VP pick, it’s difficult to extract any conclusions about who is the best strategic choice for Joe Biden. What does seem instinctively true is the heightened importance of this choice in this particular moment and the long list of highly qualified women who would bring myriad benefits to the presidential ticket. Furthermore, given the recent allegations of sexual assault against Joe Biden, all of the women on this list will have to thread the needle between supporting Biden without being perceived as being dismissive of the allegations. As Rebecca Traister outlined in her article in The Cut, any woman who accepts Biden’s invitation to be his running mate will become ensnared in this controversy. For both Biden and the potential VP nominee, there will be trade-offs. Ultimately, it’s less about who Biden chooses and more about the voters she will bring along. [1] It’s worth noting a few caveats regarding the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll. The summary data available for this poll includes preference for each candidate across various demographic groups. Survey respondents including Republican, Democratic, and third-party voters and we were unable to restrict our analysis to only Democratic voters.

,,Voters Say Those on the Other Side ‘Don’t Get’ Them. Here’s What They Want Them to Know.,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  In the wake of a bitterly contested presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants to work to narrow the nation’s deep partisan divisions. It is likely to be a formidable task. Voters who supported Biden and Donald Trump say they not only differ over policies, but also have fundamental disagreements over core American values. Yet there is a sentiment with which large shares of both Biden and Trump voters agree: a feeling that those who supported the other candidate have little or no understanding of people like them. Just 2% of Biden voters – and an equally small share of Trump voters – say those who voted for the opposing candidate understand them “very well,” according to Pew Research Center’s November post-election survey. If they had the chance, what would Biden and Trump voters want those on the opposing side to know about them to understand them better? Pew Research Center asked them – and they had a lot to say. Explore a sampling of voters’ word-for-word answers, and see how some common themes emerge. Many voters responded by asserting their own political values: About a quarter of Biden voters (26%) and 32% of Trump voters wanted their counterparts to know some of the key values that are important to them. About one-in-ten Biden (12%) and Trump voters (11%) used the opportunity to tell those in the other camp not to ascribe negative stereotypes to them. These voters described in some detail how they feel mischaracterized and how the other side’s criticisms of them are flawed or inaccurate. Some voters struck themes of unity and common ground, including 13% of Biden voters and 5% of Trump supporters. They offered a perspective that Biden and Trump supporters are more alike than they are different or expressed a need for both groups to recognize each other as Americans. While some voters called for unity, larger shares (21% of Biden voters and 23% of Trump voters) criticized the opposing candidate or his supporters, often in harsh terms. This included explanations of why they are personally against Trump, Biden, or their opposing party’s behavior and policies. Two other themes worth noting were expressed by small shares of both Trump and Biden voters: 7% of Trump voters and 6% of Biden voters wrote about how they believe the other side is being misinformed. And about 3% of Biden and Trump voters took this opportunity to share personal, humanizing details about themselves.

,,Biden looking good – but concern over polls means Democrats are cautious,"Biden is up to 16 points ahead nationally as must-win states seem safe, but experts say polls don’t reflect what will happen when votes are counted As the Democratic presidential primaries drew to a close in the spring, Laura Hubka was left wondering how she was going to sell Joe Biden to voters in her corner of rural Iowa. Hubka, an ultrasound technologist and chair of Howard county Democrats, lamented that the party cast aside an array of more inspirational, younger and original candidates in favor of a fading politician past his prime. Personally, she backed Pete Buttigieg, the young, gay former Indiana mayor. Hubka couldn’t see how a candidate as uninspiring as Biden would draw support away from the president in a part of Iowa that swung heavily from Barack Obama to Donald Trump four years ago. She quietly braced herself for yet another defeat. Months later, Biden is riding high in the polls and, if the numbers are to be believed, is on his way to a significant victory in three weeks to put an end to the most tumultuous presidency of modern times. Support for the former vice-president has surged in recent days as the White House lurches from crisis to disaster. Democrats are daring to hope they can put behind them the nightmare of losing an election four years ago that all the polls said Hillary Clinton was going to win. Biden is up to 16 points ahead nationally on the back of Trump’s antics in the most undignified presidential election debate in history and his cavalier attitude to other people’s health after he contracted coronavirus. Suddenly must-win states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin seem safe for Biden. States that looked to be just beyond his grasp, like Florida and Iowa, and maybe even Republican strongholds like Texas and Georgia, are competitive. But Hubka is not sure she does believe the polls. “I don’t want to believe any of them, and I don’t want anyone else to believe them either. I don’t want one person to stay home and not vote, like when they thought Hillary Clinton was 15 points ahead,” she said. “I do think that there’s a few people that may have been making excuses for Trump who feel a little more ashamed or a little more like they might vote for Joe Biden. But sitting where I live, I don’t feel like there’s a 14-, 15-point lead. He’s not ahead by that.” Poll after poll nevertheless says that Biden is in a commanding position with his numbers constantly pushed up by voters recoiling from Trump’s actions. A Franklin Pierce University survey in recent days showed that far from engendering sympathy, the president contracting Covid-19 precipitated a collapse in support. Days earlier, Biden held a five point lead over Trump. After the diagnosis, the former vice-president surged to 55% while the president fell back to just 34%. Other polls mirror those findings. Crucially, Biden has a 12-point lead among independent voters who will decide the election in key swing states. For all that, the political analyst Larry Sabato thinks Hubka is wise to be cautious. He said Biden’s position would be much weaker if not for the president’s chaotic and cavalier handling of a pandemic that has claimed 215,000 deaths and will probably take tens of thousands more by election day. But he said the polls do not reflect what will happen when the votes are counted. “He’s not winning by 14 or 16 points. Not a chance. We’re too polarized for that. What happened was a lot of Trump supporters became discouraged after the debate and after his hospitalization and simply wouldn’t participate in the polls. This has happened before. So I think Biden will win, probably by a healthy margin. But nothing like the current numbers suggest. It’s a sugar high,” said Sabato, director of the Center for Politics as the University of Virginia. Republican party election organizers recognized months ago that the election was shaping up as a referendum on Trump’s handling of coronavirus and he was not being judged favorably. Hubka acknowledges that without the pandemic, Biden would be struggling to compete with the president. “I absolutely do think if the stock market was still high and unemployment numbers were still at 3% it would have been more difficult for Joe Biden. His poll numbers would not be where they are,” she said. But Sabato said that while coronavirus has been key in Biden’s rise, it is not the only factor in an increasingly disastrous year for the president. “Covid changed everything. On January 1, most people in my field believed that Trump was the favorite. The economy was golden. He was the incumbent. He could take full credit the way incumbents always do, even if they had nothing to do with the economic engine. Democrats were discouraged,” said Sabato. “Then came the pandemic and the economic collapse. Then the police shootings of blacks, and the incredible irresponsibility of Donald Trump and his key associates which has resulted in a cell of Covid in the White House. The debate was a complete disaster for Trump. This is karma, some would say.” Trump’s attempts to delegitimize the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May helped drive younger voters toward Biden, a candidate few of them feel any great affinity with. Katybeth Davis lives in a blue-collar community just south of Detroit that swung heavily to Trump four years ago. That shift was instrumental in delivering Michigan to the president by just 10,704 votes, providing an important part of the electoral college that put him in the White House. Polls now put Biden eight points ahead in Michigan. “You see Biden signs all over the place now when you hardly saw any for Hillary,” said Davis, a 36 year-old construction company supervisor who describes herself as “super mixed-race”, including African, Native American and European ancestry.
Davis was drawn into political activism by the Black Lives Matter protests, a cause she said has done a lot more than the coronavirus to mobilize younger voters who did not engaged with politics before. “There is a huge surge in the younger voters participating, going into the lower income neighborhoods doing voter registration,” she said. “They see that everything we’ve worked for, a lot of social justice issues, are on the line with this election. We have a rightwing supreme court now. We could lose marriage equality. Women’s rights. The huge reason I believe that women are going for Joe now is because they realize that Roe v Wade is literally on the line. Immigration’s on the line. This is our diversity that’s on the line. This is racial equality, gender equality. This is literally every single value that we have.” Opinion polls show that not only are voters under 30 overwhelmingly more likely to back Biden but the number who say they will definitely vote is up to 63% from 47% four years ago, according to a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics poll. Biden also has a consistent and widening lead in another prize state, Florida. If he were to take it, that would almost certainly block any hope of Trump winning the election, although Biden is still doing worse with conservative Latinos there than his Democratic predecessors. Trump supporters routinely dismiss the increasingly alarming polls for their man as flawed or faked, and claim that Biden is doing no better than Clinton who was polling similar numbers and still lost. “It’s not true,” said Sabato. “Biden is doing much better than Clinton, mainly because he doesn’t stir the negative emotions that Hillary did. Some of it was just pure gender bias but a lot of it was with her personality, and dislike for the Clintons. So I think Biden is in a much better position. He’s relatively inoffensive.” Other underlying trends in the polls look good for Biden. There has been a significant shift to the former vice-president among older voters, some of them recoiling from Trump’s lack of respect for the decorum of his office. For the first time in at least two decades, a majority of voters over 65 back a Democrat for president with Biden winning 60% support. Women have also shifted to Biden in significant numbers. He commands a huge 27-point margin among female voters, nearly twice that for Clinton four years ago. Biden is even gaining among middle-aged men who overwhelmingly favoured Trump in 2016. Support among black voters is as strong as always for Democratic presidential candidates but the key will be turning out African Americans to the polls after they stayed home in large numbers when Clinton ran. All of this matters most in the handful of states that will decide the election. Wisconsin is among the most crucial after Obama’s significant majority there in 2012 vanished when Clinton lost the state by only about 23,000 votes even though the polls put her ahead by about six points. Now Biden is consistently five to 10 points in the lead. Charles Franklin, director of Wisconsin’s respected Marquette poll, said that is a reason to be cautious but there are important differences. For a start, the proportion of voters saying they are undecided in Wisconsin is about half that of 2016 so there is less room for Trump to pick up additional support. In addition, four years ago the polls showed a lot of people really didn’t like Clinton even if they didn’t like Trump either so many of them stayed at home. Biden is regarded much more favorably, making it easier to vote against Trump.
Franklin’s latest poll also shows an increased determination to vote this year, and that is likely to benefit Biden. “It suggests that we will be very close to a record for turnout in a presidential year when the state saw a fall in turnout in 2016,” he said. “Most of the drop-off in votes four years ago was on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton got close to 250,000 fewer votes than Obama got (against Mitt Romney in 2012). But Trump only barely exceeded Romney’s total. Given the way Democrats feel about President Trump, I don’t expect to see a similarly one-sided drop-off this year. I think Democrats generally are very positive to Joe Biden, but they are extraordinarily negative to Donald Trump. So in many ways, Trump is the Democrats’ greatest get-out-the-vote argument.” It is difficult to see how Trump overcomes any surge in turnout for Biden in Wisconsin and other swing states. While the president’s base remains loyal, he does not appear to be picking up significant numbers of new voters who have come on board because they are happy about the way things have gone over the past four years. Instead he is struggling to hold on to those he won over in 2016. As much as Hubka would liked to have seen her fellow Democrats chose a different presidential candidate, she thinks Biden turned out to be a fortuitous choice at time when significant numbers of voters appear to have retreated from their craving for change and now “just want an end to the crazy”. “I don’t find a lot of people jumping for joy that it’s Joe Biden but they’re glad that it’s him because they feel like he can win. He can reassure Republicans who want to get away from Trump. They know that he was with Obama and they can look at him and say, ‘At least he can fill this space and do the job and I can sleep at night, not wondering what crazy thing is going to happen next,’” said Hubka. Still, Americans are acutely aware that this is 2020 and there are more than three weeks to the polls, an eternity in a month that has already seen its share of political drama. Democrats see the president’s attempts to disrupt the election, such as his attacks on postal voting, as an implicit recognition that he is losing and only expect him to get more desperate. Trump’s calls to mobilise militias to ostensibly monitor the vote, which Democrats interpret as a call to intimidate voters in areas likely to back Biden, alarms Hubka. So does his endorsement of the white nationalist militias during the debate, particularly after the FBI exposed a rightwing militia plot to abduct the governor of Michigan.
It’s all part of a pattern of increasingly erratic behaviour, including Trump berating his own cabinet last week for not prosecuting his political enemies, that has Democrats on edge whatever the polls may say. “I feel a little more confident that Biden can win but we don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow or the next day,” said Hubka. “I’m fatigued. Every day I wake up worrying about what craziness Trump’s going to bring. I don’t know that I’ve ever felt this uneasy about all sorts of different things that are happening right now. I can’t get a good feel of it. It makes me nauseous, actually, just thinking of what’s he gonna do to win.” Davis is more relaxed. “I’m not nervous. I don’t think there’s anything that Trump could do right now that would save him. Even if he has a vaccine before the election. I don’t even think a big stimulus package is going to help either. To be honest, I think the Republicans have even come to terms with it. I just want it to be over with. I really do,” she said.

,,"Voters say no to Biden, but Joe is intent on finishing the (awful) job","   One of Donald Trump’s gifts is that he drives his enemies so crazy that they do really weird things. The latest evidence came Tuesday morning when Joe Biden released a three-minute video announcing he is seeking re-election.  The world’s a mess, America is spiraling downward at a rapid rate and Biden would be older than dirt at the end of a second term, but he wants to “finish the job.” Finish the job? Apparently not satisfied with merely damaging America, he aims to destroy it. The fact that the president made the announcement via a recording reflects White House concerns about his stumbling and bumbling cognitive defects. He can’t hold a press conference, submit to a tough interview or speak without a teleprompter, so fire up the video with a voice-over that can be rehearsed and repeated until he gets it right.  The leader of the free world is a captive of his own decline. But as every incompetent politician knows, you don’t have to fool all the people all the time, just half of those who vote. Biden’s been using Trump’s candidacy as a rationale for his own, arguing that he alone can defeat him, and cites 2020 as proof.  Naturally, then, his tiresome references about “MAGA extremists” and a “battle for the soul of the nation” were featured in the video as fear-mongering reminders that the other side remains a danger to motherhood, apple pie and … transgender rights. It’s a clever claim that only he can beat Trump but hardly a convincing one because, as Wall Street is required to say, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  And a lot has changed since 2020, most importantly that Biden now has a terrible record of his own to defend. His approval rating of around 40% in most polls is about where Trump stood when Biden defeated him. Biden also had the COVID-era advantage of being able to spend most of the last campaign in his basement, an option not likely to be available again.  Forced to meet and greet and speak coherently while barnstorming in swing states, his ­endurance will be tested and closely watched. Yet the Trump-killer claim is always front and center because, if you strip it away, it’s next to impossible to make any other credible case for four more years.  Start with the fact that even most of Biden’s fellow Democrats ­believe it’s time for him to say goodbye.  An AP-NORC poll in February found just 37% of registered Dems want him to run again, a dramatic decline from 57% who felt that way before last year’s midterms. The AP reported that, in follow-up interviews, respondents cited his age as a liability and were “focused on his coughing, his gait, his gaffes and the possibility that the world’s most stressful job would be better suited for someone younger.” Those are awfully damning findings, and they are not outliers. While it’s true that most Dems will come home for any nominee, especially if Trump is the GOP opponent, a good argument can be made that, for the good of the country, Biden should retire gracefully and pass the torch.  Recall that in 2020, he called himself a “transition” candidate, a phrase widely interpreted as meaning he would step aside for a new generation after one term.  Mark that down as another false note. No doubt he likes the perks and power, and Biden can be forgiven if he concludes, along with the rest of the world, that Vice President Kamala Harris can’t pick up the torch. Nor is there any other obvious successor in the party.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signaled his availability, but the response and reviews were underwhelming. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running as a primary opponent and his name guarantees him attention, but he’s not likely to be a serious threat to Biden getting the nomination.  Still, I believe there is another, hidden reason why the president is compelled to run again. He’s got to play defense against the GOP investigations into his family’s corrupt business schemes and there’s no better place to do that than in the White House.  It has armed guards and a fence around it and comes with press secretaries and cabinet members paid to answer questions and take the flak. You can always have someone say you’re too busy, even when you’re taking a nap or just eating ice cream. Biden needs all that protection because, apart from his frail health, the GOP probers already are hitting pay dirt on several fronts. Bank records they subpoenaed show at least nine members of his family getting money from the multimillion-dollar deal with a Chinese energy conglomerate.  This is the same deal in which Joe was identified as the “big guy” slated to get a secret 10% cut.  Did the president get the money? If he did, the GOP will find it. And then we’ll know for certain why he’s been so soft with China. Moreover, the emergence of an IRS whistleblower who claims that Hunter Biden is getting preferential treatment from the IRS and the Department of Justice and that Attorney General Merrick Garland lied to Congress about the case adds new degrees of legitimacy to the probe and thus peril to the president.  Then there’s the role of Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who as a Biden campaign aide in 2020 helped inspire the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials suggesting that the first Post scoops on Hunter Biden’s laptop were a form of Russian disinformation. The letter was the actual disinformation and the fruit of a Deep State conspiracy and was dutifully magnified by a lapdog media. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.   We also know now that Blinken met with Hunter Biden when the then-vice president’s son was on the board of Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian energy company. If Blinken is summoned by House Republicans and put under oath, he could deliver a mother lode of problems for the first family. I believe those developments, whatever Joe Biden’s preference, left him no option except to run again. They may even have dictated the timing of his announcement.  Each passing day that he didn’t announce would have led to questions about whether he was going to. And that would generate talk that he was afraid to face voters again. Not running also would have made him an instant lame duck and it would be open season on him and his family. Even congressional Dems wouldn’t have the same gusto for defending him, and the party would be concentrated on 2024 instead of defending something the Bidens did four, five or six years ago. So running is his best defense, letting him keep control of the party and the ability to reward and punish individual members of Congress. There are lots of ways for a president seeking re-election to convey a demand for support, such as, “Do you want that damaged bridge in your district repaired or not?” Merely by announcing, then, Biden buys time, keeps everybody on the left in line, including the Dem-friendly media outlets. They’re not likely to pursue the family corruption angle with any vigor if they believe it would lead to the election of Trump.  Of course, the former president’s path back to the Oval Office is not a smooth one, either. Although the partisan indictment by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is too clever by half, it’s just the start of a legal gauntlet Trump faces.  Three other criminal probes are ongoing and he faces a civil trial in federal court in New York over a claim he raped a former magazine writer nearly three decades ago. Testimony started Tuesday in the case in which the alleged victim, E. Jean Carroll, also claims Trump defamed her.  Nonetheless, the 76-year-old Trump is now stronger in the GOP than he was three months ago and there is a growing belief he will win the nomination. Several polls show him getting near 70% support, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis a distant second. That means, for now, a Biden-Trump rematch looks likely. Depending on your point of view, it’s going to be either a monumental clash of titans or a rerun of the ­retreads.

,,"U.S. Voters: Biden, Most in House Don't Deserve Another Term","WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fewer than four in 10 U.S. registered voters say President Joe Biden deserves to be reelected, while less than a quarter say the same about most members of the U.S. House. As is almost always the case, voters are more inclined to believe the U.S. representative from their own district should be returned to Congress, with 55% holding that view. These results are based on a Jan. 2-22 Gallup poll. The 38% of voters who say Biden deserves a second term is slightly lower than the 41% of Americans who approve of the job he is doing in the same survey. Voters are somewhat more willing to say Biden should be returned to office now than they were when Gallup last asked the question in June 2022 (33%), leading up to that year’s midterm elections. As would be expected, the vast majority of Democratic registered voters (82%) versus few Republican voters (3%) believe Biden should be reelected. At 29%, independent voters’ support for a second Biden term is much closer to that of Republicans than Democrats. Independents are the least likely party group to believe most members of Congress, and their own member, deserve to be reelected. Less than half of independents say their own representative should receive another term, compared with more than six in 10 Republicans and Democrats. In January of prior incumbent reelection years, Gallup asked whether former Presidents Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush deserved reelection. The same question was asked about George W. Bush (October 2003) and Barack Obama (December 2011) late in the years before they sought reelection. Of these, the younger Bush (who won reelection) had the highest reelect figure, at 53%, while two incumbents who lost, Trump at 50% and the elder Bush at 49%, scored just below. Although Biden’s current rating ranks lowest among the readings for the past six presidents, his 38% is most similar to Clinton’s 44% and Obama’s 43%, both of whom won a second term. Biden can take some solace in the fact that voter sentiment about whether a president deserves reelection has often changed over the course of prior election years. After receiving subpar reelection support early on, Obama and Clinton saw significant improvement, resulting in election wins: Conversely, two presidents saw their promising early readings dwindle between January and Election Day, to the point that they lost their reelection bids: The younger Bush’s reelection figures hovered around the 50% mark in three surveys leading up to the 2004 election, before he won a second term. Today’s congressional reelection figures are also lower than is typical for early readings in presidential election years. Slightly fewer U.S. registered voters in 2012 and 2016 thought their local representative deserved to be reelected than do now, but 60% or more did so in other years. The 24% who believe most members deserve reelection is lower than in all recent presidential election years except 2012, when 20% held that view in the late 2011 survey. The current figure is similar to that from 2016, but in all other years, 35% or more thought most members should be reelected, including a majority of 56% in 2000. Voters’ opinions of whether members of Congress deserve reelection have usually not changed much over the course of presidential election years. There have been exceptions, though -- as in 1992, when voters became much less inclined to want to reelect members, and in 2012, when there were modest increases in incumbent reelection sentiments. Voters are not enthusiastic about returning most elected federal officials to office. Biden trails other incumbents at similar points in their presidencies, and voters are less likely than in other recent election years to say members of Congress deserve reelection. While the numbers for Congress are unlikely to improve, based on historical patterns, Biden’s numbers could. He hopes to follow the paths of Clinton and Obama, whose electoral fortunes improved during their reelection years and saw them win second terms, rather than those of Trump and the elder George Bush, whose support for a second term deteriorated over the course of the election year.

,,Will Bernie voters vote for Biden when he wins?,"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week The establishment candidate is once again cruising to the Democratic nomination — which raises a familiar question about Bernie Sanders' insurgents One month out from the Iowa caucuses, the race for the Democratic nomination looks remarkably stable. Joe Biden is solidly in the lead, Bernie Sanders is roughly nine points behind him, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have faded, and Michael Bloomberg is blowing through wads of cash in order to stay inches ahead of Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. The dynamics of the race have been consistent at the top for more than a year now. Unless something changes soon, Biden is going to prevail. Which means that Sanders will not. And that could be a major problem for the party. Will Sanders supporters be willing (for the second time in as many presidential election cycles) to hold their noses and turn out to vote in November for a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party establishment when the socialist to whom they're so passionately devoted falls short of victory? Or will they be inclined (in much greater numbers than they did in 2016) to stay home or support someone's third-party bid from the left in a deliberate attempt to sink a party for which they have burning contempt? Those questions are going to become increasingly important as events unfold over the next few months. Subscribe for less than $2.50 per week with digital access and free home delivery. Of course, the opposite could also become a problem. If Biden sinks and Sanders somehow manages to rise above 20 percent in the polls (he hasn't been higher than that since last April) and ultimately win the nomination, the more moderate voters backing Biden will need to decide if they can stomach casting a ballot for the most left-wing candidate ever to become a major party nominee. But there is one very important difference between Biden and Sanders voters. The former are supporting the former vice president primarily because they think he is well-poised to win in a general-election contest against Trump. There's very little sign of fervent devotion to Biden as a person or a candidate. This indicates pragmatic flexibility that may be compatible with rallying behind another nominee, even if he's a socialist promising $97 trillion in new government spending. The same cannot be said for Sanders supporters, who are uncompromisingly devoted to the Vermont senator and passionately committed to undertaking what he breathlessly describes as a “political revolution.” The Atlantic's Derek Thompson is right to suggest that these millennial (and younger) voters effectively constitute a third, firmly left-wing party in American politics. This party is happy to turn out for the Democrats so long as Sanders is its nominee. But if it's bumbling, stumbling Biden — a man who served for eight years as a right-hand man to a lukewarm, moderate president after decades of representing a state (Delaware) dominated by credit card companies — well, then all bets are off. (Even if you believe polls that show a decent number of Bernie voters would shift to Biden as their second choice, this would still leave an awful lot of unhappy and homeless Sanders supporters around to stir up trouble.) It would be one thing if 2016 had never happened. But it did, and many of Bernie's supporters feel like they got burned badly by the Democratic establishment not once but twice four years ago. First, their hopes were raised by Sanders' surprising success across the country and then dashed by his inability to overcome Hillary Clinton's strong institutional support. Then they settled for Clinton as a consolation prize in order to defeat Donald Trump in the general election only to have her lose to him. As far as they're concerned, they've been fooled two times already. It's passion that explains Sanders' incredible success at fundraising — with $34.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, a number that is likely to dwarf everyone else's in the race. It's even more impressive when we factor in the Sanders campaign's emphasis on collecting small donations. That shows a lot of devotion by a lot of people. So far there's no sign that it's enough people to win the race for the nomination. But it would be more than enough to torpedo Democrats' chances of taking down Trump in November. Will Sanders (an independent who only calls himself a Democrat when he's running for president) urge his supporters once again to back the Democratic nominee, even if it's Biden? And even if he does, will those supporters go along with such an unrevolutionary act of sail-trimming? That would be the real test of whether Sanders is leading a cult of his own personality or a genuine, ideologically galvanized movement that will outlast his leadership and continue to influence the shape of American politics going forward. A movement firmly committed to bringing about the scale of changes Sanders has been advocating wouldn't hesitate to “heighten the contradictions” — that is, allow things to get worse in the short term (by acting in a way that helps Trump to win a second term) in the hope that better long-term prospects for progress (namely, a big shift to the left in the electorate) would emerge from the mess. If nothing else, a second loss to Trump would ensure the overthrow of the establishment that has led the Democratic Party since 1992, thereby opening up the prospect of its takeover by left-wing populists by 2024. As I've pointed out before, the Democratic electoral coalition is extremely broad, and perhaps too broad for its own good. A party that's big enough to include everyone from socialist Bernie Sanders to liberal Republican Michael Bloomberg is a party that will struggle to find a single standard-bearer who can unite its disparate factions. It might even be a party poised to shatter into its constituent parts. The Sanders campaign may well end up being the catalyst that prompts the detonation.

,,"Young Black Americans not sold on Biden, the Democrats or voting","Photo by Hill Street Studios/Getty Images. Most political analysts define “swing voters” as those who swing their support from one party to the other between election cycles – determining winners and losers in the process. According to this conventional wisdom, the “swingiest” voters are working-class whites in the Midwest, who supposedly hold the keys to the White House. Meanwhile, by contrast, pundits often portray Black Americans as an undifferentiated mass – loyal Democrat-supporting foot soldiers who will execute their mission for The Team on Tuesday as long as some preacher provides the right marching orders on Sunday. If these depictions have not already expired, they are certainly growing stale. Having studied electoral trends for decades, we can tell you that those undecided voters of the past are an endangered species – in the Midwest and elsewhere. These days, the only choice that most Americans make – indeed, the choice that typically “swings” the election outcome — is whether to vote at all. That brings us to the characterization of Black Americans as Democratic loyalists. Our new survey of 1,215 African Americans in battleground states – Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia – reveals that while those over 60 remain among the most reliable of Democratic voters, and those between 40-59 are still pretty locked in as well, those under 30 (whom we oversampled to comprise half of our sample) are anything but. Only 47% of those Black Americans under 30 years old that we surveyed plan to vote for the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. That’s roughly the same percentage who have anything positive to say when asked what “one or two words come to mind” about the former vice president. Cathy Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who studies Black youths’ political views, summed up this attitude in a recent podcast: “They’ve seen the election of Black mayors, they’ve seen the election of the first Black president, and they’ve also seen that their lives have not changed.”  These young Black Americans may well sit things out in November, just as many of them did in 2016 when their behavior swung that election to Trump as much as anything else did. In our poll, 31% of Black Americans under 30 say they probably won’t vote in this election. That may sound pretty good, given the average U.S. voter turnout of around 60% in recent elections. But survey respondents of all stripes tend to wildly overestimate their intention to vote. Indeed, about half of our Black survey respondents under 30 say they don’t often vote because it “doesn’t make a difference,” providing a somewhat more realistic estimate of the percentage who will probably just stay home – and not search for a stamp to mail in their ballot, either. And that number does not even take into account the turnout-depressing effects of voter suppression efforts taking place across the country, the pandemic or the heavy distrust of mail-in voting that young Black people tend to express. Only 64% of young people in our sample say they trust the state to report their vote accurately, and only 30% say they plan to take advantage of mail-in voting. Such cynicism on the part of young Black Americans is reflected in the lukewarm feelings they tend to have toward the Democratic Party more generally. Only 47% of them say that the party is welcoming to Black Americans, and only 43% say they trust Democrats in Congress to do what’s best for the Black community. Perhaps most strikingly, unlike their older counterparts, only half of those under 30 view the Democrats as any better than the Republicans on these scores. In both the survey responses and in the focus groups we conducted of young Black Americans in these same states, we heard repeated frustration toward what they view as a Democratic Party that expects their vote but doesn’t really do anything to deserve it other than claim to be “less racist” than the alternative. As one of our focus group respondents put it, “I think at the end of the day, they all have the same agenda.” In short, it appears that for Black America, the future is not necessarily “blue.” Electorally speaking, it is not necessarily anything at all. Moving forward, young Black Americans may be the real “swing voters” in the only way that term really makes much sense anymore. David C.

,,Trump claims premature victory as vote count continues: Live news,"Joe Biden addresses supporters as election results continue to roll in. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Hello and welcome to Al Jazeera’s continuing coverage of the US elections. This is Shereena Qazi, taking over from Joseph Stepansky. The outcome of the presidential elections will have little effect on US-Europe trade relations, France’s finance chief asserted, saying Washington is unlikely to drop its confrontational stance whether Trump wins or not.      The US administration has inflicted billions of dollars’ worth of tariffs on European imports over the past four years, with Trump claiming unfair barriers against American firms trying to compete on continental markets. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has repeated his country’s stance on the US presidential race, saying it is not important who wins but what actions the next president takes towards sanctions on Iran. “What is important for us is that America returns to respecting the Iranian nation. We want respect instead of sanctions, no matter who is [in office]. If he lifts the unfair and illegal sanctions and replaces them with respect, then our situation will be different,” Rouhani said in a televised speech. 4 Nov 2020 - 12:32 GMT German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warns the US is facing a “very explosive situation” and a possible systemic crisis after Trump prematurely declared election victory. Following Trump’s remarks that he will go to the Supreme Court to stop ballots from being tallied, Kramp-Karrenbauer told public broadcaster ZDF: “This election has not been decided … votes are still being counted.” She said Trump could create “a constitutional crisis in the USA”, calling such a scenario “something that must deeply concern us”. Despite incomplete results from several battleground states that could determine the outcome of the US presidential race, Trump prematurely claimed victory over Biden. The move confirmed worries that Trump would seek to dispute the election results. Read more here about the different ways the election can be contested. The Associated Press news agency has not declared a winner in Wisconsin’s presidential contest because the race between Trump and Biden is too early to call. Trump, who is locked in a tight battle with Biden to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win, prematurely claimed early on Wednesday that he was “winning” the state. Biden is ahead of Trump by fewer than 8,000 votes out of nearly 3.2 million cast. Gold fell more than 1 percent as the dollar emerged as the favoured safe haven from a much closer presidential race than investors expected following Trump’s strong performance in some swing states.  Spot gold fell 1.1 percent to $1,887.76 an ounce by 11:02 GMT. US gold futures dropped 1.2 percent to $1,888. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against major currencies. Chinese social media users watched election day in the US with bemusement and mockery, as Trump complained of a “major fraud on our nation” and prematurely claimed victory. “Whether he wins or loses, his final mission is to destroy the appearance of American democracy,” one user on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform wrote. “Let Trump be re-elected and take the US downhill,” another wrote. Relations between China and the US are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong and the coronavirus, and the Trump administration has unleashed a barrage of sanctions against Beijing. Biden’s campaign manager called Trump’s call for vote counting to stop “outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect”. “It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” said Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon. “It was unprecedented because never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election. “And it was incorrect because it will not happen. The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted.” The AP news agency issued a bulletin saying it is not calling the presidential race yet, despite Trump’s claims of victory, because neither candidate has secured the 270 electoral college votes needed to win. Speaking from the White House at 02:30 ET, Trump said: “Frankly, we did win this election.”  The president said he would go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of mail ballots. “His assertion of victory does not match the results and information currently available to the AP,” the news service reported. Several key states are too early to call, including Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan the agency said. Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland has sent this report from Tucson, Arizona. Democrat Mark Kelly has won a US Senate seat for Arizona, beating Republican Martha McSally for the seat once held by Senator John McCain, who died in August 2018. “Tonight is not about celebrating, tonight is about getting to work,” Kelly told a small crowd in Tucson earlier in the evening. He spoke about the hardships Arizonans have faced owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying many small businesses are in peril in the southwest state. The Democrat leader said he would strive for policies to set back Trump’s crackdown on immigration, lowering healthcare costs and the need to “rebuild the economy – and it’s going to be a massive undertaking”. A centrist Democrat and former astronaut, Kelly first opened a large lead over McSally as the vote counting got under way in the southwest state.   4 Nov 2020 - 08:05 GMT Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Raleigh, North Carolina. At 2:30am (07:30 GMT), the presidential race in North Carolina was still too close to call. Trump was leading Biden by about 76,700 votes, with 95 percent of expected votes counted. According to the State Board of Elections, roughly 117,000 absentee ballots have not yet been returned. Those ballots, if postmarked by Election Day, can still be counted if they arrive by November 12. The close race did not stop Trump from prematurely declaring “a big win in North Carolina” during televised remarks early on Wednesday morning. Democrat Mark Kelly defeats Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency. Democratic presidential Biden and senate candidate Kelly have been declared the winners in Arizona, according to the AP news agency. The win gives Biden 11 votes in the Electoral College that Trump had won in 2016. Cindy McCain, the widow of late Senator John McCain, a Republican, had endorsed Biden. Biden got strong support from voters in the Phoenix area, Maricopa County, where the majority of the state’s population resides. Read more here 4 Nov 2020 - 07:46 GMT President Trump prematurely claims victory in the presidential election, before vote counting has ended, and suggested Democrats were engaged in fraud as key states continued to count hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump said in remarks from the White House. Trump claimed he is winning in key states – Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin – that have just begun to count mail ballots likely to favour Biden.

Democratic US Senator Tina Smith defeats Republican Jason Lewis in Minnesota’s US Senate race, according to the AP. Trump has won Texas and its 38 electoral votes. Omar has won a second term in the Congress Minnesota’s 5th congressional district in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Omar, 38, defeated her Republican challenger, African American businessman Lacy Johnson, by 64.6 percent of the vote to 25.9 percent, according to the AP news agency with 99 percent of votes counted.

He also predicted a “big” win for himself. We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020 Twitter labelled his tweet as making a “potentially misleading claim about an election”.
Trump’s tweets came immediately after a statement from Biden, who said he was optimistic about his prospects of winning. Biden spoke from Delaware shortly after midnight, saying he is optimistic he is going to win the US presidential election. “We knew this was going to go long … but look, we feel good about where we are. We believe we are on track to win this election,” Biden said. “It ain’t over ‘til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted. “We are confident about Arizona … We’re also just calling for Minnesota and we are still in the game in Georgia … And we are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan … We are going to win in Pennsylvania. Keep the faith guys, we are going to win this.”   Shortly after Biden gave an election night speech, Trump tweeted he would speak tonight. Florida and its 29 electoral votes were a must-win for Trump. If he wound up losing there, it would have significantly narrowed his path to 270 electoral votes. Early indications are that Trump, although losing Miami-Dade, the most populous county in Florida, improved his vote total there, from 2016. Florida political experts are crediting Trump’s improvement with Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade with helping him to victory. At the beginning of the evening, we listed Florida as one of the “super seven” states that if Biden flipped early on, it would have signalled a potentially clear path for him. The other six states on that list – Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Arizona and Iowa – are still too close to call. Biden’s clear path is much muddier now after Florida lands in Trump’s column. Our analysis still holds true: If Biden can win two of those six, especially two large states, it makes it that much more difficult for Trump to hit 270. But given the close counts in those other states, as well as the other Trump 2016 states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – we are in for an extremely long night or, perhaps, another long day tomorrow waiting for final results. Read more here The AP has called Montana and Iowa for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump 9 more electoral votes. The AP has called Ohio for the Republican Party, giving Trump 18 electoral votes. Biden is set to speak at 00:30 ET from Wilmington, Delaware, according to his campaign. While key Democratic-leaning cities like Detroit, Michigan and Philadelphia have halted counting, Trump’s team “have started to feel optimistic given the fact that they went into this knowing that Joe Biden had a substantial lead”. Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont filed this report from Pennsylvania On Election Night, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said counting the state’s millions of ballots will take time and asked voters to be patient. Voters returned a record-breaking 2.5 million mail ballots across the state, but by law, it could not start counting them until the morning of Election Day. “Counting that tremendous number of ballots will, again, take longer than we’re used to, but the extra time is just there because we want to make sure our election system is working and that each and every vote is counted,” Wolf said. “We may not know the results today, as a result, but I encourage all of us to take a deep breath and, as I’ve been saying, just be patient. What’s most important is that we have accurate results and that every vote is counted, even if that takes a little longer.” The AP news agency has called Minnesota for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 10 more electoral votes. The AP news agency has called Hawaii for the Democratic Party, giving Biden four more electoral votes. 4 Nov 2020 - 04:44 GMT Reynolds, reporting from Los Angeles, says Arizona could be one of the surprises of the night. “It has not been called yet, but it’s looking good for Joe Biden,” Reynolds said. “And this is extraordinary because Arizona is formerly a rock-ribbed Republican state … it hasn’t gone for a Democratic President since … 1996.” Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer filed this report from Kenosha, Wisconsin As polls close in Wisconsin, a local pizzeria is ground zero for Kenosha’s Republicans. Complete with Fox News streaming across two televisions and a cardboard cutout of the president at the door, a long table filled with various pies bisects the mask-less crowd watching the earliest results roll in. Sheila Dissmore, 57, opted to vote in person on Tuesday. “Being a full-blown patriot, I feel like it’s just extra special voting on [election] day,” she says. “Just seeing how raw and unedited the president I think is refreshing.” Living on Kenosha’s south side with her 92-year-old father through the pandemic, this summer’s civil unrest caused Dissmore to double down on her Republican beliefs. “For the first time in my life, having to lock my door, close the shutters, close everything, turn the drapes and having my father there – I’m not a gun owner, but I wish I was.” Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith has defeated Democrat Mike Espy in Mississippi’s Senate race, according to the AP news agency. Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock will advance to a runoff in Georgia’s special US Senate election, the AP projects. Since no candidate in the 21-candidate field received 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters will face off on January 5, with the winner being sworn in immediately thereafter. It is projected Loeffler edged out Republican US Representative Doug Collins to land in the top two. This is significant in that the Republicans’ Senate majority may hang in the balance until January if neither is able to claim a majority after the rest of tonight’s races are projected.      Worth noting as we wait for the final projection on too-close-to-call North Carolina: Biden had not visited the state since October 18, making it one of the few key battlegrounds where he did not campaign in the final sprint. His running mate Kamala Harris did make four stops over two days in that period. For his part, Trump made five visits to North Carolina between October 21 and Election Day. Republican Roger Marshall has defeated Democrat Barbara Bollier in Kansas’s Senate race. Republican Senator James Risch has defeated Democrat Paulette Jordan in Idaho’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley has defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins in Oregon’s Senate race. The AP has called Utah for the Republican Party, giving Donald Trump six more electoral votes. 4 Nov 2020 - 04:05 GMT AP has called New Hampshire for the Democratic Party, giving Joe Biden four more electoral votes. The AP calls Idaho for the Republican Party, giving Trump four more electoral votes. The AP has called California, Oregon and Washington state for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 74 more electoral votes. It is 23:00 ET (04:00 GMT) and the last polls have closed in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this report The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said there have been no serious voting issues in the state. “I’m happy to report that today’s election in the Commonwealth went remarkably smoothly,” she told reporters. “We have no major or widespread events to report … No reports of violence at any polling places today,” Boockvar added. “There were a few reports of voters feeling intimidated that were resolved by calls to the counties.” Overall, Boockvar said her team at the voter information hotline answered 5,000 calls, mostly standard issues such as late-opening polls and lines at some polling stations. Other reported issues included: an individual accidentally shooting himself in Northampton County and then driving himself to the hospital; a volunteer with the Pennsylvania Democrats being shot with a paintball gun from a moving vehicle. Boockvar said this happened right before the polls closed, without elaborating. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit on behalf of Spanish-speaking voters who were not provided language access in York, Pennsylvania.   Texas “is still pretty close”, Zhou-Castro reported from Houston, Texas. “Normally by this time of night on election night pundits would have called Texas already for the Republican candidate,” She said “[But the fact that] votes are coming in and Joe Biden is still within reach of overtaking Trump … is making headlines in the state.”    The AP has called Missouri for the Republican Party, giving Trump 10 more electoral votes. “This state plays a huge role in presidential elections … Donald Trump looks like he is forging ahead in this state potentially with an even wider lead than he had over Hillary Clinton,” Gallacher reported from Miami Florida. “Donald Trump really does need to win this, the largest of all the battleground states, with 29 electoral college votes.” He added that Biden “has other options to the White House including places like Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, but at the moment we are getting pretty close to this state being called.” “There is some pressure now from the Trump campaign for officials to call it, and they already tweeted out ‘Trump has won Florida’, but that is not official yet … [but] it does look like Donald Trump may take Florida which is what he actually needs to do,” he said.   Not unexpectedly, Republican Tommy Tuberville has been projected as the winner of the US Senate race in Alabama, defeating Doug Jones. Tuberville, a former college football coach, was significantly outraised by Jones, but Alabama is a deeply Republican state and the outcome wasn’t in question. Jones won a special election in 2017 to replace Republican Jeff Sessions, who resigned his seat to become Trump’s attorney general. Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore, who had faced allegations of sexual misconduct. Moore ran against Tuberville and others in the Republican primary this year, but to the relief of Republicans, Tuberville won the nomination setting them on the path to reclaim the seat. 4 Nov 2020 - 03:15 GMT Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been re-elected for a second term in the US House of Representatives. The rising star in the Democratic Party was easily re-elected in New York’s 14th congressional district. Ocasio-Cortez made history in 2018 as the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history at the age of 28, championing her working-class and Puerto Rican roots. She is the daughter of a cleaner and a father who died in his 40s.  Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman progressive Democratic congresswomen that includes Rashida Tlaib from Detroit, Ilhan Omar from Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley from Boston. The four represent a new emerging faction of young, progressive politicians who are pushing the established House leadership of the Democratic Party.   South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham survived a re-election scare defeating well-funded Democrat Jaime Harrison. Democrats were extremely encouraged by the polls last month showing Harrison making the race much more competitive than expected in deeply Republican South Carolina. But pro-Trump Graham, who as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee shepherded Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, was able to pull out a victory tonight. The AP has called Kansas for the Republican Party giving Trump six more electoral votes. It is 22:00 ET (03:00GMT) and the polls have closed in Montana, Utah, Nevada and Iowa. Democrat John Hickenlooper defeated Republican Senator Cory Gardner in Colorado’s US Senate race, according to a projection from the Associated Press news agency. This is the first Republican Senate seat picked up by the Democrats tonight in their quest to take control of the Senate. Currently, Republicans have a 53-47 majority. Democrats need to net three seats to take over the Senate if Joe Biden wins the presidency, or four if Trump wins. The vice president is the tie-breaking vote and if Biden wins, Kamala Harris would be the tiebreaker in a 50-50 Senate. If Trump wins, Mike Pence would be the tie-breaking vote if the Senate ends up 50-50. “There is silence out of the Biden camp at the moment,” said Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna from Wilmington, Delaware. “All are simply watching the results and the ongoing analysis of what is happening, but nobody is breaking cover at the moment, the situation is so close, so absolutely tense in a number of states, that nobody wants to come up and make any calls at this particular point in time.” “Joe Biden said it very clearly early on in the afternoon that when he got something to say, he will come out and he will say it and very clearly this instruction has gone down to his staff, we heard very little from the Biden campaign headquarters… We understand that Joe Biden himself is still at his home here in Wilmington, Delaware in a few hours time he will come to the convention centre with his vice president nominee Kamala Harris,” he said. The AP has called Colorado for the Democratic Party, giving Biden nine more electoral votes. Al Jazeera’s Kristen Saloomey, reporting from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania said the state is in for a long count. “The polls have only just closed in Pennsylvania and in addition to all of the ballots that were cast today, the state now has to count some two and a half million mail-in ballots, and that is only just beginning that process … which can only begin on election day by Pennsylvania law,” she said. “So this could take a while, officials are predicting it might be before the end of the week before we have really clear results, but it’s interesting to point out that Democrats returned nearly three times as many mail-in ballots as Republicans did that’s maybe why President Trump has been very worried about those mail-in ballots,” she said. “He has been attempting to discredit or delegitimise those mail-in ballots, so we had an issue earlier in the day where a judge expressed concern about some missing mail-in ballots and has ordered about two dozens mail processing centres to be searched for possible missing ballots.” People across the United States have voted in one of the most polarising presidential elections in the country’s history – and the race is also playing out on social media. The #Vote2020 and #ElectionDay hashtags are trending in most countries on Twitter, as the world closely follows the hard-fought matchup between Trump and Biden on Tuesday. Read more here. Trying to balance out all that #ElectionDay stress eating…pic.twitter.com/zU9wlM30kg — Sierra Club (@SierraClub) November 3, 2020    The AP has called the District of Columbia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three more electoral votes. The governor of Pennsylvania has confirmed the vote count in the battleground state will take longer than expected, amid a surge in mail-in voting. Pennsylvania does not start counting mail voting until Election Day and will accept ballots postmarked by November 3 for three days after. Some districts have said they will not start counting mail votes until Wednesday morning.  Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this report from Graham, North Carolina The message on Election Night in Graham, where police pepper-sprayed protesters just three days before, was one of outrage and urgency – but also of hope and love. Led by Reverend Greg Drumwright, hundreds of people from across North Carolina marched quietly several blocks to two polling locations, before making their way to the central square, where a Confederate monument stands. “In the absence of hope, what do we have?” Drumwright told the crowd as they raised their fists in the air. “Therefore we cling to hope tonight,” he added. “I want you to cling to change tonight; I want you to believe that this is a shifting and a turning and a dawning of a new area; that things will not stay the same; that white supremacy will come down; that racism will come down; that love will be lifted up.” The marchers’ cheers drowned out the taunting by a small group of counterprotesters who gathered with confederate and Trump flags across the square. A judge in Nevada has ordered 30 Las Vegas-area voting sites to stay open for an extra hour tonight after a lawsuit was filed by Trump’s campaign and state Republicans. They had argued that 22 polling places did not open on time, and wanted the time extended. Lawyers for Democrats then requested that eight additional sites also stay open later. The judge granted both requests and said anyone in line at 8pm local time (04:00 GMT) would be allowed to cast a ballot. The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada shared a list of the Clark County polling sites that will stay open later. 🗳️🗳️ TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO VOTE 🗳️🗳️ Some Clark County polling locations have added an hour of voting tonight. Check out the full list and get in line to vote at these locations by 8 p.m. pic.twitter.com/X3C0XZXfk8 — ACLU of Nevada (@ACLUNV) November 4, 2020  Republican US Senator Ben Sasse has defeated Democrat Chris Janicek in Nebraska’s US Senate race. Republican US Senator Mike Rounds has defeated Democrat Daniel Ahlers in South Dakota’s US Senate race. Republican Cynthia Lummis has defeated Democrat Merav Ben-David in Wyoming’s US Senate race. The AP has called Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming for the Republican Party, giving Trump 21 more electoral votes. The AP has called New Mexico and New York for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 34 more electoral votes. It is 21:00 ET (02:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 4 Nov 2020 - 01:55 GMT Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Glendale, Arizona Early on Tuesday afternoon voters came in and out of Glendale Community College, not spending more than a few minutes inside the polling station. Glendale, 18km (11 miles) northwest of downtown Phoenix, sits in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous county. Volunteers instructed voters where to go as they arrived at the community college’s student union. “Thank you for voting,” the volunteers said as voters left. Blake Spanko, 22, wore a “Keep America Great – Trump 2020” hat and said he also voted for Trump in 2016. “I voted for him in 2016 just because he’s a smart businessman,” he told Al Jazeera. “I figured if he can make billions of dollars he can run a country successfully – and I think he did that.” Describing himself as a “traditional Christian”, Spanko said abortion was another important issue that drove him to cast his vote for Trump again. “I think [Arizona] will stay red,” Spanko added when asked whether he believed the battleground state could give its 11 electoral votes to a Democratic nominee for the first time since 1996. Another voter Michael, who declined to share his surname, said he voted “against Trump” whom he feels has spread hatred. “I definitely am against hatred and I was raised to be kind,” he said. Speaking to Al Jazeera by telephone, Democratic legislator Cesar Chavez, who represents legislative district 29 in the Arizona House of Representatives, said his party was confident it would outperform Republicans on Tuesday. “I don’t think we’ve felt any better than we do,” he said. “Really, this is a work in progress for the last 50 years.” In the parking lot outside Glendale Community College, pro-Trump activists handed out fliers that said “Keep America Great – 2020” and signs reading “Latinos for Trump”. The AP called Indiana for the Republican Party, giving Trump 11 more electoral votes. Iranian American progressive Sima Ladjevardian has lost her congressional race with staunchly conservative House Republican Dan Crenshaw, according to The Associated Press news agency. Ladjevardian had garnered national attention while encapsulating the shifting demographics in the one-time Republican bastion of Texas. Crenshaw and Ladjevardian were competing to represent the state’s 2nd congressional district, which includes parts of Houston. Ladjevardian was born in Iran and immigrated to the United States as a child. She is running to represent Texas’s 2nd congressional district. Read more here. The AP calls Arkansas for the Republican Party, giving Trump six more electoral votes. Republican Senator Tom Cotton wins Arkansas’ Senate race, according to The Associated Press news agency. 4 Nov 2020 - 01:28 GMT Former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway tells US broadcaster ABC News that several hundred people will be at the White House and that President Trump will address the nation “tonight” from the East Room. NEW: Kellyanne Conway tells @GStephanopoulos, ""You will hear from the president tonight…The president is expected to address the nation later from the East Room of the White House."" https://t.co/GwwRl4EUb3 #ElectionNight pic.twitter.com/YGL8Ghx8Lz — ABC News (@ABC) November 4, 2020  While several non-competitive states have been called already, winners have not been projected yet in any of the competitive battleground states whose polls have closed. Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are all too close to call, per the Associated Press news agency. Trump won all but New Hampshire in 2016. And there are some signs in the exit polls and the vote count that show some early positive signs for Trump and Biden in different states. In Florida, Trump is keeping Biden’s margin of victory down in Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county. In North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls suggest Biden is receiving more support among suburban voters than Trump did in 2016. The Associated Press, which is one of several US media organization making calls, waits until a significant number of votes have been counted, while also analysing exit polling data, in competitive states before they make projections. Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from New Hanover County  Trump supporters in North Carolina were energised at polling stations across the beach town of Wilmington. They were confident New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located, and the state will go red. “Trump has done a lot,” Char Marker said. “He’s done a lot of things to tackle our child sex trafficking problem that we have, which is huge to me. “I am a pro-life voter. And, you know, Trump has been one of the most pro-life presidents we’ve had yet. They say Trump is kind of like a party of his own. And if that’s the case, I’m in that party.” Across town, 22-year-old Brandon Panameno said he voted for Trump because he is not the “typical politician”. “The economy has been doing well” under Trump, he said. “I think he has a pretty good chance of winning again.” Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from rural Kenosha county, Wisconsin In rural Kenosha, Trump signs abound but not everyone is on board. In the village of Bristol, in central Kenosha county, a short line of voters are waiting to enter Bristol Village Hall where voting booths are delineated by yellow and orange traffic cones strung together with yellow rope. Tony Chacon, who moved to Bristol nine years ago from Kenosha, had just completed voting. “It’s better over here on this side of the Interstate. I feel a lot safer,” the 26-year-old said. “I’m in trade work so I’m big on keeping work in the United States,” he told Al Jazeera of his decision to vote for Trump. “He’s a businessman … someone who knows how money moves and how to move it,” said Chacon. For him, when Biden was vice president, “things were getting rough when it comes to prices of fuel.” He added that ultimately “our choices aren’t really the best” before turning to greet fellow Bristol resident, Brian Chwaszczewski, 33, who had also just voted. While he was reluctant to name the candidate he voted for, Chwaszczewski did say that “being out here in more of a rural area, I’m sure there [are] plenty of Trump supporters. I just wanted to kind of not support that.” He feels like something of an outlier in his community. “It’s Trump signs everywhere,” he said, as darkness set in. Democratic Senator Chris Coons defeated Republican Lauren Witzke in Delaware’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin defeated Republican Mark Curran in Illinois’ Senate race. Democratic Senator Ed Markey defeated Republican Kevin O’Connor in Massachusetts’ Senate race. Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen defeated Republican Corky Messner in New Hampshire’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Cory Booker defeated Republican Rik Mehta in New Jersey’s Senate race. Democratic Senator Jack Reed defeats Republican Allen Waters in Rhode Island’s Senate race. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell has defeated Democrat Amy McGrath in Kentucky’s US Senate race, according to the AP news agency. The AP has called for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 69 electoral votes. The AP calls Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Tennessee for the Republican Party, giving Trump 33 electoral votes. It is 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Washington, DC. The AP calls South Carolina for the Republican Party, giving Trump 9 electoral votes. Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath filed this report from Wilmington, North Carolina 
Polls started to close in North Carolina where voters from both parties expressed optimism all day.
Michael Master said he was hopeful Trump would pull out another victory in the state. “As a person, Trump puts Americans first,” Master said at a polling location in Wilmington. “And he puts especially the average American worker first.” Across the parking lot, Biden supporter Nick Rhodes said he was confident Biden would win. “We need to bring our country back together in terms of getting rid of division, and start embracing science and start bringing people together because we cannot have another four years of this,” he said. A handful of precincts in the state will stay open later because of delayed openings. We are expecting to see results from early and absentee voting to start rolling in within the next hour. In-person results will follow later this evening. The Trump campaign and Nevada Republicans are asking a state court judge to extend voting by one hour at 22 Las Vegas-area polling locations, according to the Associated Press news agency and Nevada Independent newspaper An Election Day lawsuit filed in Clark County claims the 22 voting locations did not open on time. It was getting an immediate hearing before Judge Joe Hardy. “If immediate action is not taken, appellants will never have the opportunity to vindicate their rights,” attorneys for the two groups wrote in the filing. “More troubling, Nevadans – and the rest of the country – will be left wondering whether the results of the election are legitimate.” Election officials keep sites open until the last person in line at closing time can vote. Polling places in Nevada are scheduled to close at 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT). All polls will close in the battleground state of Florida at 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT) Here is why the state is so significant.   The AP news agency calls Virginia for the Democratic Party, giving Biden 13 electoral votes. A helpful road map, if you want to figure out how election night is going to shape up, is to keep an eye on seven states’ results, which we will dub the “super” seven. If Biden can win early on any of the following states that Trump won in 2016, it could indicate a positive evening for him. If Trump holds them, that will likely delay a projection of an overall winner. Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas are the states that are expected to count votes fairly efficiently and, if there’s a clear winner, are expected to be projected for one of the two candidates. If Biden picks up one, assuming he also wins all of the states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, he will be well on his way to 270 votes, as it will be a state flipped from Republican to Democrat. If he picks up two, that makes things even clearer and puts Biden well down the path to a potential win. Note that other key Trump states – Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania – are not part of that list. Those states are expected to count their votes much more slowly and if Trump holds onto the other seven, will factor into many more hours, if not days, of waiting for a winner to be projected.   Republican Moore has defeated Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin in West Virginia’s US Senate race. The AP calls West Virginia for the Republican Party, giving Trump five electoral votes. It is 19:30 ET (00:30 GMT) and polls have closed in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among key voters in Georgia, according to exit polls from The Associated Press news agency. Suburban voters, who Trump won by five points in 2016, are backing Biden by double digits in this year’s exit polls. Among suburban women, Biden has the support of six in 10 of them. Turnout among Black voters has kept pace with 2016, as they make up approximately three in 10 voters this year. Biden has also kept pace with Hillary Clinton, with nine in 10 Black voters saying they support Biden. If Biden is to flip Georgia to the Democrats for the first time since 1992, he will need robust turnout from Black voters and a strong showing among suburban voters. Georgia’s polls closed at 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT), but The Associated Press news agency has not called the race as of yet. The AP exit poll surveyed more than 106,000 voters over eight days, including Election Day. The margin of error is +/-0.4 percent. Despite the US witnessing a record number of early votes in the presidential election, tens of millions of American voters headed to polling stations across the country on Tuesday. Polls began closing in the United States at 18:00 Eastern Standard Time (23:00 GMT) and closing times vary by state. Find out when the polls close in each state here.  Democratic US Senator Mark Warner defeats Republican Daniel Gade in Virginia’s US Senate race, according to AP. The AP calls Vermont for the Democratic Party, giving Biden three electoral votes. The AP calls Kentucky for the Republican Party, giving Trump eight electoral votes. It is 19:00 ET (00:00 GMT) and the polls have closed in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Virginia and Vermont. Swing states, also known as battleground states, will have an outsize influencing in deciding the next president of the US. Watch our one-minute explainer on why. Racial justice is one of several big issues on the minds of US voters today, as the country for months has seen mass protests demanding an end to systemic racism and police violence against Black people. Janelle King, a Republican strategist, defended US President Donald Trump, saying he has helped the Black community by tackling unemployment and funding various programmes, such as historically Black colleges and universities. “He provided the Black community with policies,” she told Al Jazeera. But Derrick Plummer, a Democratic strategist, said it is false to say that Trump has done a lot to help the Black community. “When you had peaceful African Americans, Black people, in the streets saying that we want to end systemic racism, we have a president that doesn’t even think systemic racism is real,” he told Al Jazeera. Voters are quite unhappy with the direction of the country and how the federal government is working, according to The Associated Press news agency’s VoteCast data. About three-quarters of voters said they are dissatisfied or angry with the way the government is working and six in 10 say they are unhappy with the direction of the country. Trump has tweeted “we’re looking really good all over the country”. “Thank you,” the president tweeted shortly after the first polling places, in parts of Indiana and Kentucky, closed on Election Day. Indications on who is ahead in preliminary state results are expected to take hours. WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2020  The first polls have closed on Election Day in Indiana and Kentucky. Polls closed in parts of the two states that lie within the Eastern Time zone, but those within the Central Time zone will remain open for an additional hour. Both states are considered Republican bastions, but results are not expected to begin coming in until later Tuesday.   With only a few hours before polls close in Michigan on Election Day, Rashida Tlaib said she is optimistic she will be heading back to Washington, DC. An outspoken progressive, the Palestinian American legislator is up for re-election in the 13th District of Michigan – a Democratic stronghold that she is almost certain to carry. She says strong voter turnout so far in the US elections is very encouraging. “I’ve not, in all the years I’ve run for office, seen lines like this,” Tlaib told Al Jazeera, crediting the crowds in part to a desire to vote President Donald Trump out of office. “[It] gives me hope that the turnout is going to be high enough where it’s very clear that Donald Trump is not wanted as the president of the United States any more.” Read more here. The FBI and the New York attorney general were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home on Election Day as the nation remains on high alert to ensure voting is not compromised, according to the Reuters news agency. US state and local officials have been raising the alarm over at least two separate automated call campaigns as millions of Americans cast their votes on Tuesday to decide between Trump and Biden. Experts who spoke to Reuters say they are mystified by the most prominent robocalling campaign, which has been running for months and tells people to remain home but does not explicitly mention voting. “There’s a little bit of confusion about this one across the industry,” said Giulia Porter, vice president at RoboKiller, a company that fights telemarketers and robocalls and has been tracking the campaign. Audio of the calls, which RoboKiller shared with Reuters, features a synthetic female voice saying: “Hello. This is just a test call. Time to stay home. Stay safe and stay home.” Porter said the call had been placed millions of times in the past 11 months or so but had on Tuesday shot up to number 5 or number 6 in the list of top spam calls. A Department of Homeland Security official said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was investigating the calls. The FBI said only that it was aware of reports of robocalls and had no further comment. Biden made a couple of last-minute campaign visits to Pennsylvania, stopping by his childhood home in Scranton and speaking to volunteers in Philadelphia. Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, he expects to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the three Midwest states known as the “Blue Wall”. “I think we are going to do well. We’re going to re-establish that Blue Wall,” Biden said, referring to Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Trump won those states in 2016, turning them Republican for the first time in decades. Biden said this year is interesting. “You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states are up for grabs. The idea that I’m still in play in Texas, in Georgia, in Florida,” he said. And said he would wait for a result before speaking later on election night. “There’s so much in play out there and an overwhelming vote out there. If there’s something to say tonight, I’ll come out and say it, otherwise, I will wait until all the votes are counted.” Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside a Delaware community centre, Biden said he’s “superstitious” about offering predictions for election night but remains “hopeful”. He added he has heard from aides that there is “overwhelming turnout” among young people, women and older Black adults in places like Georgia and Florida. “The things that are happening bode well for the base that has been supporting me – but we’ll see,” he said. “It’s just so uncertain” because of how many states are in play.   Al Jazeera’s Chris Moody has sent this report from Safety Harbor, Florida Desirae Braverman, a 20-year-old who was eager to vote in her first presidential election this year, showed up in person in the final hours on Election Day after her father accidentally threw away the mail-in ballot she ordered. “He doesn’t pay attention sometimes,” she said of her dad after voting in person in the town library. “I was like, I have no choice but to come down here now last minute. I wanted to do my little part, even if it doesn’t mean that much. I wanted to get out there and say, ‘My vote counts’.” To both presidential campaigns this election cycle, Braverman’s vote actually matters quite a lot: Her small bayside town, Safety Harbor, is located in Pinellas County, one of the most important swing counties in Florida, which is in one of the nation’s most critical battleground states. Pinellas voted for George W Bush in 2004, then supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, only to swing back into Republican hands and vote for Donald Trump in 2016. And this year, it is once again up for grabs in a state likely to face a close outcome. The county is narrowly split between registered Republicans and Democrats, making turnout numbers essential in a tightly contested place like this. Biden’s campaign sent the Democratic nominee’s wife, Jill Biden, to make a last-minute stop on the morning of Election Day to encourage voters.Braverman, a college student who said she cares about social issues such as preserving rights to same-sex marriage and abortion, cast her vote for Biden.”It kind of felt a little liberating because it was my first time,” she said. “It felt good. And I got my little sticker.”  Coronavirus and the economy are the top issues among US voters, according to the Associated Press’ VoteCast data. And voters don’t have positive feelings about how both are being dealt with. About 4 in 10 voters named the pandemic as the top issue facing the US, while 3 in 10 said the economy and jobs were most important. About half of US voters said coronavirus is not at all under control. On the economy, 6 in 10 said the economy is in poor shape. On the issue of law enforcement, of which Donald Trump has made the former a important campaign theme, only 4 percent said that was the country’s top issue.  Al Jazeera’s Patrick Strickland filed this report from Phoenix, Arizona
A slow but steady stream of voters arrived at the Epworth United Methodist Church in Phoenix, Arizona’s capital. Poll volunteers informed new arrivals where to go to cast their ballots, while another group handed out free meals to voters as they left. Feed the Polls is a volunteer initiative that brings together organisations and eateries to keep voters fed while they are waiting at the polls.
“Today we are set to give out 2,000 meals,” said Maria Parra Cano of Sana Sana Foods, one of the groups that teamed up with Feed the Polls. “It’s been a constant flow [of voters] all morning until now,” she told Al Jazeera. “We are really just aiming to try to solve food insecurity on this day.” Justin, 19, said he cast his first-ever vote for President Donald Trump, the Republican incumbent. “The most important thing for me is obviously the economy – we need a strong economy,” said Justin, who declined to provide his surname. “And then law and order is a big thing for me.” Justin also lauded Trump’s foreign policy, citing the recent normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. “It’s a crazy world we live in right now and this election is a big election, just like any election,” Justin added. His friend Robert, a 26-year-old old business student, said the most important issue for him is taxation. On Tuesday he voted for Trump, just like in 2016. “The civil unrest and everything – I feel like there needs to be something done,” said Robert, who also declined to provide his last name.
“And then I think Trump is going to be the one to stop the lockdown,” he added, referring to restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic. “I think it’s time everybody goes back to work.” Al Jazeera’s Hilary Beaumont has sent this update from South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania DJs Ronald Coleman, 33, and Jarkeer Lassiter, 29, danced to Come Closer by Whiz Kid ft. Drake outside a South Philadelphia polling station. They already voted for Biden with mail ballots and now their goal is to get out the vote for Biden by DJing at the polls. They are part of an effort across Philadelphia bringing DJs and free food to voters. Philadelphia voter turnout is high this election, but it is still unclear if it will be high enough to help the Democrat win Pennsylvania. Asked why he voted for Biden, Coleman said, “My mom.” He wants Biden to follow through on his promise to improve healthcare. “Medicare, all the stuff for the older people,” Coleman added. He said people in Philadelphia have been rioting for their rights after the police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr, who was Lassiter’s cousin. “It just hit too close to home for me,” Coleman said. “I just hope it gets better.” Coleman and Lassiter said a lot of first-time voters were making their voices heard in Philadelphia this election. Lassiter said he voted for Biden because Trump failed to contain the pandemic and had stoked racial tension. “It’s like, if he’s in the White House, it’s OK to be [openly racist].” Electing Biden will send a message, he said. “If we get Biden in there, we have to do better.” 3 Nov 2020 - 22:08 GMT Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this report from Kenosha, Wisconsin The Kenosha Unified School District is a sprawling, yet nondescript building on the city’s 52nd Street thoroughfare. On Election Day, its parking lot is brimming with cars including one with a man playing guitar and singing from the bed of a pick-up truck. The glass doors of the building’s entrance are flanked by two pairs of volunteers wearing yellow crew-neck sweatshirts that read “Election Defender”. “It’s a nonpartisan group that is organising … to make sure that voters are taken care of, especially in places where there are long lines,” explained Rena Singer. “It felt good to have something to do today,” she said of the group’s efforts to hand out snacks, personal protective equipment and anything else voters need to make it through the process. Inside, the sterile and fluorescent-lit hallways and rooms are dedicated to same-day voter registration and in-person voting. “Everybody has been in such a good mood, even the voters,” said the location’s chief inspector, Shawnna Smith. “I’m pretty proud of how well curbside voting is going – we don’t usually have that,” she said of the pandemic-inspired practice. Volunteers in yellow vests gather voters’ information, grab a ballot from inside that the voters complete from outside before the voters return them indoors to be counted. “People are taking advantage of it. Instead of risking coming in here, they’re just doing it curbside. It’s safe for them and everybody else,” Smith said. 3 Nov 2020 - 21:31 GMT Wall Street’s main stock indexes rallied as investors hope a clear winner will emerge from an exceptionally divisive US presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up more than 554 points or just more than 2 percent at 27,480.03 – it had been up more than 700 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 – a gauge for the health of US retirement and college savings accounts – closed up 1.78 percent while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished the session up 1.85 percent. Tuesday’s strong finishes extended Monday’s gains. Though storefronts across the country have been boarded up in case violence erupts once the polls close, Wall Street is optimistic that a clear winner will be determined.

Speaking to only a few dozen supporters, mostly volunteers who have backed her husband’s campaign, she emphasised unity before the polls close later tonight. “There is nothing – nothing – we can’t do when we come together with courage and grit,” she told the crowd, who wore masks and stood several feet apart from each other. “Donald Trump is in this for himself. Nothing more, nothing less. And he wants us to believe that we’re all the same, that we’re unhopeful and angry and selfish and divided. But today, we are going to show him who we are.” The appearance outside “Casa Biden”, an independent volunteer office where people have spent months drumming up support for Biden in an area with large Cuban and Puerto Rican populations, was scheduled at the 11th hour to try to increase voter turnout. “This is where the highest concentration of Hispanic voters are,” said Elio Muller, who directs the volunteer operations. “Our precincts are usually 60 percent turnout Democrat.” Al Jazeera’s Jennifer Glasse reflects on casting a ballot in the US after decades abroad. Read more here. 3 Nov 2020 - 19:02 GMT Al Jazeera’s Laurin-Whitney Gottbrath has sent this update from Wilmington, North Carolina. Ricardo Thomas woke up this morning feeling energised. The 35-year-old Wilmington, North Carolina-native was anxious to get to the polls to cast his first-ever ballot. “It was like the first day of school,” he told Al Jazeera. Upon leaving the polling station, Thomas said he was “feeling good”. Thomas explained that while he did not really have an interest in voting before this election, but when COVID-19 hit him and his community especially hard, he started to learn more about the candidates. “I live below the line anyway, so [often election outcomes] would never affect us,” he told Al Jazeera. “Because we don’t know what it is to have the amount of money that the people around us that we provide our services for have,” he said. “When the COVID came, I lost my job, and it really set me back, back, back.” And that’s when he says he knew he had to vote, and “be a part of change and history”. 3 Nov 2020 - 18:43 GMT Al Jazeera’s Cinnamon Janzer has sent this dispatch from Kenosha, Wisconsin Election Day is off to the races in Wisconsin. Erin Decker, chair of the Republican Party of Kenosha County, said she expects “record-high turnout” today, while Lori Hawkins, chair of the Kenosha County Democrats, said she told her children that they are witnessing history. Inside Kenosha’s municipal building, hallways dedicated to central count efforts – to tally absentee ballots separately from the polls – are bustling with volunteers and city officials. Dressed in neon green shirts, dozens of poll workers are steadily counting the 57,650 ballots that have been returned so far at tables of two, spaced six feet apart. A handful of retired men wearing bright orange lanyards attached to white placards reading “election observer” around their necks are mingling among the first-floor crowd. Outside the building, resident Dennis Phillips said he had not voted yet, but that he would likely cast a ballot later for Trump – just as he did in 2016. “He’s been doing pretty good I guess,” Phillips said.

,,The 2020 Election by the Numbers,"                  It’s almost over. Yesterday Electoral College electors convened virtually or in person in state capitals across the country to cast their votes. The result was what everyone expected, the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States. With the election now essentially settled—Republican lawmakers may make one last doomed attempt to reverse the results when Congress meets on January 6 to confirm the Electoral College vote—here’s one last review of how the vote went. The Electoral College More on: Elections and Voting United States 2020 in Review Transition 2021 Joe Biden In 2016, seven electors declined to vote for the candidate they were pledged to. That was the highest number of “faithless electors” ever, with the exception of the election of 1872. That year sixty-three electors broke their pledge. They had a good reason to do so, however. They were pledged to Democratic candidate Horace Greeley—he of “Go West” fame. Greeley died three weeks after losing to Ulysses S. Grant and before the Electoral College met. His pledged electors were understandably reluctant to vote for a dead man. Three electors, however, did cast their votes for Greeley.  This year there were no faithless electors. So the final tally in the Electoral College was 306 to 232. That, of course, is the reverse of the margin Donald Trump won by in 2016. He called that a “massive landslide victory.” Biden flipped five states on his way to winning the Electoral College: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Every other state held to form. The Popular Vote Biden won 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the votes cast. He is the first U.S. presidential candidate to have won more than 80 million votes. Trump won 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. That’s more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won, with the exception of Biden. (Third-party candidates picked up 1.8 percent of the votes cast.) More than 159 million Americans voted in 2020: 159,633,396 to be exact. That’s the largest total voter turnout in U.S. history and the first time more than 140 million people voted. Voter turnout in 2020 was the highest in 120 years when measured as a percentage of the voting-eligible population: 66.7 percent. You have to go back all the way to 1900 to find a higher percentage turnout (73.7 percent). The election of 1876 holds the record for highest turnout: 82.6 percent. That, of course, was also one of America’s most controversial and consequential elections—and not in a good way.         Minnesota holds pride of place with the highest state voter turnout. Eighty percent of Minnesotans went to the polls. Oklahoma holds the dubious distinction of being the state with the lowest voter turnout. Just 55 percent of Oklahomans voted. A Close Election or Not?   So did Biden win comfortably? Yes, if you go by the popular vote. In the past six presidential elections, only Barack Obama in 2008 won by a larger total vote margin than the 7,060,140-vote margin that Biden piled up. Likewise, Biden’s 4.5 percentage point lead is the largest win in the past six elections other than Obama’s seven-point win in 2008. But as Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden, Grover Cleveland, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton can all attest, winning the popular vote doesn’t necessarily mean winning the presidency. When you look at the smallest popular vote shift needed to give Trump a victory, the 2020 election was close. Indeed, it was even closer than 2016. If Trump picked up the right mix of 42,921 votes in Arizona (10,457), Georgia (11,779), and Wisconsin (20,682), the Electoral College would have been tied at 269 all. The House would have then decided the election. Republicans will hold the majority of state delegations in the new Congress, and they undoubtedly would have chosen Trump. If Trump had also picked up the one electoral vote in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, which he lost to Biden by 22,091 votes, he would have won the Electoral College outright. Back in 2016, Clinton needed to pick up the right mix of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College. Women in Congress The 117th Congress will have a record total 141 women, or 26.4 percent of its membership, when it convenes on January 3. (Even so, women’s representation in Congress will lag behind that in the national legislatures of many other democratic countries.) Those numbers don’t include Senator Kamala Harris, who will be resigning her seat, or non-voting delegates in the House. These numbers could change slightly or remain the same, depending on whether Kelly Loeffler wins the January 5 run-off for her Georgia Senate seat and who is appointed to fill Vice-President-Elect Harris’s Senate seat. Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge is set to resign her seat so she can become secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Women won’t, however, be equally distributed between the two parties. Democrats will have 105 women members of Congress, which is one less than in the 116th Congress. Republicans will have thirty-six women lawmakers, or fourteen more than in the 116th Congress. That breaks the record the GOP set back in 2006. The House will have 117 women lawmakers, with eighty-nine Democrats and twenty-eight Republicans. Nine out of the thirteen House seats Republicans flipped from blue to red were won by women. Meanwhile, there will be twenty-four women senators, sixteen of whom are Democrats and eight of whom are Republicans. Again, how Loeffler fares on January 5 and who replaces Harris and Fudge could change these numbers. A record fifty-one women of color will serve in the 117th Congress. The previous record was forty-eight, set by the 116th Congress. Republicans broke their record for most women of color in Congress (five). The previous GOP record was three, set in 2014. Forty-six women of color will represent Democrats (not including Kamala Harris), down from the record forty-seven from the last Congress. Cori Bush (D-MO) became the first Black congresswoman elected in Missouri and Marilyn Strickland (D-WA) the first in the state of Washington. Strickland also joins Young Kim (R-CA) and Michelle Steel (R-CA) to become the first Korean American women in Congress. Wyoming elected its first female Senator: Republican Cynthia Lummis.   Other Notable Developments People of color will make up about 28 percent of the new House. Elected to the House this year, not including non-voting delegates, are forty-three Hispanic Americans (three more than the 116th Congress); sixteen Asian Americans (three more than the 116th); fifty-seven Black Americans (five more than the 116th); and five American Indians (two more than the 116th), and one native Hawaiian, Kaiali’i Kahele. Kahele is only the second native Hawaiian elected since Hawaii became a state in 1959. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) is the only Hispanic member of the Senate’s incoming freshman class. Once he is sworn in, the Senate will have five Latinx members, with the others being Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. The Senate will have two Black members after Harris resigns, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina. That number could go higher depending on whether Raphael Warnock wins his race in Georgia and on who is chosen to succeed Harris as California’s junior senator. The Senate will continue to have two senators of Asian descent, Democrats Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY) became the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress. The addition of Jones and Torres means that a record number of eleven LGBTQ+ lawmakers will be in the 117th Congress.   Morgan Cawthorn (R-NC) became the youngest person elected to the House in modern history. He is twenty-five years old. The pandemic helped popularize early voting and mail-in ballots. Americans cast 101,453,111 early votes. That is 64.1 percent of the total votes cast in 2020. The total number of mail-in ballots was 65,642,049. Looking Ahead The 2022 congressional midterm elections will be held on November 8, 2022. That is 693 days away. All 435 House seats and thirty-four Senate seats will be up for grabs. The 2024 election will be held on November 5, 2024. That’s 1,421 days away. Margaret Gach assisted in the preparation of this post.    ",www.cfr.org,https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers,,

,,Biden Is Running For Reelection. What Are His Chances For 2024?,"2024 ELECTION APR. 25, 2023, AT 7:37 AM PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER / GETTY IMAGES After months of prognosticating and tons of built-up anticipation, the day is finally upon us: President Biden has announced that he’s seeking a second term in 2024. The announcement comes after months of teasing from the Biden administration — first it was supposed to happen somewhere around Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Then “not long after” February’s State of the Union. Then in the beginning of April. But in the end, today’s announcement was mostly unsurprising because most presidents seek reelection, and they often win when they go for it. That said, in polls fielded throughout Biden’s first few years in office, many Democratic voters said they’re ready to move on from him, a sentiment almost certainly spurred by concerns about Biden’s age (he’s 80 now, and he’d be almost 82 on Election Day) and his low approval ratings. The problem, of course, is that an obvious alternative to Biden hasn’t surfaced. And in some ways, it will be easy for him to make the case that he’s been a successful president who deserves another four years in office. But the worries that made his own base ambivalent about a second Biden term are likely to haunt his candidacy, too.   So let’s walk through Biden’s first two(ish) years in the White House — the good, the bad and the ugly — and take a look at his odds in both the primary and the general election.  Perhaps no measure better captures the good, the bad and the ugly of Biden’s presidency than his approval rating. Americans were relatively high on Biden when he was elected, but that didn’t last long. He came into office with a 53 percent approval rating and 36 percent disapproval rating, according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, and it wasn’t hard to understand why: Americans were largely unhappy with former President Donald Trump. Just a few months after his inauguration, Biden signed into law the widely popular American Rescue Plan, a sweeping aid package that included help to states to help combat the coronavirus pandemic and $1,400 direct payments to certain Americans. But goodwill is fragile in an increasingly polarized political environment, and Americans started to sour on Biden after only a few months. Starting in August 2021, his approval rating dropped precipitously and his disapproval rating rose sharply. It was a kind of presidential perfect storm: the delta variant of the coronavirus was surging, the economic fallout from the pandemic was starting to come into focus and the administration’s bungled response to withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan was making headlines. Later that winter, it also became more clear that major parts of Biden’s election platform — like passing bills to protect voting rights and to reform policing — were doomed, and Biden’s omnibus Build Back Better Act suffered a setback after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin refused to back an early version with a multi-trillion dollar price tag, citing concerns about how it would affect inflation.  As the chart above shows,1
Biden never quite recovered. In fact, since that first summer of his presidency, Biden’s approval has consistently remained underwater. But there’s not necessarily one policy failure that explains this trend, William Howell, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told me. In fact, one feature of American politics is that presidential approval ratings almost always drop over time. “I think that we tend to over-interpret the significance of individual events or perceived gaffes,” Howell said. “But when the euphoria of a campaign or the fresh gloss of a new candidate wears off and you get into the drudgery of actually governing, approval ratings routinely decline. And that’s what we’ve seen here.”  One challenge for Biden is that his presidency has arguably been quite successful — his wins just haven’t been enough to save his approval rating. Despite only barely having majority support in the U.S. Senate for all of his time in office so far, the post-honeymoon phase of Biden’s presidency was surprisingly productive: He was able to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a bipartisan infrastructure bill and another bipartisan gun-safety bill. In addition, almost half of Americans gave the Biden administration decently high marks for its initial handling of Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. The president also received praise after he announced a popular plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt (though that’s currently tangled up with the Supreme Court).  But none of those victories really helped Biden in the court of public opinion. Even Democrats’ strong performance in last year’s midterm races failed to move the needle for him, and now that Republicans control the U.S. House, it’s unlikely that Biden will be able to usher through meaty legislative priorities. Compared to past presidents, though, Biden actually starts his reelection bid as somewhat of an underdog. In fact, as of April 24, only 42.5 percent of Americans approved of his job as president. That’s actually not far off from Trump (41.3 percent) and former President Barack Obama’s (45.1 percent) approval numbers on April 24 the year before they sought reelection. But, perhaps worryingly for Biden, he’s still on lower end compared to recent presidents. The approval ratings of recent presidents who sought reelection on April 24 the year before an election and on Election Day Gerald Ford is not included because there is no available public polling on his job approval from July through November 1976. SOURCE: POLLS Of course, having an underwater approval rating doesn’t mean Biden’s reelection campaign is doomed. Given the polarized nature of our current politics, all future presidents — not just Biden — will likely suffer lower approval ratings “absent a really good economy,” said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Without that, Bowman told me, “it’s hard to foresee a president moving their ratings up significantly.” What’s working against Biden, though, is that the economy has never been an area of immense strength for him: According to an the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey from mid-March, just 31 percent of adults overall said that they approve of Biden’s stewardship of the national economy, which is consistent with past surveys. Yet even with lackluster marks on the economy, there was no reason to expect Biden would throw in the towel after just one term. As I mentioned before, both Biden — and his wife, Jill — have long teased today’s announcement (which probably helped keep any notable primary challengers at bay — sorry Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson)! But even though Biden may be Democrats’ most viable option at this point, that doesn’t mean his party’s voters are over the moon about today’s announcement.  That ennui might be unavoidable for Biden, because a number of polls and reports suggest that Democrats’ biggest issue with Biden isn’t his performance in office — it’s his age. Biden was the oldest living president the day he was sworn into office, and according to a USA Today/Suffolk Poll from mid-April, a plurality of 2020 Biden voters (42 percent) said that his age makes them less likely to support him. What might work in Biden’s favor, though, at least in a primary, is that 55 percent of his voters said his age didn’t make a difference to them. Meanwhile, a second survey from CNN/SSRS conducted in March found that two-thirds of adults felt as though Biden doesn’t have the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively. And there are also real concerns that he’s not a particularly motivating figure, even if Democrats probably prefer him to a Republican alternative. That CNN/SSRS survey found that a majority of respondents thought that Biden does not inspire confidence (65 percent) and does not care about people like them (54 percent). These numbers, of course, could present an opening for someone on Biden’s left flank to announce a challenge to his candidacy, but surveys show that some of the potential Democratic candidates polling best against Biden currently are in his administration: Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. So barring a major collapse in Biden’s standing, a serious primary challenger at this point appears very unlikely. Plus, in a February Yahoo News/YouGov survey, almost half (47 percent) of registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning independent voters said they’d renominate Biden for president versus “someone else” (34 percent). And, fact is, elected presidents rarely face serious opposition for renomination. More importantly, Biden has a solid standing on a number of policy issues — at least among his base. That USA Today survey found that 70 percent of Biden voters (including 73 percent of self-identified liberals, 78 percent of moderates and 65 percent of conservatives) are largely in favor of the president’s positions and policies. Moreover, a second poll from The Economist/YouGov fielded in late March found Democratic adults overwhelmingly approved of Biden’s handling of the economy (72 percent), foreign policy (72 percent), immigration (64 percent), crime (60 percent) and inflation (59 percent). So while voters may not be jumping for joy about  another four years under Biden, the poll seems to suggest that most also don’t mind how he’s currently governing.  “Elections operate like Wall Street: fear and greed. And while Biden’s age may tamper the greed, the prospects of a Donald Trump winning the presidency again is enough to raise the fear levels,” said Allan Lichtman, the author of “Predicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House,” which is now in seven editions, and a history professor at American University. “There’s no way Democrats are not going to coalesce around Joe Biden, even if Ron DeSantis is the nominee.” All that’s to say that despite their misgivings about his age, Democrats will still likely vote for Biden in a primary. But what about his odds in a general election? Voters currently say that they don’t want a redux of the 2020 election — but they might get one anyway. Biden and Trump, who is currently leading the Republican primary field, are currently favored to win their respective party’s nominations. And according to Lichtman, Biden’s run for a second term already gives Democrats an edge in 2024 since they avoid both an internal party battle and have the power of incumbency on their side.  But that doesn’t mean Biden will skate into a second term unscathed — far from it. In fact, there’s plenty of reason to believe that Biden’s age could be a liability in a general election, especially if he faces someone like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (currently polling second after Trump in FiveThirtyEight’s 2024 Republican primary polling average) who, at 44, is just over half Biden’s age, making for an easy generational contrast. And the imperfect, hypothetical head-to-head polling we have for the 2024 general election suggest that Biden would face an uphill climb against both Trump and DeSantis. A Wall Street Journal poll fielded in mid-to-late April, for instance, found Biden (45 percent) trailing DeSantis (48 percent) among registered voters in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, while the president narrowly led Trump by just 3 percentage points. (Both leads, however, were within the poll’s margin of error). This lines up with past polling, which also suggested that Biden would be essentially tied with both men. Howell pointed out there are a number of reasons that we could be heading for a tight race in 2024. “So there’s the issue of his age, but the big question will be what the state of the economy and the inflation rate is,” he said. “And if that war in Ukraine is still dragging on come the election, we can expect Biden’s Republican opponent to raise all kinds of questions about why we were dragged into this and where it’s going. I think those are the big things to watch out for.” But, again, early head-to-head polling here is imperfect and certainly subject to change, especially as the GOP primary field settles — after all, DeSantis isn’t even formally in the game. Regardless of what the surveys say, though, we live in a very evenly divided country and every presidential election these days is close, so we — and Biden — should be prepared for a very competitive race.

,,Can Joe Biden Intervene in a House Speaker Vote As President?,"As the chaos that has embroiled the House Republican Caucus entered its third day Thursday, President Joe Biden's White House has already made one thing clear: that the disfunction in the House was Republicans' mess to clean up, and theirs alone. ""We're certainly not going to insert ourselves in what's happening on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this week. ""He was a senator, he understands how this process works, and he's just not going to insert himself, he's going to let the process play out and continue to do the work of the American people,"" she added. Procedurally, there's nothing Biden can do, per the House rules. That framework dictates that the process of deciding who leads their conference is solely up to its members, who have so far failed to give any single candidate the plurality they need to become Speaker of the House in almost one-dozen consecutive votes. Entering the fourth day of votes for Speaker of the House Friday, some wondered if there was an imperative for him to act. The House of Representatives cannot consider or pass legislation until a speaker is seated, and, currently, there appears to be little indication the far-right House Freedom Caucus—which has so far refused to support leading Republican Kevin McCarthy's bid for the post—plans to yield any time soon. Truthfully, there's little incentive for Biden to do anything: the Republican Party comes into the 118th Congress with a majority, which top Republican Kevin McCarthy has pledged to wield to obstruct numerous facets of the Biden administration's agenda. He has also pledged to lead myriad investigations into a number of cabinet-level officials like FBI director Christopher Wray and Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, whom Republicans have targeted as the central figure in the Biden administration's perceived failures at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even conservatives admit that there is really no rush to seat a speaker of the house anytime soon. ""The stakes for the Speakership of the House are incredibly low at this point because all the leader of the House, basically, has to do is say 'no' to most of Joe Biden's proposals,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said on his daily podcast earlier this week. After calling House Speaker's race ""funny,"" Ben Shapiro: ""The stakes for the Speakership of the House are incredibly low at this point because all the leader of the House, basically, has to do is say 'no' to most of Joe Biden's proposals"" pic.twitter.com/bpKNdfmkj4 In short: if Republicans are trying to build a coalition against the Biden administration, they're going to have to do it alone—despite Biden's longstanding reputation as a dealmaker willing to work across the aisle. ""With regards to the fight over the Speaker...that's not my problem,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House for an appearance in Kentucky Wednesday afternoon. ""I just think it's a little embarrassing that it's taking so long,"" he added. Presidents in recent history rarely involved themselves in the process. Barack Obama—who had a reportedly rocky relationship with former Republican speaker Paul Ryan—remained on the sidelines of his contentious 2015 bid for the post amid the party's then-Republican majority. Looking back, however, there was at least one episode in early U.S. history where a president got intimately involved with the process. In 1834, then-president Andrew Jackson—a former Speaker of the House himself—sought to lobby friendly members of Congress to appoint future president James K. Polk for the post. However, when members of his ""Kitchen Cabinet""—a group of unofficial advisers he'd appointed in a break with his then-Vice President—went to Capitol Hill to lobby on Polk's behalf, many members of Congress, including some in Jackson's own party, perceived the effort as an encroachment upon the constitutional prerogative of the House, leading to a splintering of his party.

,,The Alarming Calm of the Biden Campaign," One Friday morning in November, a handful of Joe Biden’s top aides gathered in a Sheraton conference room in Chicago. Alumni of Barack Obama’s first presidential bid had descended on the city to celebrate the 15th anniversary of his 2008 victory, and now, after a night of partying, more than 100 of them had rolled out of bed to hear the Biden campaign’s leaders detail the effort to get the president a second term. The audience had reason to be skeptical about 2024, even panicky. The president is old, hobbled by the aftereffects of a big spike in inflation, buffeted by two wars, and starting to trail in polls against an opponent whose grip on the Republican Party seems stronger than ever. An off-cycle Election Day was looming after the weekend. At the Sheraton, the Biden team unveiled a version of the presentation it had been giving to nervous Democrats around the country. Campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez described how Biden’s accomplishments, like drug-pricing reform, poll well — at least once voters are reminded of the details. Becca Siegel, a senior adviser, spoke about how Biden has a few promising paths to 270 votes in the Electoral College. The Obama veterans (many of whom also worked for the 2012 campaign and know a bit about reelecting unpopular incumbents) were looking for reassurance. Some were sated, but others were itching for more substance. They pressed the Biden aides for details. How might third-party candidates affect youth turnout? What’s your precise understanding of how to reach voters with inscrutable media-consumption habits? Toward the end of the session, Siegel told the room that the election was going to be close no matter what they did. The Sheraton fell silent as she reminded the group that in November 2020, only 45,000 votes in a few states had kept Donald Trump from a second term. It was, in the words of one Democrat present, an “Oh God moment.” These operatives hadn’t expected to learn about some silver-bullet master plan to vanquish Trump once and for all. Still, more than one told me they couldn’t shake the feeling that for a sophisticated crowd, what they were hearing — the high-level outline of the Biden plan — felt obvious. Another thought the Bidenites were starting to come across as “absurdly defensive.” One somewhat sideways best-case interpretation came from a former senior Obama strategist: Maybe the Biden aides didn’t feel it was the proper venue for a deeper dive precisely because they were facing so many the-sky-is-falling questions — a rationale of “I don’t need to be with all these fucking smart-asses telling me I’m doing everything wrong.” Whatever the reason, even Obama alums who thought the briefing went well felt they still had little grasp on the exact plan to address Biden’s two biggest problems: his age — he’s 81 — and higher prices. Then, a few days later, Democrats continued their eye-popping run of electoral overperformance. They won in Kentucky, Ohio, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, fueled by voter fury with a radicalizing GOP and the Supreme Court decision that nullified the constitutional right to abortion. If Biden was dragging his party down, there was no evidence for it at the ballot box. With less than a year until the 2024 vote, there is a glaring cognitive split at the top of the Democratic Party. While commentators and many strategists are aghast at Biden’s polling slide and desperate to see a course correction, the president’s aides at the White House and at reelection headquarters give every indication that they consider the election very much under control. The morning after the November 7 vote, Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, circulated a toldja-so memo scoffing at the “pundit class” practice of “breathlessly making prediction after prediction about November 2024 based on polling” and pointing out that Biden “now presides over the best midterm & off-year combo for a president’s party in 20 years.” Another Biden insider described the run of off-year election victories to me as “canaries in the coal mine, dying,” and predicted that the president would win next November because “Dobbs is going to be on every ballot in every jurisdiction in America.” Democrats have been doing better than expected in all sorts of elections since Roe was overruled, and abortion-rights activists are pushing ballot initiatives in at least ten states. To many outside this bubble of confidence, Biden’s position looks as feeble as ever. His job-approval rating is hovering below 40 percent, lower than any president in recent memory at this point in his first term. Many young voters appear to be revolting against him, reading his administration’s support for Israel as a lack of concern for the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza. There are a slew of encouraging reports about the economy, but voters don’t seem to be giving Biden any credit — instead they’re just pissed off that everything costs a lot more than it used to. The latest Reuters poll has Trump leading Biden by double digits on who better handles the economy. Several chaos agents have emerged who could find their way onto ballots and siphon off support, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West, Jill Stein, and perhaps a centrist or two yet to enter the contest. Biden’s latest primary challenger, the obscure and largely self-funded congressman Dean Phillips, has essentially no shot of winning but is promising to relentlessly target Biden for his age and ability to serve competently. Earlier this month, the president himself inadvertently restarted the debate over his place in the race by telling donors at a fundraiser near Boston that “if Trump wasn’t running, I’m not sure I’d be running.” Attempting to clean up his remarks, he undermined one of his original rationales for his candidacy, telling reporters he was just one of “probably 50” Democrats who could beat Trump. The result of all this is that anyone who is watching closely and wants Biden to win, or simply doesn’t want to see Trump win, feels at least a little scared about 2024. Biden’s campaign is, for now, following a well-organized and well-funded but straightforward playbook against an opponent who is anything but normal — erratic, despised, and under indictment for dozens of alleged crimes. But one way to understand how Biden’s lieutenants can feel calm about his lack of enthusiastic support is that they can still win if Biden simply remains less objectionable than Trump to some plurality of the electorate that gets him to 270 votes. It’s worked before. “God, Biden doesn’t energize me,” one super-wealthy donor said to me recently, sighing. But he was still supporting the president because “then there’s the other side, which is the fascist.” If the campaign has an unofficial motto, it might be “Calm the fuck down, trust the process, and vote for Joe Biden. One. More. Time.” His top advisers believe that the political-media complex is repeating all its mistakes of 2019 in underestimating Biden and misunderstanding just how low Trump has sunk in voters’ estimation. They’re convinced Biden will rebound in popularity as the election gets closer and its stakes become apparent to the average voter. They also fully expect that no matter what happens between now and Election Day, the race will be decided by the narrowest of margins, just like almost every recent contest. Those expectations came through clearly during the Biden staffers’ presentation at the Sheraton in Chicago. The former senior Obama strategist said, “My most negative perception is they suspect, at the end, that ‘these people are going to be with us. These people are going to get onboard. We just have to get to that point, and part of it is Trump emerging.’” This assumption could very well come true, he said. He just wasn’t ready to bet on it. A simple lack of enthusiasm among rank-and-file Democrats could spell doom. Given all that rides on it, the president’s reelection effort is built on a confidence that, even to the party’s elite, can come off as terrifying. One week after Democrats’ near sweep of the November 7 elections, I checked in with Biden’s campaign advisers in Wilmington, Delaware. “It seems like the only thing people want to pay attention to is the polls and not the work,” said Quentin Fulks, Chávez Rodríguez’s principal deputy. “That’s why we keep turning people toward ‘Look how people are turning out to vote.’” Young-voter turnout had surged in Pennsylvania, and large majorities of Latino and Black voters in Ohio had voted to protect abortion rights. Tyler added that the outcomes were “confirmation that we have the right strategy in place. We’re confident that if we keep our heads down, ignore the chatter, ignore the noise, and put our plan in place, we’ll be successful on Election Day.” That plan rests on certain assumptions — a set of fundamental beliefs about Biden, the media, and the coming year. The central article of faith is that Biden’s support will consolidate once Trump wins the GOP primary and voters lock into the rematch. One Biden aide pointed me to a recent poll conducted by a Democratic group showing that despite Trump’s huge primary lead, only a fifth of Americans are convinced that he will be nominated. A second, related tenet is that while the political class has long since dialed into 2024’s apocalyptic stakes, most American minds are simply elsewhere. “The average swing voter thinks about politics four minutes a week,” Jim Messina, Obama’s 2012 campaign manager, told me in September, “and they’re not waking up for another 12 months.” In that time, plenty will change. A common refrain is that at this point in 2019, Trump had not been impeached and no one had ever heard of a disease called COVID. Third, the Biden strategy assumes that his poll numbers will get a cyclical improvement. Just about every other president who has been reelected hit a trough of some sort around this point in their first terms, including Obama and Bill Clinton. A final fundamental is that the public has only begun to glimpse Biden’s reelection effort, and therefore none of its potential has been realized. “It doesn’t matter that people don’t think their lives are better or know what Biden has done now,” said an outside Democratic strategist, someone who thinks the Biden-is-cooked narrative is vastly overstated. “They have a year and a billion dollars in ads to make the case. That’s what a campaign is.” Early this fall, Messina, who talks regularly with members of Biden’s inner circle, distributed a 22-slide deck that he hoped would send a message to concerned Democrats — or, as he termed them to Politico, the “fucking bed-wetters.” He acknowledged that the race would be close but looked to ratchet nerves down by arguing that Biden has at least four credible avenues to victory in the Electoral College. One is simply to replicate the 2020 map for 303 electoral votes. This was not easy to do the first time around and may be harder to pull off again; Biden flipped Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan and became the first Democrat to win Arizona and Georgia in decades. A second path is narrower: Biden could win exactly the necessary 270 by carrying those midwestern “blue wall” states — even if he concedes Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Nevada. A third route is the reverse of the second one, a “Sunbelt strategy” that would net 275. The fourth option calls for replicating 2022’s Senate-race results, dropping Wisconsin and North Carolina but winning the other battlegrounds for 293. The hard part is that no two of these states require the same winning formula, not even the ones that tend to swing together or that look demographically similar from afar. Recent polling suggests, for example, that Biden is running much stronger with Latino voters in Arizona than in Nevada. In 2020, he flipped Georgia largely on the strength of Black voters near Atlanta, white suburbanites who’d soured on Trump, and the young. This election cycle, Biden is losing youth support in Georgia, and his team is keeping watch on both West — who is heavily targeting disillusioned voters, including Black ones — and a third-party effort fueled by the No Labels group. North Carolina is another state with a large population of highly educated former Republicans that No Labels could help put in Trump’s column. Michigan, meanwhile, is the locus of Democratic concern about backlash to the war in Gaza, given the large Arab American population around Detroit. The final margin in any of these states may easily be in the mere thousands, and Biden’s aides haven’t yet decided how to prioritize different sets of voters over the long run. In Wisconsin, for example, they must balance between turning out the base in Dane County, a booming and reliably left-leaning area, and persuading swing voters in the “WOW” counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington. “A year out from Election Day in 2020, did most people think we could win Georgia? I don’t think so,” said Siegel, who ran Biden’s analytics effort last time. “It would be crazy to build some system that does not allow for some level of change.” Rather than make any of those long-term decisions now, the Biden campaign has been rolling out a $25 million ad blitz and constructing a pair of organizing programs in Wisconsin and Arizona with two dozen staffers each. The early stages of this effort have focused on the Democratic base: In Milwaukee, they’re targeting Black voters; in Madison, young voters; and in Phoenix, Latino voters. But the idea is to expand beyond these states to the five other battlegrounds in the New Year, plugging into the political infrastructure built by Democrats who have recently won statewide there. This has some liberals, alarmed by Biden’s unpopularity, nervous that the campaign is moving too slowly. Several vented their worries to Politico recently that state-level hiring is well behind the pace of the Trump 2020 and Obama 2012 campaigns. Biden aides think this criticism entirely misses the point: They’re deliberately avoiding Obama’s pattern, which proved to be expensive. Nevertheless, soon after Politico published the remarks, the campaign publicized its plans for new staff in Nevada, then Wisconsin. (It had just finalized hires in Michigan and was getting close on others in Pennsylvania.) That still wasn’t enough to fend off a new round of plaintive messages from allies begging Wilmington to accelerate hiring, nor did it assuage some swing-state organizers’ concerns that the campaign needs to do heavy lifting, soon, to explain to many voters what exactly Biden has done for them. “It’s a tale as old as time,” one of the organizers said to me. “Not a lot of people know about government programs.” The Biden campaign has begun to use the DNC’s capacity to call and text selected groups across the country, engaging specific cohorts over local issues (like Republican efforts to de-emphasize racism and slavery in Florida schools) to build a base of volunteers and voters. In Wilmington, the belief is that doing this early is necessary because voters’ information-consumption habits have changed so much even since 2020. “Especially when you look at our core coalition of voters — young voters, African American voters, Latino voters — we have to be more surgical in our approach,” said Chávez Rodríguez. Part of addressing this has meant identifying, recruiting, and cultivating community-focused messengers whom the Biden team can rely on to spread tailored messages to a variety of local and demographic groups. It has also been a technical process. The DNC circulates positive clips and images to volunteers who then share these with their personal networks and followings; they input information about reactions into the party’s centralized voter file using an app called Reach. This allows the campaign to learn about its voters and about what kinds of messages and delivery methods are working. That’s also a central goal of the initial advertising effort, which is aimed at a general-election audience and which the campaign is following up with detailed surveys to gauge its effectiveness. The idea is to understand the electorate with new granularity by the time the outreach program broadens: Do 18-to-30-year-old Black voters around Philadelphia pay more attention to 30-second YouTube pre-roll ads or minute-long spots on Eagles broadcasts or door-knocks? Do older Latinos in Mecklenburg County watching the MLS playoffs in Spanish tune out when an ad about abortion comes on at halftime? Are Asian American immigrants in southern Nevada most likely to respond to a physical mail piece featuring Biden’s face or a radio ad full of warnings about Trump? Perhaps one reason the Biden campaign can seem unnervingly confident is that an overall plan, in some form, has been in place for longer than Biden has been president. Many foundational decisions were made late in Biden’s previous campaign by two senior aides: his then–campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon and the communications and political strategist Anita Dunn. By the transition, they’d outlined plans to house Biden’s political muscle and fundraising at the DNC, which could stockpile larger-than-ever sums on his behalf thanks to the Supreme Court’s laissez-faire approach to campaign financing. By last year’s elections, under O’Malley Dillon’s oversight, the DNC set up data, communications, and organizing presences in Washington and the central swing states, which were all home to important midterm races but were also sure to feature prominently in 2024. Late last year, the question of who would be Biden’s campaign manager was a popular topic of gossip in Washington. The position was coveted but tricky. Democratic insiders widely assumed that the bulk of the reelection strategy would effectively be run from the White House, where O’Malley Dillon and Dunn now work, not campaign HQ — even more than usual for incumbent presidents, considering the way Biden relies on an especially tight inner circle. In addition to O’Malley Dillon and Dunn, that includes his fixer, Steve Ricchetti, and his adviser, mind reader, and image-maker, Mike Donilon. In April, the campaign-manager job went to Chávez Rodríguez, who is 45 and grew up in California’s Central Valley in a family of union activists. She spent eight years in the Obama administration before joining Kamala Harris’s Senate office, then her 2020 campaign. When that effort flamed out, Chávez Rodríguez found work as a deputy to O’Malley Dillon and parlayed that into an influential role in Biden’s White House liaising with local and tribal governments. Biden got to know her; he’d put a bust of her grandfather, the legendary labor organizer Cesar Chavez, in the Oval Office when he moved in. She became a dedicated Bidenite and something of a true believer. The first time I met with her in Wilmington this fall, I brought up Biden’s age. Chávez Rodríguez began what seemed like a well-practiced answer, highlighting his experience, character, and work in “so many communities throughout the country.” Then, appearing to surprise herself, she paused. She’d just been reminded, she said, of a recent conversation with a tribal chairman. She looked stricken: “What the chairman said to me is ‘Joe Biden has turned 400 years of hurt into 400 years of hope.’” To my amazement, a trickle of tears fell from her eyes onto the conference-room table. Associates have heard Chávez Rodríguez refer to a small group — including O’Malley Dillon, Dunn, Ricchetti, and Donilon — as the campaign’s “White House board of directors.” The result of the extensive preplanning is that much of the campaign infrastructure was up and running early. When deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty walked into his new job this fall from a role running the White House’s digital strategy, he was greeted by a staff of 55 that had been stationed at the DNC to assemble the building blocks of the campaign’s digital program for three years. “The benefit of time that we have, while the Republicans are sort of chasing their tails and trying to figure out who’s doing what, is the most beneficial part of this campaign,” said Fulks, who ran Senator Raphael Warnock’s reelection campaign against Herschel Walker. “The Joe Biden campaign wins or loses based on what we’re doing now, in this time frame, because we have this large runway to plot out our plan of attack and make sure that the foundational aspects of our organization — our engine — are running.” Much of the public side of this approach has relied on spreading pro-Biden messaging through individual voter testimonials. There’s nothing particularly innovative about the form, but members of campaign leadership say the spots have proved in testing to be among the most effective so far. That includes the clips making Biden’s economic pitch. In the Phoenix media market, one ad features Bill Ruiz, a union carpenter, attributing a glut of jobs to Biden’s legislative agenda: “There’s a manufacturing boom, and it’s thanks to Joe Biden.” In Wisconsin, a cement mason named Kilah tells the camera over upbeat music, “I feel like Joe Biden understands people like me.” A long list of Biden accomplishments rolls by: “Wages are going up around here. The people that I deal with on a day-to-day basis, they’re getting a pay raise.” Biden has taken to the road to make the case for Bidenomics, a conservative pejorative that he co-opted. These trips have a Platonic ideal: In August, one week before the first GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Biden visited a wind-turbine generator plant there to talk up his investments in manufacturing and clean energy. As he visited, the host company said it would hire 100 workers using money it got from his Inflation Reduction Act and would produce electric-vehicle charging stations; Siemens simultaneously said it would start building solar inverters in Kenosha County. The next morning, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel featured a huge picture of Biden on the front page under the word BIDENOMNICS. An adjacent headline informed locals, “Trump, 18 Allies Charged in Georgia.” Despite this push, Biden still polls poorly on economic matters. To some supporters, it’s a sign his appeal is devoid of emotional resonance as he confronts a race unlikely to be fought over spending levels or tax incentives. “The Biden team needs a better word to explain his accomplishments than Bidenomics,” said John Morgan, an Orlando attorney who is a longtime party donor. “Whoever came up with that, they don’t have a place in the advertising world. The average reading level in America is seventh grade, and they’re thinking, What the fuck does that mean? ” It’s similarly unclear that Biden’s repeated trips are breaking through to the broader electorate as much as he would hope, despite the trillions in new spending he’s gotten passed for much-needed infrastructure and energy projects. “The bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill, those are monster game changers,” Phil Murphy, New Jersey’s Democratic governor and a prominent Biden booster, told me. “I’d be out there morning, noon, and night ribbon-cutting with shovels.” There is no alignment over how exactly to address the malaise, not least because of the increasing suspicion that something is simply broken in the way public opinion usually tracks the economy. One NBC poll found that voters were twice as likely to be happy with the state of their own wallet than the overall economy. The prevailing theory is that even with inflation in check — that is, no longer rising sharply — Americans are still bitter that prices feel high when compared to the recent past. “One of my concerns about the Biden team is they seem to be full of these D.C. careerists who view the world in terms of passing legislation,” said a former Democratic governor who has known Biden for years. “For all his strengths, he is a guy who built a career around that. They talk about it like voters watch MSNBC every day.” Inside the Oval Office, Donilon and Biden have for months been discussing a crucial point in how to characterize the economy: Donilon has said Biden should remind voters how much it has improved, and Biden counters that he has to keep acknowledging that many Americans still feel financial pain. One group funded by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a Democratic power donor, recently began urging Biden to talk less about jobs and more about inflation. “Simply put, Biden’s jobs message isn’t getting the job done,” the group concluded in a memo it circulated widely. “The White House needs a clearer focus on prices.” Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, told me about a focus group she ran over the summer. One voter supported Trump in 2016, switched to Biden in 2020, and was now for Trump again. “I’m going to turn off the TV. I’m not going to watch the news, and I’m just going to enjoy Trump’s economy,” he said. Biden cannot afford to let this attitude settle. Late this past summer, not far from the White House, a Biden aide told me, “If we look back on this period with regret, it’s because we didn’t spend this time going after Trump.” Around that time, a pollster in the broader Biden orbit said, “You won’t really see the president’s numbers improve until it’s a clearer contrast.” For much of 2023, people close to Biden theorized that the right time would come sometime in the first quarter of 2024, but the ex-president’s domination of the GOP primary accelerated the timeline. The Saturday after Thanksgiving, Trump opened an old Republican wound by floating another push to get rid of Obamacare. By Thursday, Biden was airing an ad in Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Raleigh featuring a pediatric nurse named Jody talking about health-care costs and Biden’s work lowering them. She warns, direct to the camera, “The idea that we could go back to the policies that help the rich get richer and left so many people behind? I don’t want to go back. Can’t go back.” It was a welcome step for those liberals who think Biden’s staff has tended to be too cautious. “The question with them is always, Do they aim a little low?” said a strategist not affiliated with the campaign. “Where’s the ambition?” I talked to Chávez Rodríguez a few hours after the ad began airing. She told me Trump had been giving her campaign “a perfect opportunity by putting out these extreme policy proposals,” not just on health care — most Republicans had been happy to stop promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a repeated electoral loser — but also on immigration. (We were speaking before the administration considered backing new limits on asylum seekers in exchange for Ukraine war aid.) Fulks, who was also on the line, jumped in. “We’ve got to paint the picture of what’s at stake because that motivates people just as much as what the president has accomplished,” he said. “It’s both/and.” Biden’s campaign has recently turned its attention to Trump more fully, seeking to make sure voters get the most ominous picture of Trump’s second-term agenda by reminding them of his extreme right-wing dreams, like reinstituting and expanding a travel ban on Muslims, rolling out mass deportations, and pardoning January 6 rioters. Seventy-three of the 78 emails the campaign sent reporters in November mentioned Trump or “MAGA Republicans.” The approach is underpinned by a belief that Trump is no electoral juggernaut. It’s conventional wisdom that with every new indictment, Trump’s support grows. But while this is true among Republicans, it is not among independents. One Politico survey showed half of independents thought that Trump should be imprisoned if convicted in the Justice Department’s case about his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election. After the New York Times got a lot of attention in early November with a set of polls showing Biden behind in five of six crucial states, a far-less-noticed follow-up described another finding: There would be a decisive swing toward Biden in the battlegrounds if Trump were convicted. In the view of many in the Biden camp, Trump is losing altitude among the broader electorate. And the 2024 general election is almost certain to unfold in the shadow of a procession of embarrassing courtroom appearances. Many Democrats think the party is better off focusing on pocketbook issues and policy than on Trump’s threat to American governance. Biden thinks he can sell both messages. Last year, over many Democrats’ objections that it would be a distraction, he delivered a major speech about democracy just ahead of the midterm elections. He still feels vindicated by the results of those elections, in which Democrats defied all expectations by holding the Senate and limiting Republican gains in the House, and believes Americans have yet to render their final political judgment on Trump over his insurrection. At the same time, Biden has shown enthusiasm for making a straightforward economic contrast with Trump, particularly in going after the ex-president’s tax cut for high earners and some Republicans’ interest in cutting Social Security and Medicare. When both candidates visited the Detroit area during the United Auto Workers strike, Biden’s campaign circulated an ad that began, “He says he stands with autoworkers. But as president, Donald Trump passed tax breaks for his rich friends while automakers shuttered their plants.” Over images of Trump on a golf course and Biden greeting workers, it concluded, “Manufacturing is coming back to Michigan because Joe Biden doesn’t just talk — he delivers.” Beyond the economy and Trump’s lean into fascism — early this month, he declined to give Sean Hannity reassurance that he wouldn’t govern as a dictator — it’s abortion that’s most likely to play a fundamental role in shaping the electorate. Democrats have already made it the centerpiece of an argument about individual liberties. Almost immediately after the first GOP primary debate, the campaign pushed out an ad featuring Trump crowing about ending Roe and endorsing punishment for women who get abortions while Ron DeSantis talked about signing abortion bans. There is increasing confidence around Biden that the final electoral calculus could come down to a formulation as simple as “Democracy and Dobbs,” as Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff has reportedly suggested. The grim lot of an incumbent seeking reelection is to confront the image of himself that has been absorbed in the American psyche. George W. Bush was dumb; Obama was an out-of-touch elitist; Trump was a corrupt lunatic. Biden is old. His age has been the single most commonly cited knock on him in poll after poll, and it’s now an active concern for fully three-quarters of voters. Among those who interact with him regularly, it’s obvious the president is physically slower but still fit — he bikes often at his beach house — and mentally sharp. Some think that his softer, muddier diction is related to his stutter. Others still talk occasionally about how tired Biden got while running in 2019 and concede that other effects of his seniority have emerged. At a September reception in New York, Biden repeated lines about the white-supremacist riot in Charlottesville and the genesis of his last campaign almost verbatim, just a few minutes apart. He appears in front of cameras daily, but at some closed-door fundraisers, staffers have asked donors for questions in advance, then given them index cards off which to read those questions, so Biden can prepare. Other aides have monitored his walking routes since he tripped over a sandbag at a graduation ceremony last spring, and he has sometimes used a short staircase to enter and exit Air Force One near its underside rather than the familiar higher steps near the cockpit. There’s no consensus among Biden’s supporters about how to address his age. (As they grouse about how much the issue has obscured the substantive achievements of his presidency, some aides have jokingly circulated fake news articles about Biden’s seniority, generated by ChatGPT, to make a point about how repetitive and unoriginal the media coverage has been.) A flurry of advice and research from officials and strategists across the party looking for a compelling way to address the problem has produced only ideas with marginal impact. One finding, for example, is that when Biden uses “fighting words” that imply vigor on Americans’ behalf — say, against big pharma or Dobbs — voters perk up. In Wilmington, Flaherty has taken up the task of overseeing the effort to sell a positive, robust image of the ultimate analog candidate to a multi-platform audience — an expansion of his 2020 job. In the years since that election, he has thought plenty about what succeeded and what definitely didn’t. “For every dumb idea that didn’t work, there was a dumb idea that did work,” he told me, sitting in a glass-enclosed meeting room. Flaherty, a 32-year-old from outside Boston who’d joined Biden’s last campaign after Beto O’Rourke’s fizzled out, had led a team that tried getting Biden to host a regular podcast during the height of the pandemic: “The podcast did not work.” It trumpeted virtual meet and greets between Biden and supporters — “We tried to do virtual rope lines. Looking back, you’re like, That is so stupid.” But he saw opportunity in the way the campaign had designed interactivity (like chats and donation and reaction buttons) into Biden’s livestreamed speeches, which kept voters coming back. At his aides’ prodding, Biden has embraced Dark Brandon — the glowing-eyes meme about his legislative superpowers. More prominently, the operation is finding a larger public role for Vice-President Harris and a range of surrogates whose emergence can’t come soon enough for Democrats worried about Biden’s own ability to connect on the stump. Also: more sustained relationships between the campaign and influencers who can disseminate talking points and videos to their followers. The idea is to create a volunteer pro-Biden army that feels bought into the effort and that can pitch the candidate using its own spin on top of the campaign’s slogans. It will work best if the community sees Biden as a character it knows and trusts — a process that has included sending small merch boxes to dedicated fans and making sure the campaign’s public-facing brand feels personalized. He pointed to a yard sign taped to a wall across the hallway. “What we’re doing at the end of the day is we’re selling a vibe; we’re selling a personality,” he said. The sign, which hung above the conference-room table where Fulks was still at his laptop, read TOGETHER WE CAN FINISH THE JOB: “That’s literally his handwriting. It’s like, How do we put a little bit of Joe Biden into everything? He is an empathetic, kind person, and people can see that. And then the other side of the personality is the Dark Brandon stuff — he’s fucking shit up.” The idea isn’t to make Biden, the octogenarian face of the political Establishment, go viral but rather to remind voters of all stripes why they like him. The best-performing video of the last campaign (according to its internal metrics) was a heartwarming clip of Biden giving a young Nevada boy named Shamar his flag lapel pin. And yet Biden’s age has proved inescapable, and the closest thing to an agreed-upon way to address it is to detail what Biden has accomplished in office as part of an argument about his age begetting experience. “If I were of his age, I’d say, ‘Listen, this is what you get with this age. I’ve been around this place for 50 years!’” said Murphy. “‘As a senator, as a chair, as a VP, as a president, there’s nothing I haven’t seen.’ And I’d be aggressive on that front.
I wouldn’t be defensive.” Biden knows the story line isn’t going anywhere. For now, he has been content to make light of the fact that, if reelected, he would be eight years older than any predecessor was at the beginning of a term. In the fall, he told backers in Manhattan, “I’ve never been more optimistic about our country’s future in the 800 years I’ve served.” Some of Biden’s advisers believe one more answer lies in reminding Americans of Trump’s own advanced age. A return to the traditional campaign trail is almost certainly still months away. This follows the lead of Obama, who didn’t start campaigning for reelection until the spring of 2012. Yet it’s also a bet that Biden is unlikely to be the central story of the coming election. Trump’s totalitarian turn and legal travails are almost certain to dominate the news — mirroring how in 2020 Biden had an advantage in lying relatively low and modeling sanity. Biden’s implicit wager is that, atypically for an incumbent, this race will not just be a referendum on him but also on his opponent. When I put this notion to a top Democratic power broker in Washington — someone who is sympathetic to Biden but hardly a cheerleader — he shrugged in agreement. “The preoccupation for the people who matter in this election — the people in that core group of states — will be whether they want to go back to having Trump as president,” he said. Sure, Biden is 81, but “what’s the alternative to Biden? If the alternative is Trump, maybe I prefer old to chaos or the undermining of the Republic.” Still, Biden will have to outline for voters the reasons to support him — not just vote against Trump. One very senior Democrat in regular contact with the inner circle suggested that the president meet disenchanted members of his base where they are. Biden’s pitch can’t be “‘Joe Biden should be on Mount Rushmore.’ It should be realistic,” he said. “It’s ‘He’s done good things, and it’s him or the end of democracy.’”  Want more stories like this one?
