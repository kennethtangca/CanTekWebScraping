,,Deepfake video promotes Canadian investment scam,"""The natural resources of the country should belong to the people and the residents of Canada should receive income from their sale,"" Trudeau appears to say in a video advertisement posted on Facebook on April 19, 2023. This video also includes clips of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) anchor Aarti Pole explaining that Petro-Canada, a Canadian oil and gas brand, has launched a new investment platform available to all residents of the country. ""More and more residents are learning about the new platform and are starting to earn thousands of dollars a month using just their phones,"" Pole says. The ad was viewed more than 15,000 times, while a similar video promoting an investment opportunity with Petro-Canada received 7,000 views. Petro-Canada was once a public Crown corporation until it was privatized in 1991 and then merged with Suncor Energy in 2009. Mita Adesanya, a spokeswoman for Suncor, confirmed to AFP in a May 1 email that the offer advertised in the video is not legitimate. The link in the posts sharing the ads is also suspicious. It takes users to a site claiming to be based in New Zealand that includes a form to input personal information to receive a ""specialist consultation."" CBC spokeswoman Kerry Kelly told AFP in a May 1 email that clips in the ad featuring Pole never aired on the network. ""These are more examples of the fake news stories and images we've been seeing,"" Kelly said. AFP has fact-checked several posts impersonating Canada's public broadcaster to spread false claims. Nor did Trudeau endorse the purported investment platform. A reverse-image search of a screenshot from the clip leads to a video of the prime minister in New Brunswick on March 31. In the video, he is discussing the deaths of a family who attempted to cross the Canada-US border the day before and does not mention natural resources or investment opportunities.     A deepfake is a piece of synthetic media altered using artificial intelligence to create a false narrative, which can in some cases be deceptive. WonSook Lee, a professor at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, said the term comes from ""deep learning,"" a multi-layered form of artificial intelligence (AI) meant to emulate the human brain which enables a computer to learn from the data it consumes. This setup allows a program take in an image, audio or video, synthesize the data from the file and then use that analysis to create a new piece of media that mimics the original's characteristics. Deep learning is different from other forms of AI because of its ability to adapt as it consumes more data. ""So, if we have the wrong data, we can put all these things inside the system and make it better,"" she said. Lee said the Facebook ad is an easily spotted deepfake, pointing to the way the words Pole and Trudeau are supposedly saying do not align with the movements of their mouths. She said the fabrication was likely produced using a segment-based model, where only parts of the video are synthesized and mimicked, leading to the disconnect between the lips, the audio and the rest of the face in the final product. Lee warned that as the technology used to create video deepfakes becomes more refined, it will become easier to spread misinformation. ""Sooner or later there will be technology to make everything much more connected, after that I won't be able to distinguish,"" she said.

,,"Say hello to Justin Trudeau, the world's newest oil executive","The Canadian prime minister presents himself as a climate hero. By promising to nationalise the Kinder Morgan pipeline, he reveals his true self In case anyone wondered, this is how the world ends: with the cutest, progressivest, boybandiest leader in the world going fully in the tank for the oil industry. Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Tuesday that it would nationalize the Kinder Morgan pipeline running from the tar sands of Alberta to the tidewater of British Columbia. It will fork over at least $4.5bn in Canadian taxpayers’ money for the right to own a 60-year-old pipe that springs leaks regularly, and for the right to push through a second pipeline on the same route – a proposal that has provoked strong opposition. That opposition has come from three main sources. First are many of Canada’s First Nations groups, who don’t want their land used for this purpose without their permission, and who fear the effects of oil spills on the oceans and forests they depend on. Second are the residents of Canada’s west coast, who don’t want hundreds of additional tankers plying the narrow inlets around Vancouver on the theory that eventually there’s going to be an oil spill. And third are climate scientists, who point out that even if Trudeau’s pipeline doesn’t spill oil into the ocean, it will spill carbon into the atmosphere. Lots of carbon: Trudeau told oil executives last year that “no country would find 173bn barrels of oil in the ground and just leave it there”. That’s apparently how much he plans to dig up and burn – and if he’s successful, the one half of 1% of the planet that is Canadian will have awarded to itself almost one-third of the remaining carbon budget between us and the 1.5 degree rise in temperature the planet drew as a red line in Paris. There’s no way of spinning the math that makes that okay – Canadians already emit more carbon per capita than Americans. Hell, than Saudi Arabians. Is this a clever financial decision that will somehow make Canada rich? Certainly not in the long run. Cleaning up the tar sands complex in Alberta – the biggest, ugliest scar on the surface of the earth – is already estimated to cost more than the total revenues generated by all the oil that’s come out of the ground. Meanwhile, when something goes wrong, Canada is now on the hook: when BP tarred the Gulf of Mexico, the US was at least able to exact billions of dollars in fines to help with the cleanup. Canada will get to sue itself. No, this is simply a scared prime minister playing politics. He’s worried about the reaction in Alberta if the pipe is not built, and so he has mortgaged his credibility. His predecessor, Stephen Harper, probably would not have dared try – the outcry from environmentalists and First Nations would have been too overwhelming. But Trudeau is banking on the fact that his liberal charm will soothe things over. Since he’s got Trump to point to – a true climate denier – maybe he’ll get away with it. But it seems like a bad bet to me. Faced with the same situation – a revolt over the Keystone XL pipeline – Barack Obama delayed for several years to avoid antagonizing either side. He ultimately decided he couldn’t defend the climate cost of building it, and so became the first world leader to explicitly reject a big piece of infrastructure on global warming grounds. Trudeau has made the exact opposite call, and now we’ll see if pipeline opponents cave. I was in Vancouver two weeks ago to help activists raise money for lawyers, and I would guess that the civil disobedience will continue – so far, two members of parliament have been arrested, an escalation we’ve never seen even in the States. Coast Salish elders have built a “watch house” along the pipeline route and, as at Standing Rock, other native activists have been pouring in – I’m guessing that making this petro-colonialism officially state sponsored will only harden people’s resolution. The showdown will be powerfully symbolic: kayaktivists, for instance, have paddled peacefully around the pipeline’s terminal, at least until Kinder Morgan put up an ugly razor wire barrier in the middle of the harbor. Now it’s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money. We know now how history will remember Justin Trudeau: not as a dreamy progressive, but as one more pathetic employee of the richest, most reckless industry in the planet’s history.

,,Suncor to keep Petro-Canada retail business after comprehensive review of business," Suncor Energy Inc. says
it has decided to keep its Petro-Canada retail business, the company announced Tuesday, after a comprehensive review concluded Suncor was unlikely to receive the price it wanted for the chain. Suncor undertook a review of Petro-Canada after reaching a deal earlier this year with activist investor Elliott Investment Management LP, which had expressed frustration with the company's performance. At the company's investor day in Toronto on Tuesday, interim CEO Kris Smith -- who assumed leadership of the company following former CEO Mark Little's resignation in July -- said part of that review included inviting 17 different parties to submit expressions of interest in a possible purchase of the chain. Smith said only a third of those approached were interested, and none were willing to pay what Suncor believes the chain is worth. (The company pegs Petro-Canada's net value at between $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion.) ""Upon review of the submitted proposals, it was clear that a premium valuation ... was not realistic,"" Smith said. ""Despite the strength and attractiveness of our retail business, there's limited appetite for an all-cash purchase at what we would consider a significant market premium."" Smith said as part of its review, Suncor also sought the opinions of investors, whose views on the benefits of retaining the retail network generally aligned with the feelings of management and the board. ""And that is that the Suncor retail business is a unique business with significant scale and an advantaged network,"" Smith said. ""It is supported by broad consumer appeal and a market-leading brand."" Petro-Canada is currently the leading fuel brand in Canada with 18 per cent market share, and 1,600 locations in Canada. Smith said Suncor has concluded that rather than selling the chain off, the company's best move is to ""retain and maximize"" it through expanding strategic partnerships in non-fuel related businesses such as quick service restaurants, convenience stores, loyalty partnerships and electric vehicle charging networks. Suncor believes that by working to improve its retail offering, it can boost earnings from its retail segment by 40 per cent by 2027, Smith said. The decision to keep the retail business came as Suncor announced its production outlook and capital program for 2023. Capital expenditures in 2023 are forecast to be between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion. The company says it expects total production next year is expected to be between 740,000 and 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Refinery throughput for 2023 is expected to be 430,000 to 445,000 barrels per day with refinery utilization between 92 and 96 per cent. Refined product sales are expected to be between 550,000 and 580,000 barrels per day. Phil Skolnick, an analyst with Eight Capital, said the 2023 guidance reflects rising capital expenditures as well as production estimates that came in below analysts' expectations. He said he views Suncor's latest guidance as a negative that will likely weigh on the company's share price going forward. ""We maintain our sell rating,"" Skolnick said in a note. On Tuesday, Suncor also updated investors on what it is doing to improve safety at its oilsands operations in light of a recent string of fatalities at work sites. These efforts include reducing the size of its contractor work force by 20 per cent and increasing the number of supervisors, installing collision prevention and fatigue management technology across all of its mine sites by the end of 2023, and linking safety performance more closely with compensation. ""We know we have to do better. I'm confident we can achieve best-in-class safety throughout our entire company,"" Smith said.

,,Petro-Canada,"     ARTICLE Article by
Sasha Yusufali, Larry R. Pratt Published Online
November 16, 2009 Last Edited
December 16, 2013 Petro-Canada, created by the federal government in the mid-1970s as Canada's national oil company, was the offspring of the world energy crisis, Canadian ECONOMIC NATIONALISM, and a tradition of state-supported development of the country's costly energy frontier. Petro-Canada is involved in ""upstream"" (exploration and development) and ""downstream"" (refining and marketing) activities. It has major interests in western Canadian production, the Alberta oil sands, the Hibernia and Terra Nova projects of offshore Newfoundland and various international locations, and controls nearly one-fifth of Canada's oil refining and gasoline market (seePETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY). Employing more than 6000 people around the world, Petro-Canada is one of Canada's largest oil and gas companies. Petro-Canada was created in the mid-1970s, a period when energy issues became the focus of a broad debate in Canada between Prime Minister Pierre TRUDEAU's Liberal minority government and its critics. Trudeau was assailed by nationalists and by the NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY, which after the 1972 federal election held the balance of power in the HOUSE OF COMMONS. The PETROLEUM INDUSTRY was overwhelmingly under foreign - mostly American - control, the Canadian Arctic was coming under corporate pressure because of the recent discovery of oil in Alaska, and Canada's ENERGY POLICIES appeared to be increasingly oriented to North American rather than domestic needs. Many national governments had already established state oil companies in the attempt to gain more control over, and knowledge about, the international oil industry. Such companies were used to ensure the security of supplies, to enhance the collection of revenues and to give governments better information about world energy markets, yet they were costly to set up and, over time, tended to become almost indistinguishable from their private-sector counterparts. The Trudeau cabinet initially rejected the idea of establishing a Canadian state oil company on grounds of cost and efficiency. However, in the fall of 1973 the global structure of oil supply collapsed, oil prices quadrupled, and the major oil companies saw their holdings nationalized in the Arab oil-exporting countries of the Middle East. The resulting uncertainty about having continued oil imports forced Ottawa to reassess its assumptions. Canada, though a temporary net exporter, was vulnerable to a cut-off of imported supplies for Québec and the Atlantic provinces, and it urgently needed to know more about its potential to produce energy from its frontier areas (seePETROLEUM SUPPLY AND DEMAND). The minority Liberals were threatened with parliamentary defeat by the NDP unless they acted to protect consumers and to set up a Crown-owned petroleum company. More radical voices were calling for the NATIONALIZATION of the entire oil industry, and the oil-consuming provinces were strong supporters of federal intervention to enhance the security of supply. Trudeau's government therefore accepted an NDP motion late in October 1973 calling, among other things, for the creation of a national oil company. The Petro-Canada Act was passed in 1975 after an acrimonious debate in Parliament and created a new CROWN CORPORATION. This corporation was equipped with broad powers to carry out exploration and development and a comprehensive mandate to acquire imported oil supplies; engage in energy research and development; and go into ""downstream"" activities such as refining and marketing. The new corporation was established with an initial $1.5 billion in capital and preferential access to debt capital as ""an agent of Her Majesty,"" thus reducing its cost of capital; but the Liberal government also drafted the legislation so as to give Ottawa authority over Petro-Canada's capital budget and its corporate strategy. The government wanted to keep its new Crown entity as its policy arm and to prevent it from striking out on its own: it wanted Petro-Canada mainly to be active on the frontiers - the oil sands, the Arctic, the East Coast offshore areas - and not in the conventional oil and gas sector in Western Canada. Since setting up headquarters in the hostile culture of Calgary in 1976, with Maurice STRONG, the prime minister's friend, as the company's first chair, Petro-Canada's principal object has been corporate growth. It has been oriented to growth rather than profitability because this has served several management interests. Growth was necessary if Petro-Canada was to carry out its job of exploring and developing the frontier oil and gas basins, and also have the autonomy from Ottawa to make its own decisions. Moreover, from its first day of operations, Petro-Canada was the target of a campaign by right-wing oilmen and the federal Conservative Party - then led by Joe CLARK - to disband the company. Clark was a native Albertan who understood the West but grossly underestimated the strength of nationalist sentiment and Petro-Canada's symbolic importance in the rest of the country. Clark's threat to ""dismantle"" rather than merely privatize Petro-Canada spurred the company's managers to expand their domain by making a series of corporate acquisitions, the overall effect of which was to make the Crown oil company one of the largest players in the industry, far too large for any government to break up. Petro-Canada survived the brief minority Conservative government headed by Clark in 1979-80, the years of the ""second oil crisis,"" because it was able to link its own fate to Canadians' fears about the supply, price and ownership of energy. It held a share in the big Hibernia oil find off Newfoundland and was a partner in the Syncrude oil sands venture in Fort McMurray, Alberta, both of which were identified in the public's mind with security and national control. The Liberals returned to power in 1980 and soon introduced their controversial NATIONAL ENERGY PROGRAM (NEP), which included plans for a greatly expanded Petro-Canada, ""as large as any multinational,"" the federal Energy Minister stated. Its roles under the NEP were multiple and costly. It was to advise the government, import oil, accelerate oil sands exploitation, act as a catalyst in frontier exploration and development, collect economic rents and other benefits, and help ""Canadianize"" the entire oil industry. It also had substantial ""downstream"" assets to operate. All of these mandates entailed large expenditures for delayed returns, expenditures that could only be justified under the assumption - which was conventional wisdom in most governments - that oil would be insecure and very costly throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This assumption proved to be incorrect and by 1981-82 the world oil industry was in its worst crisis of overproduction, falling prices and glutted markets in 50 years. The oil-exporting countries lost their control of prices, which plummeted from over $40 per barrel to less than $10 per barrel in the space of a few months. In these circumstances of overcapacity, the case for having state oil companies that could take the longer view and focus on security of supply was much less persuasive than it had been. Well before Brian MULRONEY's Conservatives took power in 1984, Petro-Canada had begun to look to its own resources and to fashion a strategy to manage its growing empire on conservative, market-driven principles. Ottawa no longer intervened in company policy. Petro-Canada wrote off several of its costlier frontier projects, and, in an especially rigorous move, summarily fired 2000 employees - nearly 25% of its workforce - in response to falling prices. Petro-Canada's need for new equity capital and management's desire to be freed of the obligation to serve as a policy arm of the state pointed to a predictable outcome: the corporation, with its estimated $6 billion in taxpayer-owned assets, must be privatized. Partial privatization began in 1991 when Petro-Canada listed on stock exchanges across the country, selling about 30% of its shares, and continued in 1995 when its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. By that time, private investors held about 81% of the shares in Petro-Canada and the government of Canada held the remaining 19%. Since no single investor could hold more than 10% of the public offering, foreign ownership was restricted to 25% of the public float (50% starting in 1996 while the voting limit remained at 25%), and the federal government refused any intervention in Petro-Canada's affairs, control of the company remained firmly in the hands of the operating management. In the years that followed, Petro-Canada streamlined its operations by selling off ownership interest in buildings and other assets judged non-essential to its continued operation while, at the same time, strengthening its operations in core areas such as with the acquisition of Amerada Hess Canada Ltd in 1996 for $735 million, by which it gained significant proven oil and gas reserves in the process. In 2000, the 25th year of Petro-Canada's existence, the company achieved its highest earnings to that date, posting a net income of $893 million (9.5% of revenues), almost a four-fold increase over the previous year's earnings of $233 million (3.8%). Petro-Canada completed its largest purchase to date in May of 2002, the acquisition of the majority of Veba Oil's international oil and gas operations for $3.2 billion, nearly doubling its output of barrels of oil per day. The Canadian government's desire to further decrease its, and thus the taxpayers', participation in the marketplace led to the sale of its remaining share of 19% of Petro-Canada in September 2004 for almost $3.2 billion, bringing to a successful conclusion the privatization that was started in 1991. In March 2009, Petro-Canada and Suncor, a Canadian oil development and exploration company employing about 6500 people, announced their plans to merge operations in a transaction that would see combined revenues rise to $54.6 billion (US $43.4 billion). Petro-Canada is an integrated oil and gas company engaged in both upstream and downstream activities. On the upstream side of the business, it maintains extensive Canadian as well as international exploration and production interests, which include, among others, the Terra Nova and Hibernia production facilities off Canada's East Coast, various oilsands projects in Alberta's North, and various locations in the North Sea. For the 2003 fiscal year, the company reported record operating revenues of $27.6 billion and a net income of $3.1 billion (11% of revenues). Its downstream business (refining, marketing, and distribution) contributed almost 59% of net revenues with the remainder coming from its upstream operations, which are grouped as follows: North American Natural Gas, East Coast Canada, Oil Sands, and International. On the downstream side, which accounts for two-thirds of the company's business, Petro-Canada operates two refineries located in Edmonton and Montréal, and a lubricants plant in Mississauga, Ont. Across the country, the company has a vast network of retail outlets, numbering 1323 in 2008, 60% of them in Ontario and Québec combined, whereas the majority of its 233 truck stop locations are located in Canada's three westernmost provinces. The former crown corporation is an active supporter of the community and is well-known for its support of the Olympic Torch run leading up to the 1988 Calgary Olympics. The proceeds of the merchandise sold during this time were used to establish the Olympic Torch Scholarship Fund, which since 1988 has paid more than $6 million to more than 2000 Canadian athletes and coaches. The company is also a major donor to amateur athlete development efforts in connection with the 2010 Olympic Games. Recognizing the impact of its operations on Aboriginal communities, the company created an Aboriginal Relations Team in 2001 to better understand the needs and sensitivities of Canada's First Nations. One of the key outcomes of this process was the creation of the position of Manager of Aboriginal Affairs, who oversees the company's efforts in this regard, including the appointment of advisors from the Aboriginal community to help the company implement its plans. Petro-Canada's exploration and production activities, by their nature, have an impact on the environment, something the company has long recognized and acted upon, for example by combining forces with the Pembina Institute for Appropriate Development to create the ""Alberta Ecotrust."" In Atlantic Canada, Petro-Canada is the major private-sector organization involved in the Conservation Corps of Newfoundland and Labrador, which carries out residential energy assessments and promotes awareness of climate change.

,,Exploring the Historical Rift: The Trudeau Legacy and Alberta’s Energy Sector,"Thunder Bay – POLITICAL Opinion – The Canadian political landscape has been marked by several contentious episodes, but few have had as lasting an impact on Alberta as the National Energy Program (NEP) initiated in the 1980s under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and then Energy Minister Marc LaLonde. This federal initiative, aimed at increasing Canadian ownership in the Oil and Gas Sector, led to significant economic and political repercussions in Alberta, reshaping the province’s relationship with the federal government for decades. The National Energy Program was embraced by Dome Petroleum. The company created a Canadian subsidiary Dome Canada in order to gain access to the federal grants. It was the only company in the Oil Patch to take the policies of the NEP and take advantage of them. Dome Petroleum also became one of the largest financial failures when it almost defaulted on almost $5 billion in loans from all the major Canadian and many US banks. Petro Canada was one of the creations coming out of the NEP. However most of the oilpatch in Alberta simply saw the federal program as “NEPOTISM”. Today growing numbers of Albertans are seeing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Carbon Tax as the modern day NEP. Alberta has made, in recent years a lot of effort to diversify its economy. Moves into Hydrogen and wind energy are two areas. Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is starting to be seen, by some, as taking a page out of his father’s political playbook. The move this time is still against Alberta, but instead of increasing Canadian ownership, the Liberal Prime Minister’s stated goal is meeting Canada’s climate change goals. This move is causing a political backlash in Alberta. When the National Energy Program was imposed, the unemployment rate in Alberta rose from 3.7 percent to 12.4 percent, the bankruptcy rate in Alberta rose by 150 percent, and Alberta’s losses were estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion. Alberta is not the same province it was back in the 1980s, but Albertans remember the economic and social impact of the NEP. Today many are feeling that way about the moves, often unilateral that they see impacting their futures. The overall impact politically and economically of the Carbon Tax and other measures is likely to be similar today to what happened in the 1980s. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau left federal politics before the Liberals under John Turner were reduced to 40 seats in the House of Commons. Today Justin Trudeau is at the political low end of popularity with polls suggesting 74% of Canadians would like him to resign. The federal Conservatives are at a whopping 40% in the polls compared to the Liberals at 22%. The question arises, is Justin Trudeau working to rebuild his political popularity by using the wedge issue of his carbon tax against Alberta and the federal Conservatives led by Pierre Poilievre? Alberta as far as the Liberal Party is concerned is a political desert. The Provincial Liberal Party has no seats in the legislature and in the 2023 general election, the Alberta Liberals got its lowest vote record in its history with just 0.24%. There are only two Liberals serving federally in Alberta, one from Calgary and one from Edmonton. So looking at history, as said, ‘If you don’t study history, you are doomed to repeat it”. The NEP, introduced in 1980, sought to redistribute wealth from the oil-rich provinces to the federal government, with an emphasis on Canadian ownership and control in the oil and gas sector. This program, however, was perceived in Alberta as an economic attack, creating deep-seated tensions that have persisted over the years. For Alberta, rich in oil and gas resources, the NEP was nothing short of an economic calamity. The program led to a drastic reduction in investment in the province’s energy sector, causing a virtual shutdown of its economy. This period is remembered as one of significant hardship in Alberta, fueling resentment towards the federal government. Political Unrest and the Rise of the Reform Party The economic distress and perceived federal overreach under the NEP catalyzed political unrest in Alberta. This environment contributed to the formation of the Reform Party of Canada, a political movement born out of Western Canadian discontent. The party aimed to address the concerns of Albertans who felt marginalized by the federal policies of the time. The Trudeau-Alberta Tension: A Historical Perspective The NEP era entrenched a perception among many Albertans of the federal Liberals as imposing “Eastern views” on their province. For years, this sentiment eroded the Liberal Party’s political prospects in Alberta, with the party struggling to gain significant support in the region. Comparing Past and Present: Justin Trudeau’s Approach to Alberta Today, questions arise about whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is following in his father’s footsteps in his dealings with Alberta, particularly under the leadership of Premier Smith. While there are parallels in the federal government’s involvement in energy policies, the context and challenges of the present day differ significantly from those of the 1980s. The Future of Federal-Alberta Relations As Canada continues to navigate complex energy and environmental issues, the relationship between the federal government and Alberta remains a topic of keen interest and importance. How Justin Trudeau’s administration engages with Alberta and addresses the legacy of the NEP will be crucial in shaping the future of this longstanding and dynamic relationship. The goal should be bringing all Canadians along in moving toward a carbon neutral future. While there are those who are putting emotion over logic and denying the overall long-term impact of climate change, the science is there, and the efforts we need to do together are apparent. It is the real job of the government leaders to continue to educate, illuminate and be open and transparent about the entire process we are all working on to reduce our impact on the earth. We all live on this planet and there isn’t a Planet B.

,,Did Canada buy an oil pipeline in fear of being sued by China?,"The logic to Trudeau’s action may lie in an obscure and overlooked 2014 agreement to ensure China got a pipeline built Why is Justin Trudeau buying a pipeline? Canada’s government announced yesterday it was planning to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5bn. This pipeline – which transports oil from Alberta’s tar sands to the western coast of British Columbia – is at the centre of a bitter political war that shows no signs of abating. Standing in opposition are the government of British Columbia, the environmental movement, coastal communities and many indigenous groups. Collectively, they’re alarmed about the possibilities of oil spills and exacerbating climate change. Pressing for the pipeline is the oil industry and the governments of Canada and Alberta – whose premier, Rachel Notley, crowed after the decision: “Pick up those tools, folks, we have a pipeline to build.” Trudeau’s ferocious desire to build the pipeline at any cost seems bizarre on the face of it. Ostensibly, his government claims the pipeline is good for the Canadian economy. But the pipeline will be shipping unrefined oil – known as bitumen – to be refined in the US and Asia. This will cost oil refinery jobs in Canada, which is where most employment in the oil industry exists. Canada has been closing refineries for years now. The pipeline will only accelerate this trend. Moreover, developing the oil sands ensures Canada will never come close to meeting its commitments to the Paris climate accord. In 2015, Trudeau promised to cut emissions dramatically: 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. But most of the oil in Alberta’s tar sands will have to stay in the ground to prevent a global warming catastrophe. So what’s going on? The logic to Trudeau’s action may lie in an obscure and often overlooked agreement called the Canada-China Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (Fipa). This agreement, ratified in 2014, was negotiated by the previous Harper government. It was passed without a vote in Parliament. Fipa, which remains in place until 2045, was signed to ensure that China got a pipeline built from Alberta to BC, among other benefits. Yet this Fipa is the sort of agreement that undermines the sovereignty of nations to the benefit of private interests. Fipas are Canada’s name for bilateral investment treaties, which are frequently used by corporations around the world to challenge public policies or community decisions that interfere with their ability to make money. Canada’s first Fipa took the form of a single chapter in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Since then, Canada has paid out $160m to US corporations who challenged public decisions, including environmental policy. Canadian mining companies are using Fipas with developing countries to claim damages from community opposition to unwanted mega-projects. In the case of the Fipa with China, it notably allows Chinese energy companies to challenge local, provincial and federal policies or laws that interfere with their “right” to make a profit from energy projects. So any environmental regulations, or halted pipelines, or First Nations land claims, could be subject to lawsuits brought by Chinese corporate interests. (Conversely, Canadian companies operating in China have the same rights to do the same thing over there.) A clause in the Fipa, called Investor State Arbitration, gives them this capacity. “More troubling, there is no requirement in the treaty for the federal government to make public the fact of a Chinese investor’s lawsuit against Canada until an award has been issued by a tribunal,” Osgoode Hall international investment law professor Gus Van Harten has noted. “This means that the federal government could settle the lawsuit by paying out public money before an award is issued, and we would never know.” This is no small threat: a few years ago, a Chinese insurance company launched a $2bn arbitration claim against Belgium under a foreign investment protection treaty. And in 2016, the energy giant TransCanada sued the US government for cancelling the Keystone XL oil pipeline. TransCanada was seeking $15bn. Trudeau is desperate to keep China happy. In 2016, his government began negotiating a free trade agreement with China. At the time, the Globe and Mail reported, “a senior Chinese official said this will require Canadian concessions on investment restrictions and a commitment to build an energy pipeline to the coast”. Less than a year later, Trudeau approved the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. Talks for the free trade agreement are ongoing. Now he has bought that pipeline, and will have to live with the political fallout, which will likely include protesters, court cases and other acts of civil disobedience. In what might be a strategy to avoid lawsuits from Chinese companies that may result in massive secret payouts, Trudeau’s government may find itself arresting Canadians.

,,," The Canadian government does not directly own oil companies, but it does have ownership stakes in some oil and gas companies through its Crown corporations, such as the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV) and the Canada Pension Not anymore. Funny enough, Petro-Canada started out as a Crown Corporation in 1975 by the Liberals under PM Trudeau I, with support from the NDP under Tommy Douglas, as part of the federal government’s drive for Canadians to benefit from the rising oil prices, especially given how the American corporate interests had long controlled the extraction of the Albertan oil reserves and geared said extraction to American markets. Unfortunately, Petro-Canada was privatized in 1991 by the PCs under Mulroney as part of the 1980s privatization and deregulation craze, which together with the austerity meas    The Alberta government owns most of the oil in Canada, which really annoys the federal Liberal government. The Saskatchewan government owns most of the rest. The First Nations own all the oil under their reservations. Private landowners own quite a lot, but in the late 19th century the Crown began reserving mineral rights on land they bought from the First Nations, so it depends on when the land was homesteaded. The federal government owns the oil in the Northern Territories, but the Native people have a claim on it. In BC the government didn’t sign treaties with most of the First Nations, so    Not any more. The first Trudeau government created Petro-Canada, but after it lost somewhere between $8 billion and $16 billion of the taxpayers’ money (we will never get a proper accounting), subsequent governments sold it off in stages to private investors. Despite what some people believe, these were both Liberal and Conservative governments. Now it is owned by the giant oil sands producer, Suncor, which uses it as a marketing brand for the company’s products. The Canadian government also sold off most of its other companies because they were all losing money which had to be made up by the t   ",www.quora.com,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-Canadian-government-own-oil-companies,

,,LNG Canada finally gives Trudeau the energy sector win he badly needed,"The energy sector hasn't seen many outright victories over the last number of years under the Trudeau government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet approved the Pacific NorthWest LNG project, only to see the proponent cancel its $36 billion investment. TransCanada pulled out of the Energy East pipeline project over regulatory pressure and the Trans Mountain expansion is mired in new legal troubles. But on Tuesday, Canada's energy sector marked a win. So did the prime minister. The proponents of LNG Canada made a positive final investment decision: a stunning commitment of $40 billion that ultimately will be the largest private sector investment in the country's history. Trudeau couldn't contain his glee over that fact during the news conference announcing the investment. He repeated it three times over the course of his speech — smiling a little wider each time he said it. The project will liquify and transport natural gas from the low-cost Montney gas fields that straddle the Alberta-B.C. border to energy-starved markets in Asia, many of which are heavily dependent on coal to keep the lights on. A terminal for the project will be built near Kitimat, B.C., on the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation — First Nations peoples who have endorsed the project and the resulting social and financial benefits that are expected to flow to them. Construction will start right away; all the necessary federal and provincial approvals are in place for both the terminal and the pipeline that will feed it. Tariff relief for some necessary steel components has been granted. And the power supply agreements — B.C. Hydro will supply some clean power to the project — are up and running. ""Today, a few dreams are realized,"" Andy Calitz, the CEO of LNG Canada, said as he announced the company's decision. ""The first one is it validates the reality that, in B.C., projects can be done if they're done in the right way when it comes to resource development through a process of building relationships before we build the project."" ""The second one is we've taken the first [investment in a] British Columbian energy project to show the prime minister that it can be done in Premier Horgan's province,"" he said, to laughter from the crowd. ""That comment was made to unite, not divide."" The last remark was a thinly veiled reference to B.C. Premier John Horgan's continued opposition to the Trans Mountain expansion project — his government has sought to stop it in the courts — but also to the perceived errors of Kinder Morgan, the original proponent of that crude oil pipeline, and to its ill-fated attempts to secure support from coastal B.C. First Nations around the Burnaby terminal. At a glance, the Trans Mountain and LNG Canada projects look rather similar — two massive energy sector construction operations in coastal British Columbia carrying a lot of political weight. But the similarities fade when you take a closer look. With this LNG project, Horgan has proposed generous provincial tax breaks and some relief from the province's carbon tax to encourage its construction. (B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver has already said he is steadfastly opposed to such a move.) Horgan — who opposed LNG development when in opposition — praised the project Tuesday as a game-changer for the province's north, a source of wealth for a region that needs it. ""This is a spectacular day for B.C. I can't stop smiling,"" he said. Haisla Nation Chief Councillor Crystal Smith's eyes brimmed with tears as she watched the project's announcement. She thanked Shell and the other backers for agreeing to build the terminal and the supporting infrastructure near her community. ""I applaud your leadership,"" she told Calitz. And while the Federal Court of Appeal struck down cabinet approvals for Trans Mountain — because it found the constitutionally mandated consultation efforts with Indigenous peoples were inadequate — an entirely different set of B.C. coastal First Nations are praising LNG's outreach efforts. ""You've guided your team and blazed a path for how project development and First Nations communities can come together to create hope and opportunities for generations. We extend our deep gratitude for the investment being made in Haisla Territory."" Twenty-four other First Nations, and their elected band councils, have signed financial agreements related to the project, which will lead to millions of dollars in community support payments, work for First Nations-owned construction businesses, education and jobs. While mayors in Vancouver and Burnaby supported the Federal Court of Appeal case against the Trans Mountain project, Kitimat's mayor, Phil Germuth, was effusive in his praise for LNG. ""They've really shown and set a standard for what it takes to go out and get a project done these days,"" Germuth said of LNG Canada. ""They truly deserve a round of applause for the amount of amazing work that they've done,"" he said. This is exactly how the federal Liberals had hoped to see their energy agenda unfold: oil and gas boosters complying with environmental regulations, securing buy-in from local communities, consulting with First Nations and, in turn, getting government approvals and a green-light to build from regulators. While the success of the Liberals' energy agenda has been fairly limited so far, with LNG Canada Trudeau can claim a victory — even if most of the project's approvals were completed under former prime minister Stephen Harper and his Conservative government. (Trudeau's cabinet approved the Enbridge-backed Line 3 expansion, which has begun construction on the Canadian side of the U.S. border after some regulatory hurdles in Minnesota.) Still, Trudeau did meet three times with senior leaders of Royal Dutch Shell in Davos, Switzerland, in China and, just last month, in New York at the UN — lobbying the multinational consortium of oil and gas companies to commit to an investment. And the fate of that investment was far from certain after a final investment decision was put off in 2016. ""Shell and its partners didn't make this $40 billion investment in Canada as a last resort. It was a choice. It was a vote of confidence in a country that recognizes the need to develop our energy that truly takes the environment in to account and works with Indigenous communities,"" Trudeau said.

,,Trudeau calls LNG project in B.C. the biggest private investment in Canada's history,"LNG Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and B.C. Premier John Horgan unveiled the project at a press conference in Vancouver on Tuesday morning. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canada is celebrating the single largest private investment in Canadian history with the $40-billion liquefied natural-gas export terminal on B.C.’s North Coast. Trudeau was in Vancouver on Tuesday to formally announce the giant energy project’s go-ahead, along with Premier John Horgan, LNG Canada and First Nations leaders.    LNG Canada was given final approval late Monday to move to construction by a consortium of oil-and-gas companies headed by Royal Dutch Shell. Trudeau also announced $275 million in federal support, and pledged that once built, the project will have the lowest carbon intensity of any large-scale LNG facility in the world. “Today’s announcement by LNG Canada represents the single largest private-sector investment project in Canadian history, Trudeau said. “It is a vote of confidence in a country that recognizes the need to develop our energy in a way that takes the environment into account, and that works in meaningful partnership with Indigenous people.” Trudeau said providing Asia with natural gas will help many countries kick their coal habit, and shows Canada’s commitment to combating the problem of climate change by driving down emissions worldwide. “Climate change knows no borders, and as we reduce and replace coal plants around the world, LNG, done properly, done responsibly, here in British Columbia and across Western Canada, that’s good news for all of us,” he said. Start your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion.    “These are the kind of steps we need to take to demonstrate that we are thoughtful about where the world is going and that we are doing it responsibly. And that Canada is a part of it.” Trudeau said the project will create 10,000 jobs and strengthen communities in B.C.’s north. He added that the project will not face trade barriers. “Trade barriers will not be an impediment moving forward on this project. There are specialized components that need to be imported, but there will also be a lot of Canadian steel used in the construction of this plant,” said Trudeau. At the news conference, LNG president Andy Calitz confirmed Canada is “immediately today” moving into construction of the project. Horgan said the $40-billion investment by LNG Canada shows B.C.’s future can balance economic opportunity and job creation with forward-looking environmental action that meets the province’s climate-action goals. “British Columbians want a future that brings opportunities for them and their kids in the communities they call home, while living up to our responsibilities to guarantee clean air, land and water for the generations that follow,” he said. “Ours is a province of unlimited potential, and the responsibility of this generation of British Columbians is to make decisions that embrace and preserve that potential.” The project is expected to generate about $23 billion in revenue for B.C. over 40 years, which the provincial government says will be invested in health care, schools, child care and other key services. Still, not everyone celebrated the announcement Tuesday. B.C. Green party Leader Andrew Weaver said he was “deeply disappointed” that the government went ahead with the project. “Adding such a massive new source of (greenhouse gases) means that the rest of our economy will have to make even more sacrifices to meet our climate targets,” said Weaver. He said he believes B.C. can create far more jobs in other industries that won’t drastically increase emissions. “It breaks my heart that the young people of today must watch as politicians who once professed to champion climate action and a hopeful vision for the future instead succumb to the temptation of short-sighted political wins,” he said. The Sierra Club of B.C. called going ahead with the construction without a credible climate plan “irresponsible” of the B.C. government. “It is irresponsible for the provincial and federal governments to continue to allow new fossil-fuel projects to go ahead without strong, detailed climate plans and accountability mechanisms,” said Jens Wieting, a spokesman for Sierra. “We need a climate test for all major energy projects, a test that stops projects whose carbon footprint makes meeting targets impossible.” Wieting argued that the carbon footprint of LNG Canada’s Kitimat project can’t fit in any climate-action plan that is in line with the central goal of the Paris Agreement — to limit warming to between 1.5 and 2 C. Beyond 2 C, impacts to the planet will be catastrophic, he said. Horgan, who is staunchly opposed to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion because of environmental concerns, insisted that B.C. will meet its emissions targets even with this LNG project, though he didn’t provide a specific plan. Earlier this year, B.C. introduced legislation that includes new targets for dramatic cuts to carbon pollution, aiming for a 40-per-cent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 12 years. B.C. also plans to cut emissions 80 per cent by 2050, but Weaver has argued that may not be possible with the LNG project. Former Liberal premier Christy Clark, whose government pushed for LNG development in B.C., said on Twitter that it was the best day of her professional life. She also thanked the New Democrat government for not blocking the Kitimat project. The project includes a gas-liquefaction plant in Kitimat, and a 670-kilometre pipeline delivering natural gas from the northeast corner of the province. The partners include Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi Corp., Malaysian-owned Petronas, PetroChina Co. and Korean Gas Corp. They delayed the final investment decision in 2016, citing a drop in natural-gas prices. ticrawford@postmedia.com -With files from Rob Shaw and The Canadian Press Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion and encourage all readers to share their views on our articles.

,,National Energy Program,"The National Energy Program (French: Programme énergétique national, NEP) was an energy policy of the Canadian federal government from 1980 to 1985. The economically nationalist policy sought to secure Canadian energy independence, though was strongly opposed by the private sector and the oil-producing Western Canadian provinces, most notably Alberta. Created under the Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on October 28, 1980, following the two oil crises of the 1970s, the NEP had three main objectives: increase ownership of the oil industry by Canadians; price energy fairly for Canadian consumers; and provide Canadian energy self-sufficiency. The NEP was also designed to promote lower prices through price controls; promote exploration for oil in Canada; promote alternative energy sources; and increase federal government revenues from oil sales through a variety of taxes and revenue-sharing with the oil-producing Western Canadian provinces. The NEP proved to be a highly controversial policy initiative and sparked intense opposition and anger in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta. The province's premier, Peter Lougheed, was a vocal opponent of the NEP on the grounds that it interfered with provincial jurisdiction and unfairly deprived Alberta of oil revenue. In 1981, Lougheed and Trudeau reached a revenue-sharing agreement. Opponents claim that due to the NEP, the unemployment rate in Alberta rose from 3.7 percent to 12.4 percent, the bankruptcy rate in Alberta rose by 150 percent, and Alberta's losses were estimated to be between $50 billion and $100 billion (though Alberta's unemployment rate, bankruptcy rate, and revenue losses were also affected by the early 1980s recession and a crash in oil prices). The term ""Western alienation"" was coined as a result of the NEP. The policy was repealed by the newly-elected Progressive Conservative (PC) government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on June 1, 1985. The NEP contributed to the creation and rise of the Western Canadian-based and right-wing populist Reform Party which made a major breakthrough in the 1993 federal election; the Reform Party merged with the PCs in 2003, becoming the Conservative Party which governed Canada from 2006 to 2015. In his preamble to the announcement of the National Energy Program, introduced as part of the October 1980 federal budget, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen echoed concerns by leaders of developed countries regarding the recession that followed both oil crises of the 1970s and the ""deeply troubling air of uncertainty and anxiety"" that was shared by Canadians.[1] The Bank of Canada reported that economic problems had been accelerated and magnified. Inflation was most commonly between 9% and 10% annually,[2] and prime interest rates were over 10%.[3][4] ...ever since the oil crisis of 1973 industrial countries have had to struggle with the problems of inflation and stubbornly high rates of unemployment. In 1979 the world was shaken by a second major oil shock. For the industrial world this has meant a sharp renewal of inflationary forces and real income losses. For the developing world this second oil shock has been a major tragedy. Their international deficits are now three to four times the sum they receive in aid from the rest of the world.... They are not just Canadian problems. ...they are world-wide problems. At the Venice Summit and at meetings of Finance Ministers of the IMF and OECD, we have seen these new themes emerge.[1] Historically, the US had been by far the world's largest oil producer, and the world oil market had been dominated by a small number of giant multinational (mostly-American) oil companies (the so-called ""Seven Sisters of oil"": Standard Oil of New Jersey, alias Exxon (US); Standard Oil of New York, alias Mobil (US/UK); Standard Oil of California, alias Chevron (US), Gulf Oil, now part of Chevron (US); Texaco, now part of Chevron (US); Anglo-Persian Oil Company, alias BP (UK); and Royal Dutch Shell, alias Shell (UK/Netherlands).[5]: 9  During the late 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s, and the early 1970s, the discovery and development of many giant oil and gas fields outside the US by those and other companies kept the world flooded with cheap oil. Meanwhile, global demand increased to take advantage of the increased global supply at lower prices. In particular, US oil consumption increased faster than production, and the country, which had been a net oil exporter, became a major oil importer. In 1970, US oil production unexpectedly peaked and started to decline, which caused global oil markets to tighten rapidly as the US started to import more and more Arab oil.[5]: 10  As the decade continued, global demand caught up with global supply, and two major oil price shocks occurred: the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 oil crisis.[6] The first occurred after the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), whose membership is the Arab members of the similarly named Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia, imposed an embargo on oil exports to the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Japan, and Canada in retaliation for supporting for Israel during the Yom Kippur War. US producers had been able to defeat the 1967 oil embargo by ramping up domestic production and flooding the world market with additional product at cut-rate prices, but declining domestic production and the ongoing rise in global demand prevented a similar response to the 1973 Arab embargo. The result was immediate shortages and lineups for gasoline in importing countries, particularly the US, which signalled the end of decades of cheap oil and a change in the balance of power from consuming countries, which now included the United States, to producing countries.[7] On October 16, 1973, the Ministerial Committee of the Persian Gulf's OPEC membership announced an immediate rise in its posted price from $2.18 to $5.12 per barrel of oil.[5]: 10  ""Thus for the first time in oil history, the producing countries assumed power to consider and set the oil price unilaterally, and independently of the"" Seven Sisters.[5]: 10 The Yom Kippur War ended in October, but the price of oil continued to increase, and by January 1974, it had quadrupled to US$12 a barrel. ""The more than seven-fold increase in the oil price from $1.80/b in 1970 to $13.54/b in 1978 created profound and far-reaching changes in the world oil balance, as well as the prevailing relationships among major oil producers, principal oil importers, and the major oil companies... [and the] spectacular jump of the crude spot price to more than $US40/b following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, turned the global oil market into total disarray.""[5]: 10  The Norwegian economics historian Ola Honningdal Grytten described that period in the 1970s as one of a prolonged global recession and slow growth that affected most developed economies.[6] The 1979 oil crisis, precipitated by the Iranian Revolution and compounded by the Iran–Iraq War, was the second major market disturbance in the 1970s. ""The curtailment of oil supplies and the skyrocketing of oil prices had far-reaching effects on producers, consumers, and the oil industry itself.""[attribution needed][8] In his State of the Union Address in January 1980, US President Jimmy Carter described how his country's ""excessive dependence on foreign oil is a clear and present danger,""[9] and he called for a ""clear, comprehensive energy policy for the United States.""[9] The Canadian petroleum industry arose in parallel with that of the US. The first oil well in North America was dug in Ontario in 1848 by using picks and shovels, one year before the first oil well in the United States had been drilled in Pennsylvania.[10] By 1870, Canada had 100 oil refineries in operation and was exporting oil to Europe.[11] However, the oil fields of Ontario were shallow and small, and oil production started to decline around 1900 while the automobile started to become popular. In contrast, US oil production grew rapidly after huge discoveries had been made in Texas, Oklahoma, California, and elsewhere. By the end of World War II, Canada imported 90% of its oil, mostly from the US. The situation changed dramatically in 1947, when Imperial Oil drilled a well near Leduc, Alberta, to see what was causing peculiar anomalies on its newly introduced reflection seismology surveys. The peculiar anomalies turned out to be oil fields, and Leduc No. 1 was the discovery well for the first of many large oil fields. As a consequence of the large finds, cheap and plentiful Alberta oil produced a huge surplus of oil on the Canadian Prairies, which had no immediate market since the major oil markets were in Ontario and Quebec. In 1949, Imperial Oil applied to the federal government to build the Interprovincial Pipeline (IPL) to Lake Superior, which allowed it to supply the Midwestern United States. By 1956, the pipeline had been extended via Sarnia, Ontario, to Toronto; at 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi), it became the longest oil pipeline in the world. The federal government gave approval to build a pipeline in Western Canada, and in 1953, the 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) Transmountain Pipeline was built from Edmonton to Vancouver, British Columbia, with an extension to northwest Washington. The pipelines did more to improve the energy security of the United States than that of Canada since the Canadian government was more interested in Canada's trade balance than in military or energy security. The Canadian government assumed that Eastern Canada could always import enough oil to meet its needs and that imported oil would always be cheaper than domestic oil. The National Energy Board (NEB) was created in 1959 ""to monitor and report on all federal matters of energy as well as regulate pipelines, energy imports and exports and utility rates and tariffs.""[12] The NEB regulated mostly the construction and the operation of oil and natural gas pipelines crossing provincial or international borders. The Board approved pipeline traffic, tolls, and tariffs under the authority of the National Energy Board Act.[13] From its introduction in 1961 to its end in September 1973, the National Oil Policy (NOP) was the cornerstone of Canadian energy policy. It ""established a protected market for domestic oil west of the Ottawa Valley, which freed the industry from foreign competition,""[attribution needed] and the five eastern provinces, which included major refineries in Ontario and Quebec, continued to rely on foreign imports of crude oil, such as from Venezuela.[12] In 1973, ""the federal government announced the extension of the inter-provincial oil pipeline to Montreal (completed in 1976), froze prices of domestic crude and certain oil products, and sought to control export prices. The federal government announced this change in policy so that supply problems in the United States would not automatically raise prices for Canadian consumers.""[attribution needed][12] After the first OPEC price shock in 1973, the federal government ""formally broke the link between domestic prices and international prices. The objective of 'made-in-Canada' prices for crude oil was to protect Canadians across the country from the whims of the world oil market and to provide producers with enough incentives to develop new energy resources.""[attribution needed][12] In 1981, the Edmonton economist Brian Scarfe claimed that the NEB's setting of the price of oil and natural gas in Canada meant that producers did not receive full world prices for the resource and that consumers were not charged world prices.[14]: 2–5  He claimed that the subsidies had a number of side effects, including larger trade deficits, larger federal budget deficits, higher real interest rates, and higher inflation.[14]: 2–5 [15][16] In 1975, in response to the world energy crisis, the federal government created Petro-Canada, a Canadian crown corporation that was national oil company. Petro-Canada was involved in the massive Hibernia oil find off Newfoundland and was a partner in the Syncrude oil sands venture in Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Alberta oil industry was then overwhelmingly owned by Americans, who were also the major importer of Albertan oil. The Petro-Canada Centre (1975–2009) was known in the oil patch as ""Red Square"" until its purchase by Suncor.[17] The NEP included plans for a ""greatly-expanded Petro-Canada.""[attribution needed][18] In 1974, Canada inaugurated its first system for pricing oil with three objectives: to regulate prices of domestic crude oil by federal-provincial agreements, to subsidize imported oil so that consumers in Eastern Canada would enjoy lower prices, and to control prices and quantities of crude oil and products in the exporting market. Synthetic crude oil (upgraded petroleum from oil sands) was exempted from the policy and was sold at the world price. The federal government levied a tax on all oil refined in Canada to pay for the difference between the price of synthetic and that of conventional crude oil.[12] The federal budget in October 1980 reflected the concern that Canada could ""become increasingly dependent on insecure foreign supplies and, therefore, unnecessarily subject to the vagaries of the world oil market.""[1] On 28 October 1980, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen introduced the National Energy Program but cautioned that things could get worse if there were ""new shocks coming from the price of oil or food or if the upward momentum of costs and prices proves impervious to the economic climate I am seeking to create.""[1] ""The new energy policy limits the rise in prices of oil and gas to domestic consumers and thus continues to protect us from the violent shocks of OPEC price increases. It strengthens our specific measures to promote the most economical use of energy and in particular the displacement of oil by other fuels. It provides new impetus to the development of new sources of supply, through direct government programs and through new incentives of particular value to Canadian-owned producers. Energy policy is only the most urgent element of our new strategy. Renewed growth in productivity and lower costs are needed throughout the economy. Within the overall expenditure plan which I will lay before the House, we have assigned clear priority to economic development."" The NEP's goals were ""security of supply and ultimate independence from the world oil market; opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry; particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion; and fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.""[1] The NEP had three main objectives: increase ownership of the oil industry by Canadians; price energy fairly for Canadian consumers; and provide Canadian energy self-sufficiency. The NEP was also designed to promote lower prices with price controls; promote exploration for oil in Canada; promote alternative energy sources; and increase federal government revenues from oil sales through a variety of taxes and revenue-sharing agreements.[19] The NEP's Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) instituted a double-taxation mechanism that did not apply to other commodities, such as gold and copper (see ""Program details"" item (c), below), ""to redistribute revenue from the [oil] industry and lessen the cost of oil for Eastern Canada"" in an attempt to insulate the Canadian economy from the shock of rising global oil prices[20] (see ""Program details"" item (a), below). In 1981, Scarfe argued that by keeping domestic oil prices below world market prices, the NEP was essentially mandating provincial generosity and subsidizing all Canadian consumers of fuel, because of Alberta and the other oil-producing provinces (such as Newfoundland, which received funding by the NEP for the Hibernia project).[14]: 8 However, Marc Lalonde, the Minister of Energy Mines and Resources whose department oversaw development of the NEP would later say in 1986: ""The major factor behind the NEP wasn't Canadianization or getting more from the industry or even self sufficiency,"" [...] ""The determinant factor was the fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the federal government [...] ""Our proposal was to increase Ottawa's share appreciably, so that the share of the producing provinces would decline significantly and the industry's share would decline somewhat.""[21] The NEP ""had three principles: (1) security of supply and ultimate independence from the world market, (2) opportunity for all Canadians to participate in the energy industry, particularly oil and gas, and to share in the benefits of its expansion, and (3) fairness, with a pricing and revenue-sharing regime which recognizes the needs and rights of all Canadians.""[1]: 6 [14]: 5–7 ""The main elements of the program included: (a) a blended or 'made-in-Canada' price of oil, an average of the costs of imported and domestic oil, which will rise gradually and predictably but will remain well below world prices and will never be more than 85 per cent of the lower of the price of imported oil or of oil in the US, and which will be financed by a Petroleum Compensation Charge levied on refiners...; (b) natural gas prices which will increase less quickly than oil prices, but which will include a new and rising federal tax on all natural gas and gas liquids; (c) a petroleum and gas revenue tax of 8 per cent applied to net operating revenues before royalty and other expense deductions on all production of oil and natural gas in Canada...; (d) the phasing out of the depletion allowances for oil and gas exploration and development, which will be replaced with a new system of direct incentive payments, structured to encourage investment by Canadian companies, with added incentives for exploration on Canada Lands (lands which the federal government held the mineral rights as opposed to private lands and lands which provinces held the mineral rights); (e) a federal share of petroleum production income at the wellhead which will rise from about 10 per cent in recent years to 24 per cent over the 1980-83 period, with the share of the producing provinces falling from 45 to 43 per cent and that of the industry falling from 45 to 33 per cent over the same period; (f) added incentives for energy conservation and energy conversion away from oil, particularly applicable to Eastern Canada, including the extension of the natural gas pipe-line system to Quebec City and the maritimes, with the additional transport charges being passed back to the producer; and (g) a Canadian ownership levy to assist in financing the acquisition of the Canadian operations of one or more multinational oil companies, with the objective of achieving at least 50 per cent Canadian ownership of oil and gas production by 1990, Canadian control of a significant number of the major oil and gas corporations, and an early increase in the share of the oil and gas sector owned by the Government of Canada.""[14]: 6 While the program increased domestic price controls, the emphasis on revenue sharing and incentives for oil exploration on federally owned lands was viewed critically by Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed.[22] Lougheed fought the program vigorously in the courts and in public, where he actively stoked Alberta nationalism in a television address claiming the program would bring more ""Ottawa"" to the province. Prior to the announcement of the National Energy Program, Lougheed had threatened to reduce Alberta's production of oil and gas to counter any federal program to increase taxes. If Alberta reduced production, Central Canada refineries and other businesses would need to purchase foreign oil which would be heavily subsidized by the federal government, a cost that it could not afford to with a $13.7 billion deficit in 1980.[23] Lougheed finally decided to exercise this authority to force Trudeau to concede some measures of the Program, and Lougheed announced on television a 60,000 barrel reduction to Alberta's production of crude oil to take place over nine months beginning in April 1981, and the suspension of two oil sands projects.[22][24][25] Lougheed however pledged that he would not allow a national oil shortage to occur, and would suspend the cuts if a shortage occurred.[24] The threat was successful as Trudeau and Lougheed signed ""an oil and gas prices and revenue sharing"" agreement in 1981: ""The agreement sets a series of price increases for old oil starting with a $2.50 a barrel increase on October 1, 1981 and ""generous"" near world prices for new oil, effective January 1, 1982, which will see an estimated wellhead price of $49.22 per barrel by July 1, 1982. New oil is defined as oil from pools initially discovered after December 31, 1980. It includes new conventional oil found in Alberta, synthetic oil, including existing production from the SUNCOR and SYNCRUDE plants, and new oil from Canada lands.... At their press conference Tuesday, the leaders of both parties estimated the deal is worth an approximate $212.8 billion in revenues to Ottawa, Alberta and the petroleum industry over the next five years. An estimate of the revenue share compared to the NEP proposal indicated the federal government will receive $14 billion more than in the NEP schedule, the industry will receive $10 billion more and Alberta will receive $8 billion more. According to Lalonde, in percentage terms compared to the NEP, Ottawa's share will rise from 24% to 29%, Alberta's share will rise to 34% from 33%, and industry's share will drop from 43% to 33% over the life of the agreement. Lougheed said because of the pact industry will receive about 25% more cash flow due to the two-tier new and old pricing scheme, which represents an improvement in cash flow of at least $2 billion for each year of the agreement."" Lougheed's success in the agreement was marked by a widely published photograph of a celebratory champagne toast with Trudeau and himself.[22] Lougheed later admitted to regretting the toast.[27] Lougheed's battle with the National Energy Program corresponded with the 1980s oil glut where energy prices dropped dramatically due to falling demand. Lougheed was forced to lower royalty rates through the Oil and Gas Activity Program and focused the government's efforts on natural gas diversification to stem falling revenues and a declining economy.[28] Helliwell et al. (1983) reported that the early 1980s energy price declines prompted the federal and provincial governments to update their revenue-sharing agreements.[29]: 284  The amended agreements allowed for $4.2 billion in higher revenues ($1.7 billion for the federal government and $1.2 billion each for the provincial governments and industry),[29]: 290  which was 30% of the increase that would have been gained from going to world prices.[29]: 290  According to Helliwell et al., the NEP made did not in fact cause industry to be significantly exposed to the declining global oil prices, but the largest part of direct revenue losses accrued to governments.[29]: 294  Thus, industry operated throughout the period of the NEP under relatively-similar oil prices, the ""made-in-Canada"" oil price (see item (a) in National Energy Program Details, above). In 1981, the Edmonton economist Scarfe argued that the greatest impact of the NEP was its failure to deliver the revenues that had been originally forecast in the 1980 federal budget. Introduced by Finance Minister Allan MacEachen, it projected a reduction of federal deficits from $14.2 billion in 1980 to $11.8 billion in fiscal 1984, primarily from substantial increases in revenues from the oil and gas sector, and the maintenance of expenditures.[14]: 10  Scarfe speculated that the NEP would discourage large-scale oil investment projects and thus reduce these projected revenues.[14]: 10  Federal deficits had been expected to decrease, primarily by substantial increases in revenues from oil and gas.[14]: 10  Instead, by 1983, the Ministry of Finance had concluded that the federal government had established a structural deficit[30] of $29.7 billion, an increase from 3.5% of GNP in 1980 to 6.2% of GNP in 1983.[31]: 64 Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50 billion and $100 billion because of the NEP.[32][33] Alberta still initially enjoyed an economic surplus due to high oil prices, but the surplus was heavily reduced by the NEP, which, in turn, stymied many of Lougheed's policies for economic diversification to reduce Alberta's dependence on the cyclical energy industry, such as the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, and also left the province with an infrastructure deficit. In particular, the Alberta Heritage Fund was meant to save as much of the earnings during high oil prices to act as a ""rainy day"" cushion if oil prices collapsed because of the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry. The NEP was one reason that the fund failed to grow to its full potential.[34] In 2022, the Heritage Savings Trust Fund has $19B, a moderate increase on the $13B it had in 1986. This slow growth occurred despite some years when Alberta government had multi-billion-dollar surpluses.[35][36] Alberta's GDP was between $60 billion and $80 billion annually during the years of the NEP (1980-1986). It is unclear whether the estimates took into account the decline in world crude oil prices that began only a few months after the NEP had come into force, the graph of long-term oil prices shows that prices adjusted for inflation did not drop below pre-1980s levels until 1985. Since the program was cancelled in 1986, the NEP was active for five years with among the most expensive for oil prices on record, and the NEP prevented Alberta's economy from fully realising those prices.[26] In inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars, the year the NEP took effect (1980) per capita had fiscal contributions by Alberta to the federal government increase 77% over 1979 levels from $6,578 in 1979 to $11,641 in 1980.[37]: 11  In the five years prior to the NEP (1975–1979), the per capita contributions by Alberta had approximated the fluctuations in the price of oil (see graph Fluctuations: Oil Prices & Alberta Per Capita Federal Contributions 1975–1981). In 1980, however, the inflation-adjusted average price of oil was only 5% higher than the previous year, but the per capita contributions from Alberta rose 77%[37] (see graph Fluctuations: Oil Prices & Alberta Per Capita Federal Contributions 1975–1981). Again in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars, the year the NEP was terminated (1986) had per capita contributions to the federal government by Alberta collapse to $680, a mere 10% of 1979 levels.[37] During the NEP years (1980–1985), only one other province was a net contributor per capita to the federal government: Saskatchewan, which also produces oil. In 1980 and 1981, Saskatchewan was a net per capita contributor to the federal government with a peak in 1981 at only $514, compared to Alberta's peak of $12,735 the same year, both values being 2004 inflation-adjusted dollars.[37] Thus, during the NEP (1980 to 1985), Alberta was the sole overall net contributor to the federal government, and all other provinces enjoyed being net recipients.[37] In 1982, during the severe global recession, there were over 30,000 consumer bankruptcies in Canada, a 33% increase over the previous year. The bankruptcy rate began to fall from 1983 to 1985, as the economy strengthened.[38]: 23  From 1980 to 1985, bankruptcies per 1,000 businesses in Canada peaked at 50% above the 1980 rate.[39]: 20  Meanwhile, the bankruptcy rate in Alberta rose by 150% after the NEP took effect.[34][40]: 12 Since bankruptcies[39] and real estate prices[41] did not fare as negatively in Central Canada as in the rest of Canada and in the United States,[42] the NEP might have had a positive effect in Central Canada. The unemployment rate in Alberta rose from 3.7 percent in September 1980 to 12.4 percent in 1984 following passage of the NEP.[43][44] Throughout the 1950s, the 1960s, and the 1970s, the retail price of petroleum in Canada consistently remained close to the price of gasoline in the United States and was often lower than prices seen in the US, especially during the 1970s price spikes. The NEP, which raised the price of fuel in the West and coincided with a hike in provincial gas taxes in Ontario and Quebec,[45] made the retail price of gasoline in Canada become noticeably higher than that of the US, a trend that has continued ever since. The rationale for the program weakened when world oil prices began a slow decline in the early 1980s and collapsed in late 1985 (see figure above, ""Long-Term Oil Prices, 1861–2007""). A phased shutdown was commenced by Jean Chrétien, then Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources. In the 1984 election, the Progressive Conservative Party of Brian Mulroney was elected to a majority in the House of Commons with the support of Western Canada after he had campaigned against the NEP. However, Mulroney did not eliminate the last vestiges of the program until two-and-a half years later, when world oil prices had dropped below pre-1980s levels (as adjusted for inflation: see Long-Term Oil Prices, 1861–2007). On June 1, 1985, after extensive discussions between the federal Government and the governments of the oil-producing provinces, the ""Western Accord on Energy"" was agreed.[dead link][46] It provided for the full deregulation of oil prices and for allowing the market forces of international and local supply and demand determine prices.[46] Included in the full deregulation of domestic oil prices, the Western Accord also ""abolished import subsidies, the export tax on crude and oil products, and the petroleum compensation charge. It also phased out PIP grants and the PGRT. In addition, controls were lifted on oil exports.""[47]: 12–15 [12] The NEP was extremely unpopular in Western Canada, especially in Alberta, where most of Canada's oil is produced. With natural resources falling constitutionally within the domain of provincial jurisdictions, many Albertans viewed the NEP as a detrimental intrusion by the federal government into the province's affairs.[48] Edmonton economist Scarfe argued that for people in Western Canada, especially Alberta, the NEP was perceived to be at their expense in benefiting the eastern provinces.[14] Particularly vilified was Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, whose Liberals had no seat west of Manitoba. Ed Clark, a senior bureaucrat in the Trudeau Liberal government, helped to develop the National Energy Program and earned himself the moniker ""Red Ed"" in the Alberta oil industry. Shortly after Brian Mulroney had taken office, Clark was fired.[49] Petro-Canada, established in 1975, was responsible for implementing much of the Program. Petro-Canada was given the backronym ""Pierre Elliott Trudeau Rips Off Canada"" by opponents of the National Energy Program. According to Mary Elizabeth Vicente, an Edmonton librarian who wrote an article on the National Energy Program in 2005, the popular western slogan during the NEP, appearing on many bumper stickers, was ""Let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark.""[50] Other bumpers stated ""I'd rather push this thing a mile than buy gas from PetroCan.""[51] McKenzie argued in 1981 that politically, the NEP heightened distrust of the federal government in Western Canada, especially in Alberta, where many believed the NEP to be an intrusion of the federal government into an area of provincial jurisdiction.[48] According to a National Post journalist,[34] ""The anger and alienation of this era would provide much of the fuel behind the rise of Reform and Canadian Alliance parties, becoming the Conservative party that rules Ottawa today. The anger and alienation of Albertans also led Mr. Lougheed to oppose many of Mr. Trudeau’s proposed plans for the Constitution Act of 1982; he argued against granting Ontario and Quebec veto powers, fought for provincial resource rights and insisted on the notwithstanding clause.

,,Trudeau government won’t rule out using force to build Kinder Morgan’s pipeline,"   “The natural resources minister threatened to use the army on British Columbians.” With Justin Trudeau promising the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will go ahead despite fierce opposition from Indigenous land protectors will he authorize the use of force to do so? That’s a question Nation to Nation put to the political panel Thursday. Trudeau is now pledging to help finance the project and pass new legislation to ensure the pipeline gets in the ground from Edmonton to Burnaby, B.C. Host Todd Lamirande put the question to each panelist, does that mean calling in the police or army? “I think we all expect people to abide by the rule of law,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, parliamentary secretary to the minister of environment and climate change. Wilkinson wouldn’t commit to what government will do to deal with land protectors who have said they refuse to let this pipeline be built. Tensions are expected to only rise as construction is supposed to ramp up this summer. There has already been over 140 people charged with breaking a court order to not block the gates of Kinder Morgan in Burnaby. Kinder Morgan said 43 First Nations and Indigenous groups have signed deals with the company, but a number of others have not, including Coldwater, B.C. The number of deals were up to 51 but Kinder Morgan said earlier this week eight First Nations didn’t ratify an agreement last year. Many fear irreparable environmental damage from oil spills and extracting more fossil fuels from Alberta’s oil sands. The Liberal government has pledged $1.5 billion to protect the country’s oceans from the project’s resulting increase in oil tankers along the west coast. “Lawful protests is certainly part of Canada’s democratic process and the rule of law needs to be respected,” said Cathy McLeod, the Conservative shadow minister for Indigenous and Northern Affairs. One of those arrested and facing charges is Burnaby South NDP MP Kennedy Stewart who reminded the panel that Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has already vowed once to use force. Carr told a group of business people in Edmonton Dec. 1, 2016, just days after the government approved the project, that the army or police could be used to deal with so-called unlawful protests. Carr apologized afterward saying he misspoke. However, Stewart said Carr’s comments changed things for him. “When the natural resources minister threatened to use the army on British Columbians then I realized this hit a different place,” said Stewart. “When you threaten to use the defence forces to push a project through against the will of communities, violating a constitution, ignoring consent then I think it takes the debate to a whole other level.” Stewart tried to get Carr to confirm a few weeks ago in the House of Commons that the government wouldn’t use police or the army against land protectors. “Will he stand in the House today and say that he will never do this, that it would never be considered, that he would not use the army and the police forces against British Columbians in their own communities, on the reserves, and in their municipalities?” said Stewart on Feb. 12. Carr repeated he misspoke but didn’t say the government wouldn’t use force. “Within a few days of having said it, I realized it would invoke images that were not healthy to the debate, and I apologized to Indigenous leaders,” Carr replied. “I will say again, as I have said many times over many months, that I apologized and misspoke.” Watch the full episode of Nation to Nation below:   Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee is studying Bill C-69 that promises to revamp the environmental assessment and regulatory process on resource extraction projects. But it has sometimes been seen as a battle between jobs and the environment. Conservative MP Robert Sopuck called the process “toxic” at the committee Wednesday. But also there was Bill Namagoose, the executive director of the Grand Council of the Crees to give advice from their perspective. Namagoose said they are not opposed to development as long as their rights are respected. That means being part of it the decision-making process in their territory. “We’re not observers, we’re not intervenors, we’re participants and that’s a treaty right we would like protected and recognized by this new legislation,” he said. However, they are still trying to negotiate with the federal government to see that happen. As for the committee hearing, Namagoose said he didn’t think the Liberals were interested in hearing much from the Grand Council of the Crees. “I noticed the MPs didn’t ask me any questions or ask me to comment,” he said. He said he tried to comment on some issues during the hearing but his microphone was turned off. “The Liberal party seems to have this in control. They don’t want any Cree participation or that seems to be the objective and was clearly decided for the hearing that we would just read our statement and be ignored after,” he said. Nation to Nation is traveling to British Columbia next week to dig more into the issues surrounding the Trans Mountain pipeline on both sides of the argument.

David Schindler, professor emeritus of ecology at the University of Alberta, says he thinks B.C.’s concerns about the Trans Mountain pipeline are legitimate.
“Somehow, science is being ignored in all this, I think the questions [about spills] are very legitimate.”
“We still don’t know how to get bitumen out from under the ice,” he said. “If it goes in to one of the major salmon rivers crossing B.C., we will just sit by and helplessly watch it go downstream.”
Also, in regard to Climate Change commitments, Schindler says, there is a lack of commitment to promises made during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris.
“From what I see, we are not taking this commitment very seriously at all,” he said. “We are taking a very ‘head in the sand’ approach to the problem.” taking lessons from little donny drumpf is he?

The Kock brothers are behind this as in most deals out of Texas. Russia seems to have a hand in this deal as well. You can be shure Dump has his tiny hands out. All these Dick-Traitors are trying to suck the earth dry of what is left to fill their pockets. The world is being run by evil greedy billionaires and wannabes.
These oil sands have already been assessed as dangerous and will pollute your environment.
These same people are pushing pipelines down every state and community throats in the U.S.
All the big boys have investments into what’s left of oil.
Dump stopped the progress in clean energy. Its always greed. Its always about oil.
We are killing each other to please the few elite over oil.
No such thing as peaceful war over oil. Start protecting yourselves because all these governments are out for themselves. They do not care whom they hurt or kill to get what they want.

Good luck in protecting each other. Its so sad life has come down to evil taking over. I’m confused to why liberals are considered republicans in Canada. Opposite to the USA.
The Kock brothers are behind this as in most deals out of Texas. Russia seems to have a hand in this deal as well. You can be shure Dump has his tiny hands out. All these Dick-Traitors are trying to suck the earth dry of what is left to fill their pockets. The world is being run by evil greedy billionaires and wannabes.
These oil sands have already been assessed as dangerous and will pollute your environment.
These same people are pushing pipelines down every state and community throats in the U.S.
All the big boys have investments into what’s left of oil.
Dump stopped the progress in clean energy. Its always greed. Its always about oil.
We are killing each other to please the few elite over oil.
No such thing as peaceful war over oil. Start protecting yourselves because all these governments are out for themselves. They do not care whom they hurt or kill to get what they want.
It seems no place is safe to live honestly anymore.
Good luck in protecting each other. Its so sad life has come down to evil taking over. How about Alberta refine the Bitumen prior to shipping. The issue is clean up.

Even Kinder-Morgan knows that there is no market for bitumen at the west coast tidewater. There is no need for additional bitumen transport capacity given that Keystone XL is going ahead.

The suggestion that the use of force would be sanctioned is infuriating.

I have been concerned for some time that the aggressive and threatening rhetoric from both Trudeau and Notley would lead to sabotage and violence. The idea of using force against protesters will escalate the conflict.
If the Trudeau government sent in the army to attack protesters; I, for one, would consider this to be an act of war against British Columbians. Since when would the government of Canada start a civil war to prop up a Texas pipeline company of questionable ethics so they can build an unneeded pipeline for a product with a rapidly diminishing market.

He finds money from our tax dollars to bail out a failing, foreign company from Texas, but he does not find money for our veterans, for badly needed housing, for improving education, for investing in clean energy which would help to protect our environment .
Perhaps he learned as a child from his father to say: “F..k you!” Historically speaking, it is definitely NOT the case that people will abide by the rule of law, especially when it runs contrary to common sense, decency and fairness. That Trudeau expects compliance and passivity from Canadians as he pushes a dated, unfair, potentially catastrophic agenda, is not disturbing…its his threat to use force against his own people, that is most fucked…and then to stand at podiums around the world spreading his dainty parlance …just makes my blood boil.

,,Justin Trudeau Says Trans Mountain Investment Remains Solid,"   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday he was confident the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion was a solid investment and that interest is high among Indigenous groups who want to buy a share of the pipeline. The Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) is expected to nearly triple the flow of crude from Alberta’s oil sands to Burnaby, British Columbia, and is intended to unlock Asian markets for Canadian oil, which is now mostly exported to the United States. The Canadian government bought the pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2018 to make sure the project was completed after it ran into challenges, including opposition from Indigenous peoples and environmentalists. Now that it is nearing completion, the government has approached Indigenous groups looking at buying a portion of the pipeline. “I am very excited and interested that there are so many Indigenous groups interested in purchasing the TMX pipeline. We’re engaged in conversations with them right now,” Trudeau told reporters in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. “We are confident that the business case for the Trans Mountain pipeline remains solid,” Trudeau said, when asked whether the government would have to sell the pipeline for less than it cost to build it. The government has not said how much the pipeline would sell for, nor has it fixed a deadline for the sale. The project has been beset with construction delays and cost overruns, and is now expected to cost nearly C$31 billion, more than quadrupling the C$7.4 billion budgeted in 2017. The government does not want to be the long-term owner of the project, which is due to start shipping in the first quarter of 2024.

,,"Petro-Canada sells Alberta, B.C. properties","This article was published more than 23 years ago. Some information may no longer be current. Petro-Canada said Monday that it has signed deals to sell seven properties in British Columbia and Alberta to a host of buyers for $270-million in a streamlining of its portfolio of natural-gas assets. Anderson Exploration Ltd. of Calgary and Tulsa, Okla.-based Samson Investment Co. were among the buyers of the properties, which produce a total of about 55 million cubic feet of natural gas a day. Despite the sales, Petro-Canada, the country's No. 3 integrated oil company, still considers natural gas operations in western Canada to be one of its top businesses. Natural-gas prices are currently at record levels. ""This sale is consistent with Petro-Canada's stated intent to divest select properties in western Canada that do not align with the corporation's strategy,"" vice-president Norm McIntyre said in a statement. As part of a company-wide spending budget of $1.4-billion for 2001, $380-million is earmarked for exploration and production in the region. In the first nine months of 2000, Petro-Canada's gas output in western Canada averaged 730 million cubic feet a day, making it one of the biggest producers. In northeastern British Columbia, Storm Energy Inc. bought the 9-million-cubic-feet-a-day (mmcfd) Tommy Lakes property and Anderson bought the 1.5-mmcfd Bubbles property. Samson purchased Petro-Canada's Fort St. John, Buick and Fireweed assets, which pump out 5.5, 4.8 and 3.8 mmcfd respectively. It first announced it made the deals in November. In Alberta, Paramount Resources Ltd. bought the 13.7 mmcfd Kaybob property, and Ionic Energy Inc. and Richland Petroleum Corp. teamed up to buy the 15.1 mmcfd Whitecourt assets. The B.C. sales were slated to close before the end of the year and the Alberta sales by February, Petro-Canada said. An informative summary of the day’s top business headlines, features and columns.

,,Trudeau government will buy Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline system,"STRAIGHT TALK  The federal government looks like it's back in the fossil-fuel business. More than a decade after one Liberal regime sold its stake in Petro-Canada, another Liberal regime plans to spend $4.5 billion to buy Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline system, including its expansion project. At a news conference this morning, Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr revealed the details. He said the cabinet has given the green light to buy the pipeline, but it still requires the approval of Kinder Morgan's shareholders. The deal is scheduled to close in August. If this occurs, the pipeline would be put under a Crown corporation. ""This transaction represents a sound investment opportunity,"" Morneau claimed. If the federal government becomes the owner, it's also on the hook for the cost of completing the project. The finance minister maintained that this agreement will enable Kinder Morgan to continue construction through the spring and summer months. The Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project is estimated to cost $7.4 billion. However, an article in last weekend's Globe and Mail indicated that the price tag will go even higher, according to unnamed federal government sources.  The federal government plans to sell the pipeline in the future, with Morneau claiming that this will provide a ""real return on investment for the benefit of British Columbians, Albertans, and Canadians"". ""Canadian investors have expressed interest, including Indigenous groups, pension funds, and others,"" the finance minister said.  Back in 2004, the federal government sold its 19 percent stake in Petro-Canada for $3.2 billion, but after the costs of the offering and other expenses were deducted, it ended up with about $2.6 billion in the treasury. In 2016, UBC geography professor and climate-change researcher Simon Donner wrote an article in Policy Options about the impact of the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion on greenhouse gas emissions and Canada's commitment under the Paris Agreement. The project will triple diluted bitumen shipments from Alberta to B.C. to 890,000 barrels per day. ""The level of emissions will depend largely on the effect of additional pipeline capacity on upstream oil operations,"" Donner wrote. ""If the new pipeline capacity is filled only by the volume of bitumen currently transported by rail, oil-sands emissions will not increase but will become 'locked' at near today’s level of 62 Mt [one million metric tonnes] CO2e per year throughout the operational lifetime of the pipeline."" However, his Policy Options article reported that if the pipeline transported diluted bitumen created through new production, that would add 13 to 15 Mt per year, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada. Under the Paris Agreement, signatories, including Canada, have agreed to keep the global average temperature increase to  2 °C  above the average before the Industrial Revolution began. Even if Canada were to be allocated two percent of the global carbon pie—and that would be generous, given our population—the Trans Mountain pipeline project could consume 11 to 13 percent of our allotment in the future, according to Donner. ""The fraction increases to 12-15% if upstream emissions from the recently approved LNG facility are added, and 13-17% with the just-approved replacement of the Enbridge line 3 pipeline,"" he added.  ""Even this 'generous' scenario would place a heavy, possibly unrealistic, burden on the rest of the economy to reduce emissions,"" Donner continued in his Policy Options article. ""With oil-sands and LNG emissions as high as or higher than they are today, emissions from all other sectors would need to decrease by 35-38% below today’s levels in order for Canada to stay below the 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels. ""The change would need to be even more dramatic if the Keystone XL pipeline is also constructed, as may be the wish of President Elect Donald Trump."" If Canada were to receive 0.5 percent of the world's carbon pie, based on our population, Donner concluded that the Trans Mountain pipeline would gobble up 40 percent to 49 percent of our allotment. ""If we are serious about our commitment to fighting climate change, we need to talk not about new pipeline capacity, but about managing the long-term decline of oil-sands emissions over the next few decades,"" Donner concluded. ""Otherwise, we’ll blow our budget."" Trudeau, Morneau, and Carr repeatedly say that the Kinder Morgan pipeline project is in the ""national interest"". It's become a federal Liberal mantra. The obvious question, however, is whether the Trudeau cabinet has decided that the Paris Agreement is not in the national interest—judging from its decision today to buy a pipeline.

,,Petro-Can leaves Venezuela," Petro-Canada has decided to pull out of Venezuela and has reached an agreement with the state oil company on compensation for its oil investments, the Venezuelan government said.   CARACAS–Petro-Canada has decided to pull out of Venezuela and has reached an agreement with the state oil company on compensation for its oil investments, the Venezuelan government said. Calgary-based Petro-Canada had partnered with Exxon Mobil Corp., which is also withdrawing from Venezuela, in developing the La Ceiba block near western Lake Maracaibo. The block has not yet begun producing oil.  President Hugo Chavez's government has required all private companies to accept minority stakes in oil production projects and join state-controlled joint ventures. Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez told a news conference that state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, was unable to reach an agreement with Petro-Canada. ""Petro-Canada has decided on the culmination of its participation in its businesses in the country and compensation has been agreed upon between the companies that has already been accepted by both parties,"" Ramirez said.

,,Canada unveils multibillion-dollar plan to cut carbon emissions,"Environmentalists welcome emissions reduction plan, but say it will be vital to ‘hold politicians’ feet to the fire’. Save articles to read later and create your own reading list. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has unveiled a $7.3bn (9.1 billion Canadian dollars) plan to help the country meet its carbon emissions target, including significant reductions in the oil-and-gas sector. Speaking in Vancouver on Tuesday, Trudeau linked Europe’s effort to move away from Russian oil and natural gas after the country’s invasion of Ukraine to a broader, global push towards renewable energy. “The leaders I spoke with in Europe over the past few weeks were clear: They don’t just want to end their dependence on Russian oil and gas, they want to accelerate the energy transformation to clean and green power,” Trudeau told reporters. “The whole world is focusing on clean energy,” he said, “and Canada cannot afford not to do that.” The plan announced on Tuesday includes a $2.3bn (2.9 billion Canadian dollars) investment in zero-emission vehicles and related infrastructure, as well as $800m (one billion Canadian dollars) to “green” Canadian homes and buildings. The government also says it will work closely with provinces and territories to develop an approach to cap oil-and-gas sector emissions to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and reduce oil-and-gas methane emissions by at least 75 percent by 2030. Trudeau has been hailed as a climate leader internationally, pledging to cut Canada’s emissions and invest in cleaner energy. But his Liberal government has been slammed for backing the expansion of oil pipelines and other energy projects that critics have said would worsen the climate crisis. Last year, the Liberals set a new target of slashing carbon emissions by 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But an independent parliamentary watchdog concluded that Ottawa had not done enough to reach that goal, after poring over decades of government climate actions that yielded an increase in emissions. Environment Commissioner Jerry DeMarco said in November that Canada was ranked the “worst performer” among the G7 industrialised nations in cutting emissions. While Canada represents about 1.6 percent of global CO2 emissions, it is among the top 10 largest emitters globally and one of the highest emitters per capita. Trudeau’s new emissions reduction plan comes just days after his government last week announced it would raise oil and gas exports this year by up to 300,000 barrels per day – an increase of about 5 percent. The move, Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said last Thursday, aimed to help Canada’s allies respond to “an energy security crisis” caused by Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine. Canada, home to the tar sands of northern Alberta, is the fourth-largest oil producer in the world after Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, and for weeks, pro-oil Canadian politicians have called for the expansion of fossil fuel projects in response to the Ukraine crisis. On Tuesday, environmentalists welcomed Ottawa’s plan, but said they would be watching its implementation closely. “The government’s new plan marks the first time that the oil and gas sector is being asked to significantly reduce emissions, even if it still isn’t enough and is more focused on public funding of risky techno-fixes than the proven solution of transitioning to clean energy,” Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace Canada, said in a statement. “Given three decades of successful oil industry lobbying against implementation of past climate plans, it is vital that people hold all politicians’ feet to the fire to make sure they force industry to do its fair share. We need real action this time.” Canada’s West Coast Environmental Law Association also said the plan does not show “a complete path” to the reductions promised, but was a good step that provides more accountability to ensure the government meets its commitments. “Canada has failed to meet every single climate target it has set for itself,” Anna Johnston, a staff lawyer with the group, said in a statement. “Hopefully, we stay on track, and even increase our ambition to the 60 percent reduction needed for us to do our global fair share.”  Follow Al Jazeera English: ",www.aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/29/canada-unveils-multi-billion-dollar-plan-to-cut-carbon-emissions,
,,,"LIVE NOW: CTV News Channel NUSA DUA, Indonesia -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrived in Bali for an Asia-Pacific leaders' summit Sunday bearing what could be called a $36-billion vote of confidence from Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company. Malaysian Prime Minister Mohd Najib sprung the ""gargantuan"" investment figure during a joint availability with Harper in Putrajaya, saying Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company Petronas has committed to construction of a liquid natural gas plant in British Columbia and the pipeline to feed it. ""I'm told that this is the largest direct foreign investment in Canada by any country,"" Najib said, flanked by Harper following a formal welcoming ceremony at a sprawling new government precinct outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. Click to see a map of the countries and their issues Najib called it a ""significant landmark decision"" by Petronas, which last year spent more than $5 billion buying Alberta-based Progress Energy Inc. The Petronas takeover, and a bigger oil patch buyout by China's state-owned CNOOC, prompted months of hand-wringing by the Harper government. It approved the deals late last year but at the same time introduced new rules that permit majority takeovers of Canadian companies by state-owned enterprises only in the most exceptional circumstances. The policy change put a major chill on direct foreign investment in Canada by so-called SOEs, and analysts have recently begun questioning whether the Conservative policy shift is scaring off much-needed foreign capital. Najib rode to Harper's defence Sunday, calling the promised Petronas infrastructure investment a testament ""to the level of confidence we have in the policies of the Canadian government."" Harper's reaction to the news was almost muted, by contrast. ""Look, we view the Petronas investments very positively and all the indications I have is that Petronas is looking at further investment,"" said the prime minister. ""The government of Canada is very excited about that possibility, as are all those I've talked to in the energy sector."" However the Prime Minister's Office declined to provide any details of the promised $36 billion investment, referring reporters to Petronas for details. Provincial officials in B.C. had spoken in June of a $19 billion LNG plant and pipeline investment by Petronas, and it wasn't clear Sunday where the whopping new total comes from. Both Najib and Harper flew their separate delegations to Indonesia following the Sunday morning meeting in Malaysia. Regardless, the announcement provides Harper a much-needed shot in the arm as he brings Canada's trade and investment message to Bali. Harper has been involved in an increasingly acrimonious and very public tussle with U.S. President Barack Obama over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to take Alberta bitumen south, and is meeting stiff resistance within Canada to the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline to the B.C. coast. The Conservatives have also failed to seal the major trade pacts they've been negotiating, and Najib appeared to confirm Sunday that the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving 12 Pacific Rim counties including Canada, won't meet its year-end target for completing a framework agreement. So Harper, who has prorogued parliament and will deliver a throne speech Oct. 16 setting out a new government agenda, needs some good economic news to bolster his case. Najib was asked by a Malaysian reporter what guarantees Petronas had been given on its multi-billion-dollar Canadian investment ""over 30 years."" The investment has a long horizon, Najib agreed, adding he is confident that not only the current Conservative government would support Petronas's Canadian involvement, but so would future governments. Harper, who has never shied from throwing partisan jabs while representing Canada abroad, took the opportunity to take a swipe at both the Liberals and the NDP. He said Liberals have always approved any foreign investment ""no matter what,"" and that New Democrats ""are ideologically opposed to investment."" Harper said his government judges each foreign investment ""on its merits"" and called it a policy of ""discretion."" It's a fine balance for a Conservative government that says it is courting Asian markets and wants to make Canada an ""emerging energy super power"" but has faced a backlash from its political base over foreign -- especially Communist Chinese -- state-owned enterprise takeovers. The policy shift has not been welcomed in China, noted analyst Yuen Pau Woo, president of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada. Malaysia, which has few state-owned enterprises, won't much mind, Woo said in an interview -- ""they're in the barn already"" -- but China has a host of state-owned companies looking to expand and Canada is not sending welcoming signals. Harper said all western governments have some tough choices to make but that Canada is well positioned. ""Look, it's no international secret that the rise of China and of Asia in the minds of all of us is likely to be one of the dominant realities of the coming century,"" Harper said Sunday. ""Western countries certainly will have their place in the world -- provided that we make good decisions."" He said Canada must ""avoid some of the pitfalls of other western countries,"" without citing any foreign examples. Budgetary and political gridlock in Washington has shut down the U.S. government and will prevent President Obama from attending the APEC summit here. Najib graciously offered that Asia's rise will be a global boon ""and we believe that we should prosper together.""

The federal government is cutting the amount of financial relief small businesses will receive from carbon pricing revenues so it can increase the size of the rebate it is providing to rural families. Ottawa is kicking in an extra $2 billion in financing for the recently announced BC Builds program, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday. Justice Minister Arif Virani says the government will expand a legal advice hotline for war-displaced Ukrainians in Canada to help them understand their rights and navigate the immigration system. Canada's mental health and addictions minister believes fear and stigma are driving criticism of the government's decision to support prescribing pharmaceuticals to drug users to combat the country's overdose crisis. Canada has nixed plans to make oral arguments at the International Court of Justice about Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.

,,"Varcoe: Smith to talk 'energy, energy and energy' with Trudeau this week — including the future of LNG","Premier Danielle Smith expects to meet face-to-face with Justin Trudeau on Friday when the prime minister travels to Calgary for Stampede, and energy issues will be high on the agenda.  While the province has been girding for a showdown with Ottawa over a net-zero power grid and an oilpatch emissions cap, the premier is pointing to an area where they can find common ground: LNG.     And she may have an ally in the debate — other premiers from Western Canada.  “I have a sit-down with (the prime minister). His people said I can have three topics. I said, ‘OK — energy, energy and energy,” Smith told a Calgary Chamber of Commerce luncheon last week.  Smith said there was a “very constructive conversation” on energy at the recent western premiers meeting in B.C. “B.C. Premier David Eby is very keen to work with us to see if there’s a way that we can get global credit for reducing emissions in Japan, South Korea or India or China.”  Last week at the meeting in Whistler, B.C., the provincial and territorial leaders issued a joint statement, which stressed Canada has an important role to play in global energy security, such as supplying oil and gas to other countries.  Exporting low or zero-emitting LNG — along with hydrogen and hydro — can help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, the communique states.  “Premiers renew their call on the federal government to support emission credit trading across international borders and work with provinces and territories to finalize the rules under Article 6 (of the Paris agreement) to ensure they receive credit for reductions resulting from actions in their jurisdictions.” Your weekday lunchtime roundup of curated links, news highlights, analysis and features.     Article 6 has become a key issue for Alberta and LNG proponents, as it could see western Canadian natural gas exported to other countries and, if the product supplants higher-emitting sources such as coal, receive credit for it.  The Trudeau government has set out an ambitious target to reduce oilpatch emissions by 42 per cent by 2030, while the B.C. government’s own climate plan aims to curb its emissions by 40 per cent by the end of this decade.  The trading mechanism could provide Canada — and B.C. — with a tangible way to reach those goals while also increasing gas output and bringing new LNG projects online.  “They (Ottawa) now understand that in talking about carbon capture utilization and storage, and hydrogen, and exporting LNG and getting credit for it through the Paris accord, those are the things where I think that we will find a lot of common cause,” Smith told the chamber.  Stewart Muir of the Resource Works Society, a Vancouver-based group that advocates for natural resource development, said he was “floored” by the unified statement from the western premiers on LNG and Article 6, saying it represents a step forward.  In March, the B.C. government unveiled a new energy framework that mandates all proposed LNG developments must pass an emissions test and have a credible net-zero plan by 2030. Muir said it appears B.C.’s premier is continuing to soften his stance on LNG.  “It almost feels like there’s a subtext to this . . . All of the (premiers) from the West are saying the same thing — ‘We are unified on it. Hey, prime minister, if you want to join us in this, be our guest.’”  The future of LNG has been a focal point for Alberta as the province hopes to see more projects built to ship super-chilled liquefied natural gas from West Coast facilities to customers in Asia.  However, environmental groups oppose a major expansion, with Clean Energy Canada saying last month that continued growth of LNG “is a bet that the world won’t achieve net zero.”  The prolific Montney formation, in Alberta and northeast British Columbia, produced just under half of all Canadian gas last year and it could significantly increase output.  Canada has two liquefied natural gas projects moving ahead, the Shell-backed LNG Canada development at Kitimat and the Woodfibre LNG initiative near Squamish, B.C. A final investment decision is also expected later this year on the proposed Cedar LNG project.  Investment decisions by LNG project proponents will be made “based on their ability to comply with federal and provincial regulatory standards and be competitive within the global market,” Keean Nembhard, press secretary for federal Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, said in a statement.  New LNG projects would need to demonstrate they are displacing higher-emitting energy sources, he said.  If all of the LNG projects now on the table go ahead, it could represent a reduction in global emissions of 89 megatonnes by displacing the use of coal and diesel, Smith said.  And what effect will Canada’s commitment to reach net-zero emissions have on provincial aspirations?  A report issued by the Canada Energy Regulator last month projected that under a global net-zero scenario, LNG exports from the country would ramp up to two billion cubic feet per day per day by the end of this decade — from the LNG Canada and Woodfibre facilities — but not increase beyond that, before beginning to decline in 2045.  In a mid-range scenario where Canada reached net zero by 2050 but other countries lag behind, a second phase of the LNG Canada project would proceed and total exports would increase to 3.8 bcf a day in 2030 and stay there through 2050.  Under existing policies, Canadian LNG exports would rise to 4.6 bcf in 2034 and remain at that level through 2050.  Any plan to increase LNG will require the provincial and federal governments to see eye to eye on the future benefits of such exports, and work together to make it happen expeditiously.

,,"With Trudeau’s Trans Mountain deal, Alberta’s Ottawa-hates-us narrative is hard to justify"," ENERGY With the pipeline in federal hands, and Alberta politicians high-fiving each other, any antagonistic relationship will be hard to sustain Alberta Premier Rachel Notley high fives Finance Minister Joe Ceci at a press conference to speak about the Kinder Morgan pipeline project, in Edmonton on Tuesday, May 29, 2018.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson While there are many Canadians with mixed emotions about the federal government’s $4.5-billion rescue purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline, spare a thought for two particular groups: the hardcore protesters who spent hours making giant “Stop Kinder Morgan” signs, and the pro-pipeline Albertans convinced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau secretly wanted to join haughty Quebeckers and hippies from Vancouver in screwing over the oil sands. Those protestors need new signs to decry the same old pipeline under new public ownership. And the anti-Trudeau Albertans must face the fact that Trudeau is willing to take a massive financial and political stake in a bitumen pipeline’s success, and bringing along with it tax dollars of every Quebecker, British Columbian and all the rest of us. Conservative critics liked to point to Trudeau policies like a federal carbon tax and tougher environmental assessments as a reprise of his father’s Alberta-harming National Energy Program (NEP, still the dirtiest acronym in much of Alberta). But to recall a bigger pro-oil-sands plum than this, you’d have to reach back before the Harper government and its “energy superpower” boosterism to 1996 and another Liberal prime minister: Jean Chretien, and his massive tax-deduction program for oil sands mining that begat the Fort McMurray boom and two decades worth of multibillion-dollar megaprojects. It also helped secure a period of collegiality between Chretien and then-premier Ralph Klein (punctuated, albeit, by the sort of sniping Alberta conservatives are constitutionally bound to direct towards Liberal Ottawa). And if Alberta’s current premier was already cultivating chumminess with Justin Trudeau, both echoing the economy-plus-environment rhetoric on carbon policy, the love blossomed on Tuesday. Notley seized upon the Trans Mountain buyout as occasion for an outdoor celebration with her governing NDP caucus. “We said we would get the pipeline built, and we are getting it built,” Notley told reporters, as her elected human backdrop applauded and hooted. She acknowledged there were more challenges ahead, but added: “In the meantime, to all Albertans: pick up those tools, folks. We have a pipeline to get built.” RELATED: Ottawa buying Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline, terminal for $4.5 billion In the head offices of Calgary oil companies, there was some relief that Kinder Morgan’s weak stomach for the political, legal and regulatory challenges of modern pipeline-building didn’t make this the third coast-bound oil conduit to die in three years, after Enbridge’s Northern Gateway in 2016 and TransCanada’s Energy East last year. But that was tempered with the shock that it took the promise of full project nationalization to resuscitate Trans Mountain’s expansion, as well as some awkward acknowledgement that, come August, oil companies would likely be paying their tolls on the existing Trans Mountain pipeline to a Crown corporation. Not since the earlier days of Petro-Canada (started under Pierre Trudeau) has a federal entity stampeded into the oil patch. While Notley said this would provide Trans Mountain the certainty it needed to go forward, her declaration could have used a bundle of asterisks and footnotes. A federal loan to Kinder Morgan will kickstart construction shortly, but it’s still unclear how Ottawa and authorities will deal with protests and civil disobedience in Greater Vancouver, and the pockets of fierce Indigenous resistance along the route. A decision also looms from the Federal Court of Appeal on six First Nations groups’ bid to quash Ottawa’s project approval on the basis of inadequate Indigenous consultation, as well as the B.C. NDP government’s iffy legal query about its ability to restrict bitumen flow into the province. Kinder Morgan wasn’t sure how far Ottawa would go to deal with any setbacks the courts or activists might deal it. It’s now up to Ottawa to act decisively to protect its own large investment and ensure there’s a confident buyer on the other side of this bailout. RELATED: The faulty math behind Trudeau’s reasoning for buying Trans Mountain from Kinder Morgan Alberta, meanwhile, is offering a secondary backstop to Trudeau’s backstop. While details are murky, the province would cover up to $2 billion more in pipeline construction costs should they escalate beyond a unspecified federal comfort level. In return, Alberta would take a piece of Ottawa’s ownership share. This means that while Canadians each get a $121 share in Trans Mountain, every Albertan could be in for an extra $467. There were dark jokes shortly after the New Democrats won election in this Conservatopia, that they’d start nationalizing industry. It was a long, weird, winding road to this joint venture with a Trudeau, and nobody’s clear where this goes next. Neither the NDP premier nor Liberal PM will be hailed as heroes for their dramatic intervention. But at least they avoid becoming scapegoats or villains. That’s a decent victory for them in these weird days in Alberta.

,,LNG Canada Announces a Positive Final Investment Decision,"SEE ALL THE STORIES OCT 01, 2018 PROJECT UPDATES SHARE First large-scale LNG export facility in Canada receives a green light. VANCOUVER, October 1, 2018 – LNG Canada today announced that its joint venture participants – Shell, PETRONAS, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corporation and KOGAS – have taken a Final Investment Decision (FID) to build the LNG Canada export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia, in the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation. “The Final Investment Decision taken by our joint venture participants shows that British Columbia and Canada, working with First Nations and local communities, can deliver competitive energy projects,” said Andy Calitz, CEO of LNG Canada. “This decision showcases how industrial development can co-exist with environmental stewardship and Indigenous interests.” The Rt. Hon. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada said, “Today’s announcement by LNG Canada represents the single largest private sector investment project in Canadian history. It is a vote of confidence in a country that recognizes the need to develop our energy in a way that takes the environment into account, and that works in meaningful partnership with Indigenous communities.” Each joint venture participant will be responsible to provide its own natural gas supply and will individually offtake and market its share of LNG. The FID is for two processing units or “trains,” with first LNG expected before the middle of the next decade. “The project LNG Canada is bringing to northern B.C. symbolizes the kind of balanced and sustainable path forward British Columbians are looking for,” said B.C. Premier John Horgan. “We welcome the unprecedented commitment shown by the LNG Canada partners to work within our province’s ambitious climate goals. The critical importance of this project is what it represents – the intersecting of economic development, jobs for local workers, partnerships with Indigenous communities and forward-looking climate leadership. We’re delighted the global business community sees British Columbia as a natural home for this kind of investment.” LNG Canada has worked towards FID since it first identified Kitimat from a list of 500 potential sites in British Columbia as the ideal location for an LNG export facility. LNG Canada’s export plant has been designed to achieve the lowest carbon intensity of any largescale LNG plant operating in the world today. LNG Canada achieved this through a combination of using renewable hydropower from BC Hydro and highly-efficient gas turbine engines. With demand for LNG expected to double by 2035 compared with today as a result of global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, LNG Canada will provide natural gas to countries where imported gas could displace more carbon intensive energy sources and help to address global climate change and air pollution. “We look forward to helping Canada take its place on the global map of LNG exporting countries and want to recognize the important role played by all levels of government, First Nations and the many people that supported LNG Canada to help us get to an FID,” said Calitz. “We also thank our joint venture participants for their trust in our ability to deliver a cost-competitive and reliable source of LNG for their global portfolios.” LNG Canada is advantaged by access to abundant, low-cost natural gas from British Columbia’s vast reserves and the relatively short shipping distance to North Asia, which is about 50% shorter than from the US Gulf of Mexico and avoids the Panama Canal. The LNG Plant will be constructed on a large, partially-developed industrial site with existing deep-water port, roads, rail and power supplies. Comments from Joint Venture Participants Shell “LNG Canada is an attractive investment opportunity in a strong joint venture, with companies that have deep LNG industry experience,” said Maarten Wetselaar, Integrated Gas and New Energies Director, Royal Dutch Shell. “In the last two years, LNG Canada has improved its competitiveness, reduced execution uncertainty and gained significant stakeholder support. Together with our joint venture participants and contractors, we look forward to working with the local community, First Nations, government and the LNG Canada team to build and operate this game changing project for Canada’s energy industry.” PETRONAS “The final investment decision with our joint venture participants is a significant milestone for PETRONAS and for the energy industry in Canada. The decision is a testimony of the strong collaboration among our partners and stakeholders who share the same aspiration of delivering long-term value via LNG, in line with our commitment to sustainable and responsible development of resources,” said PETRONAS President and Group CEO Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin. PetroChina Company Limited (PetroChina) “PetroChina is proud to be amongst the experienced joint venture participants that approved the Canada-based LNG Canada project today,” said Mr. Wei Gao, CFO of the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development (CNODC). “As PetroChina strives to build a diversified oil and gas portfolio, the LNG Canada project is an attractive investment opportunity. The project’s competitiveness, low carbon emissions and relatively short shipping distance to China mean LNG Canada can help supply the increasing demand for gas in China.” Mitsubishi Corporation “By launching this project, Mitsubishi Corporation will diversify its LNG supply portfolio, which contributes to enabling more stable energy supply to Asian customers,” said Hidenori Takaoka, Group CEO, Energy Business Group, Mitsubishi Corporation. “At the same time, this project will contribute to expanding local employment and economic development opportunities and will have the lowest GHG emissions of any LNG export facility in operations today. This is consistent with Mitsubishi’s goal of generating economic, societal and environmental value.” KOGAS “LNG Canada is Korea’s first major project in Canada,” said Jongkook Lim, Senior Executive Vice President, KOGAS. “LNG Canada is a significant and meaningful opportunity for Canada, as well as for the participants in the Joint Venture. It will provide a great opportunity for Korea to diversify its LNG supply sources and will be an example of LNG projects in Canada that value safety, environment and the local community in the years to come.” –ENDS– Media contact: media@LNGCanada.ca Notes to Editors About LNG Canada The LNG Canada joint venture is building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia, Canada, which will initially consist of two LNG processing units, referred to as “trains.” LNG Canada is a joint venture comprised of Royal Dutch Shell plc, through its affiliate Shell Canada Energy (40%); PETRONAS, through its wholly-owned entity, North Montney LNG Limited Partnership (25%); PetroChina Company Limited, through its subsidiary PetroChina Canada Limited (15%); Mitsubishi Corporation, through its subsidiary Diamond LNG Canada Ltd.

,,NP View: Trudeau puts anti-oil agenda ahead of affordable food,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made a career out of claiming to be fighting for the middle class, but as inflation reaches levels not seen in 30 years, his government has steadfastly refused to do away with government policies that are directly contributing to the affordability crisis in this country. Rather than sticking up for the little guy, the Liberals increasingly look like elitists who place a higher value on their ideological agenda than Canadians’ ability to put affordable food on the table.      In April, the inflation rate hit 6.8 per cent, which is well above the Bank of Canada’s target of two per cent. That same month, Statistics Canada reported that the cost of groceries had risen 9.7 per cent compared to a year earlier, the largest increase since 1981. Meanwhile, the average price of a litre of gasoline across the country was over $2.08 on Tuesday, up from $1.30 a year ago.  Behind the numbers are Canadians facing very real hardships. A recent Mainstreet Research poll found that 23 per cent of respondents said they had been eating less than they believe they should because they couldn’t afford enough food. Food Banks Canada said Canadians visiting a food bank for the first time has increased by 25 per cent in some areas, while Toronto’s Daily Bread Food Bank said visits in March increased 30 per cent year over year.  There are many reasons for all this. Though government and central bank policies have contributed to the problem, inflation has become a global issue caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s continued zero-COVID policy, a global energy crunch and other factors that Canada has little control over. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything Canadian governments can do. This newsletter tackles hot topics with boldness, verve and wit. (Subscriber-exclusive edition on Fridays)     In fact, the solution is actually quite simple: remove the taxes and other regulations that keep prices higher than they need to be, at least until the inflation rate comes back down to earth.  Conservatives seem to get this. Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford won a resounding victory in Ontario last week, partially on a promise to remove provincial fuel taxes for six months. In Ottawa, federal Tories introduced a motion this week calling on the government to remove policies that are directly inflating costs, including eliminating the GST on fuel, removing tariffs on fertilizer and suspending the carbon tax.  Cutting all these taxes would drive the federal deficit even higher, but a responsible government could provide immediate relief to Canadians, while working to reduce expenses over the medium term. Yet the Liberals are not exactly known for their fiscal responsibility. And the NDP, who hold outsized power in Ottawa due to their supply and confidence agreement with the Liberals, have other plans entirely.  On Tuesday, NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the solution to sky-high inflation is to impose an “excess profits tax” on big companies. Exactly how successful a company would need to be in order to be punished by the NDP is not exactly clear. Nor is it clear how “record-setting profits are directly contributing to the cost of living going up,” as Singh insists. What we do know is that Singh believes “the solution has to be redistributing wealth.”  It’s a convoluted strategy that would ultimately cause businesses to invest less in retaining staff and lowering costs, and lead successful companies to move to less hostile jurisdictions.  We would have hoped the Liberals would be a little more grounded in reality. They should at least acknowledge that the federally imposed carbon tax adds over 11 cents to a litre of gasoline, and that the GST raises the average price by about eight cents/litre and is calculated based on the after-tax price, so it ends up being a tax on a tax, and that these contribute not just to high prices at the pump but to increased costs for other goods, such as groceries.  Instead, Liberal MP Rachel Bendayan dismissed the Tory proposal to reduce gas taxes by saying, “There is absolutely no guarantee these large oil and gas companies will pass on any savings to Canadian consumers.” In other words: we’re not 100 per cent certain there’s enough competition among gas stations to ensure they will lower their prices, or prevent them from rising further, if we reduce taxes, so might as well not even try.  Speaking of competition, in response to Conservative and NDP concerns over the cost of living, Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said he had “seized the Competition Bureau to make sure that we would be looking at any practices that could be anti-competitive.” The elephant in the room is that his government is actively fighting our trading partners to ensure their farmers do not get unrestrained access to the Canadian market, so that our dairy, poultry and egg producers can maintain their government-granted supply management monopoly, which serves to keep food prices artificially high.  If Justin Trudeau’s Liberals spent half as much time discussing how their own policies are contributing to the high cost of living as they do blaming inflation on external factors, there would be a real chance of offering some relief to Canadians, especially those living on the margins. Instead, the Liberals are looking increasingly out of touch with the needs of the citizens they are tasked with governing.

,,Petro-Canada,"Petro-Canada (colloquially known as Petro-Can) is a retail and wholesale marketing brand subsidiary of Suncor Energy. Until 1991, it was a federal Crown corporation (a state-owned enterprise). In August 2009, Petro-Canada merged with Suncor Energy, with Suncor shareholders receiving approximately 60 percent ownership of the combined company and Petro-Canada shareholders receiving approximately 40 percent. The company retained the Suncor Energy name for the merged corporation and its upstream operations. It continues to use the Petro-Canada name nationwide. In 1973, world oil prices quadrupled due to the Arab oil embargo following the Yom Kippur War. The province of Alberta had substantial oil reserves, whose extraction had long been controlled by American corporations. The government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the opposition New Democratic Party felt that these corporations geared most of their production to the American market, and as a result little of the benefit of rising oil prices went to Canadians. During debates in the Canadian House of Commons, for example, Tommy Douglas supported the new Crown Corporation by saying: ""It should be remembered that the people of Canada have paid billions of dollars to enlarge and enrich foreign oil companies, and only now, belatedly, are we setting up an economic vehicle to develop our petroleum resources for the benefit of Canadians.""[2] Trudeau's Liberals were then in a minority government and dependent upon the support of the NDP to stay in power. The idea also fit with the growing movement toward economic nationalism within the Liberals. The Liberals and NDP passed the bill over the opposition of the Progressive Conservative Party led by Robert Stanfield. Petro-Canada was founded as a Crown Corporation in 1975 by an act of Parliament. It started its operations on 1 January 1976. The company was given C$1.5 billion in start-up money and easy access to new sources of capital. It was set up in Calgary, despite the hostility of existing oil firms.[citation needed] Its first president was Maurice Strong. The Progressive Conservatives (PCs), then led by Albertan Joe Clark, were opponents of the company, and advocated breaking it up and selling it. However, they were unable to proceed with these plans during their brief time in power in 1979–80. With the establishment of Petro-Canada, the federal government transferred its 45% stake in Panarctic Oils Ltd. and its 12% stake in Syncrude to the newly established company. In 1976, Petro-Canada purchased Atlantic Richfield Canada, in 1978 Pacific Petroleums, and in 1981 the Canadian operations of Petrofina. Most of the original Petro-Canada refineries and service stations were acquired from BP Canada in 1983. The company became popular outside of Alberta as a symbol of Canadian nationalism[citation needed]. It quickly grew to become one of the largest players in the traditional oil fields of the west as well as in the oil sands and the East coast offshore oil fields. When the Liberals returned to power in 1980, energy policy was an important focus, and the sweeping National Energy Program was created. This expanded Petro-Canada, but was seen as detrimental to Alberta's economy. The PC government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (1984–1993) stopped using Petro-Canada as a policy tool (also abandoning the National Energy Program with it), and it began to compete fully and successfully[according to whom?] with the private sector companies while abandoning its founding principles of economic nationalism. In 1990, the Mulroney government announced its intention to privatize Petro-Canada, and the first shares were sold on the open market in July 1991 at $13 each.[citation needed] The government began to slowly sell its majority control, but kept a 19% stake in the company. No other shareholder was allowed to own more than 10%, however. Also, foreigners could not control more than 25% of the company. During the first year, the value of the shares gradually dropped to $8 as Petro-Canada suffered a loss of $603 million, primarily because of the devaluation of some assets.[citation needed] The newly private company significantly reduced the number of properties in which it had a direct interest. It reduced its annual operating costs by $300 million and it went from a staff of close to 11,000 to only about 5,000 employees. Many of these laid-off employees went on to work and start up other oil companies in Alberta, creating a new group of Canadian producers. But many did not work in other oil companies and some left Alberta to find work elsewhere.[citation needed] In his 2004 federal budget, Finance Minister Ralph Goodale pledged to sell the government's remaining stake in the company and by the end of the year it had sold its 19% stake, 49 million shares in all, for net proceeds of $3.2 billion.[3] As of June 2007, the company's largest shareholders were Capital Research and Management Company (a Capital Group company), with 7.3%, and Barclays, with 4%.[4] On March 23, 2009, Suncor Energy announced its intent to acquire Petro-Canada, which would form a company with a combined market capitalization of C$43.3 billion. Suncor planned to rebrand its existing Sunoco-branded retail operations in Ontario under the Petro-Canada name following the completion of the acquisition.[5][6][7][8] The sale was approved by shareholders in June 2009,[9][10] and completed on August 1, 2009.[11][12] As a condition of the purchase, Suncor was required to divest some of its retail outlets. In December 2009, 98 Suncor-owned gas stations in Ontario (68 Sunoco and 30 Petro-Canada) were sold to Husky Energy.[13] As of 2008, Petro-Canada was Canada's 11th largest company and the second-largest downstream company, with important interests in such projects as Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose; its gas stations remained a presence in most Canadian cities. It owned refineries in Edmonton, Alberta (135,000 bpd) and Montreal, Quebec (160,000 bpd), accounting for 16% of the Canadian industry's total refining capacity. All these facilities are currently run by Suncor. Petro-Canada had a lubricants plant in Mississauga, Ontario, but Suncor sold the unit to HollyFrontier in late 2016.[14] At one time, the company had international operations in Algeria, the Netherlands, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, Syria, Italy, Libya, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Morocco and Norway. These sites outside of North America were run by the International and Offshore Business Unit of Petro-Canada with its headquarters in London. This was the largest business unit, and much of its assets were part of the former Veba Oel company based in Essen, Germany. In January 2019, Petro-Canada installed electric vehicle charging stations at one of their gas stations in Milton, Ontario, making it the company's first EV chargers.[15] The following month, Suncor announced that it would develop a national network of charging stations serving the Trans-Canada Highway.[16] As early as the mid-1990s in some Alberta locations, Petro-Canada started opening a new fast-food deli-oriented branded convenience store called Neighbours. Most of these stores are in the GTA.[17] The kitchen provided freshly made sandwiches as well as breakfast and burgers heated from frozen, and in most cases was open from early morning till 9 or 10 in the evening. As of 2013, many of these Neighbours stores have had their kitchens' afternoon and dinner hours drastically slashed and some have been permanently closed and are being rebranded to A&W.[citation needed] In 2006, Petro-Canada launched a pre-paid wireless carrier known as Petro-Canada Mobility. It is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) on the Rogers Wireless network.[citation needed] Petro Points is the chain's loyalty program. Petro-Canada previously offered a co-branded Petro Points MasterCard in partnership with Citibank Canada. In June 2010, CIBC announced its intent to acquire Citibank's Canadian MasterCard portfolio, including the co-branded Petro-Canada cards.[18] Petro Points currently offers bonuses for RBC clients. Around 220 Petro-Canada outlets include a ""SuperWash"" car wash; the majority of these operations use soft touch systems, but some (particularly those that were formerly Sunoco stations) feature touchless equipment instead. Some newer locations feature a ""Glide Auto Wash""—a soft touch tunnel that utilizes a flat conveyor belt rather than the roller-based systems traditionally used. In May 2023, Suncor announced an agreement with Canadian Tire Corporation to convert its over 200 Canadian Tire Gas+ locations to Petro-Canada. This will include integration of Petro Points with Canadian Tire's Triangle Rewards program.[19] Maurice F. Strong, 1976–1978

,,"Trudeau douses excitement over East Coast gas exports, calling business case weak","Trudeau said Canada's best chance of helping its allies may be to supply natural gas via existing pipelines to the U.S. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there has “never been a strong business case” for liquified natural gas exports from Canada’s East Coast to Europe, dealing a blow to those in the energy industry who thought Russia’s invasion of Ukraine presented an opportunity to revive dormant gas projects.  Trudeau made the comments Monday during a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Olaf Scholz, who is visiting Canada for the first time as chancellor. The pair were grilled on the likelihood of Canadian LNG being directly exported to Europe over the next few years as countries such as Germany seek to reduce their reliance on Russian gas, now that the European Union appears determined to isolate President Vladimir Putin’s regime in retaliation for its unprovoked attack on a democratic country.     Geopolitics appear to have created new opportunities for Canadian energy, as importers could be willing to accept higher costs in return for stable supply. However, economics remains a powerful force. Trudeau suggested the long distances between Canada’s most prolific gas fields in Alberta and British Columbia to proposed liquefaction projects in places such as Saint John, N.B., have previously made direct export to Europe uneconomic.  “We are looking right now and companies are looking at whether or not the new context makes it a worthwhile business case to make those investments,” Trudeau said, adding the federal government would be willing to ease regulatory hurdles to assist its allies.  “But there needs to be a business case. It needs to make sense for Germany to be receiving LNG directly from the East Coast. Those are discussions that are ongoing right now between our ministers, between various companies to see if indeed it makes sense,” Trudeau said.  The two leaders spoke at length about the challenge of safeguarding the energy security of Western democracies during the news conference in Montreal Monday. The leaders, along with numerous federal cabinet ministers, will gather this week for meetings on investment and partnership opportunities in the areas such as critical minerals and the automotive sector.  Trudeau said Canada’s best chance of helping its allies may be to continue supplying natural gas to global markets via existing pipelines to the United States, and then eventually through LNG exports on Canada’s West Coast, where the country’s only export terminal is under construction.  “We are looking at every possible different way to help out the German people and Europeans in the short term as they face a real challenge this coming winter and the next as Russia continues to squeeze off gas supply,” Trudeau said.  The German chancellor is facing an energy crisis at home where European natural gas prices have hit record levels on fears that Russian supply cuts could tip the German economy into recession.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last February disrupted global energy flows, including the main route through which Russian gas flows to Germany: the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Gas flows on the key pipeline were temporarily halted last month for maintenance work and a second temporary shut down is anticipated on Aug. 31 — disruptions which have jeopardized the region’s plans to store additional gas for the winter.  Germany has been on the hunt for alternative sources of gas to end its dependence on Russia — but despite Canada’s abundant supply, the lack of an operational LNG export terminal has made it an unlikely near-term solution.  Instead, discussions leading up to Scholz’s visit have centred around hydrogen.  Germany has expressed an interest in “green” hydrogen from Canada, made using renewable power sources like wind. However, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Friday that Canada’s ally has not ruled out hydrogen made using natural gas and carbon capture — the method most common in Alberta where the bulk of Canada’s hydrogen is produced.  Scholz is expected to sign an energy development agreement with Trudeau for the exploration and production of renewable hydrogen for export to Germany during his visit. The agreement will be signed when the pair visit Stephenville, N.L. on Tuesday.  Despite the cool language from the prime minister on East Coast LNG, proponents of the sector say they’re encouraged that Ottawa is looking closely at the opportunities available.  “I think the case is stronger than he’s giving it credit for,” said Timothy Egan, chief executive of the Canadian Gas Association. “The thing I draw from his comments is that he speaks about a willingness to revisit the regulatory framework. And if you revisit the regulatory framework, those business cases become stronger fast.”  During Monday’s press conference Scholz also thanked the Trudeau government for its decision to exempt Siemens Canada from federal sanctions that would have prevented the company from performing maintenance on a gas turbine bound for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline.  The exemption, which was opposed by Ukraine, allows the return of a repaired turbine for use in the pipeline owned by Russia’s state-controlled Gazprom. Both Trudeau and Scholz defended the move Monday, arguing that Moscow has sought to weaponize energy, reducing gas supplies to Europe while attempting to pit western governments against each other.  Scholz’s visit began late Sunday and will end in Newfoundland on Tuesday with the signing of the hydrogen accord. The chancellor and Trudeau last met in June on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Germany where the pair reportedly discussed energy security and accelerating the global transition to clean energy.

,,Suncor to keep Petro-Canada retail business after conducting review,"Keeping and optimizing the retail business will generate the highest long-term value for shareholders. Author of the article: Suncor Energy Inc. has decided to keep its Petro-Canada retail business, the company announced Tuesday, after a comprehensive review that included what it would mean to sell the operations.      The company said instead it will look to improve its retail operations including expanding strategic partnerships in non-fuel related businesses such as quick service restaurants, convenience stores, loyalty partnerships and energy transition offerings.  Suncor undertook a review of Petro-Canada after reaching a deal earlier this year with activist investor Elliott Investment Management LP, which had expressed frustration with the company’s performance.  Suncor chair Mike Wilson says the company’s board concluded that keeping and optimizing the retail business will generate the highest long-term value for shareholders.  “Petro-Canada is a unique, differentiated, and strategic asset due to its strong national network and best in market consumer brand and loyalty program,” Wilson said in a statement.  The review included an analysis of the business, including an assessment of the value of Suncor’s integrated model, studies of the future of retail in Canada and Petro-Canada’s growth plans.  Suncor said the board also reviewed preliminary indications of interest in the retail business.  The decision to keep the retail business came as Suncor announced its production outlook and capital program for 2023.  Capital expenditures in 2023 are forecast to be between $5.4 billion and $5.8 billion.  The company says it expects total production next year is expected to be between 740,000 to 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Refinery throughput for 2023 is expected to be 430,000 to 445,000 barrels per day with refinery utilization between 92 and 96 per cent.  Refined product sales are expected to be between 550,000 and 580,000 barrels per day.   365 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Ontario, M4W 3L4  ",torontosun.com,https://torontosun.com/business/money-news/suncor-to-keep-petro-canada-retail-business-after-conducting-review,"© 2024 Toronto Sun, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

,,Of pipe dreams and fossil fools: Advancing Canadian fossil fuel hegemony through the Trans Mountain pipeline,"This article uses the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project as a Canadian case study to critically examine and showcase one instance of the hegemony of fossil fuels in the era of global heating. The present Canadian federal government, under the leadership of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is seeking to simultaneously position itself as a global climate leader while supporting the exploitation of Canada’s extensive bitumen oil reserves. We apply a critical discourse analysis to seven speeches given between 2016 and 2019 by two members of the Canadian federal government on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project to interrogate how the government discursively reconciles these two contradicting stances. Our analysis yields three main results: 1) the government naturalizes bitumen as a substance, culturally and politically hindering the capacity for Canada to move beyond it, 2) the extraction of bitumen is portrayed as an imperative, implicating the overall economic and social health of Canada and justifying the government’s use of coercion and 3) appeals to climate change and action are paradoxically subsumed into the argument for bitumen extraction. Overall, we argue, this discourse depoliticizes the social and environmental struggles surrounding bitumen extraction. It functions to maintain the hegemony of fossil fuels in the era of global heating, thus foreclosing on possibilities of leaving the fuels in the ground while reinforcing Canadian bitumen’s multi-dimensional carbon lock-in.

,,Yogi Schulz’s Post,"  Corvelle Drives Concepts to Completion I understand the opposition to a writedown. However, who in their right mind would buy the TransMountain pipeline at a higher price to lose money?
Canadians should understand that the following actions have serious consequences:
1. Lobbying the government not to build any more pipelines to increase the energy cost for Canadians.
2. Lobbying the government to drag out the permitting process to increase construction costs through the cost of lawyers and high-cost, low-value stipulations.
3. Protesting the pipeline construction in ways that courts have found to be illegal and add to the construction cost.
4. Assigning government employees, with little or no relevant experience, to manage the construction of a multi-billion dollar pipeline. That's bound to add construction costs.
Most Canadian taxpayers have likely forgotten that they paid for the loss on the sale of Petro-Canada. We're about to repeat the experience by paying for the loss on the sale of the TransMountain pipeline. My guesstimate is that the loss will be about $20 billion. Imagine what impact that amount could have on debt reduction or healthcare improvements.

Adding a bunch more to the tariff rate is going to impact shipping out of the port in Vancouver but you might be able to ship more to the Anacortes refineries.  The subscribers to the pipeline, I understand, are already balking at tariff increases.
If the Liberals don't write it down they are just sweeping the damage under the rug, Managing Director (Canada) The budget overrun was due to Canadian bureaucratic neurosis and cultural/environmental navel-gazing, COVID, some budget padding? and some project management/legal bumbling due to the ownership handoff from private to public ownership at a premium price. 
And now comes the costs for the ownership handoff from public to private ownership? 
Or did we forget all that? Retired from the Rat Race at Retired from the Rat Race! Your points are well taken Yogi but you forgot to mention how much it cost the Canadian taxpayer when Trudeau Senior tried to Canadianize the oil patch by creating Petro Canada in the first place!
They paid double for most oil companies and about triple for Petrofina!  What a total disgrace and a complete farce! To view or add a comment, sign in Corvelle Drives Concepts to Completion Trust the NDP to claim again it’s helping the little guy or people experiencing poverty when that’s not true. Hiking minimum wages helps no one.
Some studies about the effect of minimum-wage hikes suggest that the gains of some people are offset by others losing their jobs. Sometimes, employers:
1.      Can’t make money with higher-paid employees, lays them off and closes the business.
2.      Lay off the employees and replace them with automation.
3.      Lay off the employees and replace them with services from a cheaper third-world country.
Most often, employers pass on the cost of higher wages to customers in the form of higher prices. Higher prices tend to slow the economy as it reduces consumption.
The best answer to helping people earn more money is to help them improve their education and build more skills.
Meddling with market forces, an NDP specialty, typically helps no one.

#graphdatabase #relationaldatabase  To view or add a comment, sign in Corvelle Drives Concepts to Completion This opinion piece makes various false claims, such as:
1.      Oil and natural gas producers are “awash in cash and hungry” and should, therefore, invest more in reducing GHG emissions. Producers are currently profitable. However, that observation ignores many years when producers failed to pay dividends, and a few declared bankruptcy.
2.      “The industry isn’t spending significantly on decarbonizing its operations.” Not true; the industry is spending on decarbonizing and on abandonment.
3.      “An emissions cap will obligate companies to spend a significant amount on decarbonizing.” Not true; an emissions cap will increase risk and is more likely to cause investors to invest elsewhere. We’ve already observed $ billions leave Alberta.
4.      “Implementing carbon capture and storage” can reduce GHG emissions, but it comes at a cost that producers don’t want to pay and consumers may not.
5.     “The energy transition is gaining momentum.” I wish that were true. Investment in low-carbon electricity generation is not keeping up with growth in global energy demand.
6.      “The European Union is developing emissions intensity requirements for fossil fuel imports.” True. However, it’s not clear whether these will be implemented, given current energy insecurity and high consumer prices.
7.      “Run the risk of hosting potentially billions of dollars worth of stranded assets in the next decades” is a highly unlikely scare tactic, given increased global demand.

1. A significant LNG sales opportunity for Canada in Asia.
2. How important coal-fired electricity generation is to China, India and Indonesia due to significant local coal resources.
3. How the higher cost of LNG, compared to coal, will delay the energy transition.
#energytransition  To view or add a comment, sign in Corvelle Drives Concepts to Completion I hope Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Wilkinson is trying to satisfy everyone with his comment that the Biden administration’s pause of LNG project approval is “Doing the Right Thing.”
Those who are against more LNG and want to accelerate the energy transition will be encouraged even though their ideas are more likely to result in economic destruction and high government debt than progress on addressing climate change.
Those favouring more LNG to reduce GHG emissions in Asia while enhancing Canadian growth, jobs and taxes will fear more delays and regulations.
Canada now has a second opportunity to develop our natural gas resources for LNG. Let’s not pass up this opportunity like the previous time.

,,CHARBONNEAU: Not your father’s minority government,"PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU’S minority government is not like his father’s. When Pierre Trudeau won a minority government in 1972, he didn’t have the support of opposition parties. The government only lasted one year, 221 days. His minority government introduced the unpopular Petro-Canada Crown Corporation that reminded Albertans of the despised National Energy Program. Petro-Canada’s reddish-coloured headquarters in Calgary were tagged “red square.” Given the bluster from the United Conservative Party of Alberta, you wouldn’t think that the Liberals have any support from the Conservatives until you consider that they both want the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) built. Consider the following, suggests my Calgary friend: “I think the Conservatives and Liberals are not that far apart on the pipeline issue. If the Liberals make good on our $4.5 billion investment in the TMX they will get no support from the NDP or the Bloc but the Conservatives would be foolish not to support it.” Wouldn’t that be something to behold? If the NDP or the Bloc Québécois opposed a pro-pipeline bill, how could the Conservatives not support it without appearing hypocritical? And the NDP and Bloc could then wash their hands of the project that offends environmentalists. Justin Trudeau has consistently said that he is going to build the Trans Mountain pipeline. He repeated that goal after the October 21, 2109 election. While reactions to the federal election have focused on a divided country, I see Justin Trudeau’s Liberals offering something for everyone. The Liberals and the Bloc Québécois can work together on social policy and the environment. The Bloc Québécois has made it clear that they intend to support this Liberal minority government. BQ Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said that the Liberals should do “what it takes” to make Parliament work. He added there’s a law stating that government mandates are supposed to last four years. I’m not sure that’s true for minority governments but Blanchet’s support is clear. Who knows? If successful, Trudeau’s minority government could be re-elected — as was a minority government in 1965, one before Pierre Trudeau’s. The NDP and the Liberals have the common goal of implementing pharmacare. Both parties campaigned on bringing the much-needed plan into reality. Canada is an anomaly among nations. We are the only industrialized country with a universal public health care system but no pharmacare. Every study of Canada’s health care has identified the lack of pharmacare as a major gap in our system. Medicare without drug coverage doesn’t even make sense. What good is a health care system that prescribes drugs but doesn’t cover them? Justin Trudeau’s minority government should look to the accomplishments of minority governments before his father’s. Lester Pearson’s Liberals implemented universal health care with the cooperation of the NDP. And his minority government was so successful that it was re-elected as a minority government with back-to-back Liberal minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965. How fitting is it that this minority government complete the medicare program started by minority governments, a goal not attempted by his father? —— Editor’s Note: This opinion piece reflects the views of its author, and does not necessarily represent the views of CFJC Today or the Jim Pattison Broadcast Group.  460 Pemberton Terrace

,,"Trudeau muddies the waters on LNG, as he signs green hydrogen deal with Germany","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz signed on to a highly-anticipated but non-binding “hydrogen alliance” during a ceremony Tuesday in Stephenville, Newfoundland, capping three days of meetings that delivered new momentum for green energy development but mixed messages on the two countries’ future interest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. One observer said the two countries’ joint declaration of intent, which calls for green hydrogen shipments from Canada to Germany to begin in 2025, was likely the first global trade deal for renewable hydrogen or its more easily-transported derivative, green ammonia. In Stephenville, Trudeau called the bilateral commitment to build a trans-Atlantic hydrogen supply chain by 2030 a historic moment, CBC reports. “We must look to resources like hydrogen which can and will be clean and renewable. We can be the reliable supplier of clean energy a net-zero world needs,” he said. “The need for clean energy is almost limitless, and that’s where Canada, and Atlantic Canada specifically, gets to step up. With our renewable resources, we have a huge advantage.” “We believe that Atlantic Canada presents a huge opportunity for us, but also for Canada to contribute to a green energy transition,” Scholz said, adding that his country will be looking for 90 to 110 terawatt-hours of hydrogen by 2030. “Canada is a close and like-minded partner in the energy transition.” The coverage of Scholz’ visit pointed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the intense energy supply crisis confronting Germany as a result, as the context for a faster shift to renewables. “”We cannot as a world continue to rely on authoritarian countries that will weaponize energy policy as Russia is, that don’t concern themselves with environmental outcomes, or labour rights or even human rights,” Trudeau said. Yet “the joint declaration of intent makes clear the agreement is not legally binding and stipulates it will be up to Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources and Germany’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action to keep track of whether it’s making progress on its goals,” the Globe and Mail writes. “The Canadian-German agreement sets no targets for volumes of hydrogen produced and contains no commitments of new money to help commence exports to Europe by 2025.” Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said the volumes of product that Canada can export that quickly “are probably going to be modest,” acknowledging that the timeline is “very ambitious”. But that “reflects the fact that Germany sees how this can help them in their current context,” with an immediate need to break free of Russian fossil fuels as soon as possible. “Part of this is being driven by the desire to displace Russian gas,” Wilkinson said. But behind the bid for clarity and speed on the green hydrogen deal, Scholz’ visit featured a sequence of mixed messages on whether Canada and Germany see a future for liquefied natural gas exports from Canada’s East Coast. Since the beginning of Russia’s war, Canadian fossil fuel companies have been pushing hard to resurrect LNG export schemes that had already been rejected for economic or environmental reasons. Analysts and observers have been explaining for months that the projects wouldn’t go into production in time to address Germany’s immediate need, and the country’s commitment to rapid decarbonization would soon wipe out the demand that would justify a longer-term import/export deal. We believe that Atlantic Canada presents a huge opportunity for us, but also for Canada to contribute to a green energy transition. As The Energy Mix reported last week, when the Canadian and German governments announced Scholz’ itinerary almost two weeks ago, neither the word “liquefied” nor the acronym “LNG” showed up in either official statement. Later news reports confirmed that LNG would not be on the agenda for the three days of deliberations. But none of that stopped Trudeau and Scholz from confusing matters when discussions went live. At a news conference in Montreal Monday, the two leaders “appeared to pour cold water on the idea of shipping Canadian natural gas to Europe,” with Trudeau pointing to the cost and complex logistics of shipping gas from Western Canada “to a still-unbuilt liquefaction terminal on the Atlantic coast,” CBC reports. “One of the challenges around LNG is the amount of investment required to build infrastructure for that,” Trudeau said. “There has never been a strong business case because of the distance from the gas fields, because of the need to transport that gas over long distances before liquefaction.” He said Canada’s “best” contribution to the global gas market would be to ship product to Asia (which brings its own set of serious challenges), or via pipeline to the United States, freeing up supplies that Germany could more easily acquire from other exporters. While Canada would be willing to ease regulatory hurdles for LNG exports, “there needs to be a business case,” Trudeau added. “It needs to make sense for Germany to be receiving LNG directly from the East Coast. Those are discussions that are ongoing right now between our ministers, between various companies, to see if indeed it makes sense.” Scholz agreed that any LNG deal would need a business case, “because if it’s too expensive, it will not fly.” But Trudeau still held open the possibility that LNG bound for Germany might be “doable”, with Scholz adding that Germany “would really like Canada to export more” gas to Europe. “As Germany is moving away from Russian energy at warp speed, Canada is our partner of choice,” he said, during a German-Canadian economic conference in Toronto. “For now, this means increasing our LNG imports. We hope that Canadian LNG will play a major role in this.” “We are creating the atmosphere for very direct talks between the business sectors of Canada and Germany [to see] if there is something which could be done now in this very crisis,” the German chancellor told Power & Politics host Vassy Kapelos. “But this is part of the follow-up between the businesspeople of the two countries.” One of the challenges around LNG is the amount of investment required to build infrastructure for that. In the fog of comments and counter-comments, it wasn’t immediately clear how seriously either leader was advocating for direct LNG trade between the two countries. “Asked if there had been developments making new Canadian LNG projects more likely since Monday, a government source with knowledge of the talks said there had been ‘no change’ and Scholz was ‘well aware of sort of the timeline that would be associated’ with new Canadian LNG,” Reuters wrote Tuesday. At the same time, with winter approaching and its own supplies in doubt, Germany “is quite keen for gas from just about anywhere,” the Reuters source added. Reaction from Canadian civil society reflected the layered message coming out of Scholz’ three-day visit. “After months of discussions focussed on East Coast liquified natural gas (LNG), the visit results in a welcome shift in rhetoric and focus towards green hydrogen,” Climate Action Network-Canada said in a statement. “At a moment when the Canadian fossil fuel industry has been intensifying its lobbying efforts and instrumentalizing the invasion of Ukraine to promote fossil fuel expansion, the Canada-Germany Hydrogen Alliance offers a glimpse of economic opportunity and job creation beyond oil and gas,” CAN-Rac added. “As Canada’s domestic ‘clean hydrogen’ strategy continues to blur the lines between renewable and fossil-based hydrogen, the Canadian government has the chance to learn from Germany’s clear categorization and focus on green hydrogen.” “There’s something beautiful about wind power from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia blowing away petro-power in Europe,” added Greenpeace Canada Senior Energy Strategist Keith Stewart. “Fossil fuels are at the core of the current conflicts in Europe and around the world, whether they are paying for weapons or fueling climate disasters.  So it is great they’re signing a deal proving renewable energy is the way forward, even though they can’t quite bring themselves to shut the door completely on LNG just yet.” But that opening still raised flags with some CAN-Rac member groups. “While we are encouraged to see the new Canada-Germany agreement for production and export of green hydrogen, we are concerned that the door is being left open to blue hydrogen fuel,” said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence Canada. “Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil fuels, is not a clean fuel, and in fact may contribute just as much greenhouse gas emissions as burning gas, or even more. The world needs truly clean, renewable energy sources now.” “We welcome the race toward a zero-emissions economy,” said Louise Comeau, director of climate change and energy solutions at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. “We need to run that race with fair rules of engagement for communities and companies,” and “liquefied natural gas is not a legitimate contestant in this race. It won’t cross the finishing line in time to help Germany or the planet.” This article is republished from The Energy Mix. Read the original article.

All five primary investors have signed off on the project. (LNG Canada/Flickr) A consortium of five international investors has given its final approval for a massive liquefied national gas project in northern British Columbia that has the potential to turn Canada into an LNG export powerhouse. The partners — Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi Corp., the Malaysian-owned Petronas, PetroChina Co. and Korean Gas Corp. — have agreed to the $40-billion joint venture that includes a gas liquefaction plant in Kitimat on B.C.’s Pacific coast and a 670-kilometre pipeline delivering natural gas from Dawson Creek in the northeast corner of the province. “We believe LNG Canada is the right project, in the right place, at the right time,” said Ben van Beurden, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, which holds a 40-per-cent stake in the joint venture. “Supplying natural gas over the coming decades will be critical as the world transitions to a lower carbon energy system.” Global LNG demand is expected to double by 2035, with much of this growth coming from Asia where gas displaces coal, van Beurden said. Canada is ideally positioned to benefit from this increased demand as the cost to deliver LNG from Canada into Asian is expected to be structurally advantaged compared to the U.S. Gulf coast, van Beurden said. Each participating company will be responsible to provide its own natural gas supply and will individually market its share of liquefied gas. The decision involves two processing units, with the first liquefied natural gas expected before the middle of the next decade. LNG Canada CEO Andy Calitz said the project received support from the government of British Columbia, local Indigenous communities and the Kitimat community. “This decision showcases how industrial development can co-exist with environmental stewardship and Indigenous interests,” he said in a news release late Monday.

(Darryl Dyck/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Meanwhile, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the LNG Canada announcement represents the “single largest private sector investment project” in Canadian history. “It shows what’s possible when you collaborate and consult with Indigenous and local communities, when you coordinate all orders of government and when people insist on economic, environmental and socially responsible development of our natural resources,” Trudeau said, speaking at the announcement in Vancouver. The project will mean 10,000 jobs at the height of construction, tens of billions of indirect government revenues and hundreds of millions of dollars in construction contracts for First Nations businesses, Trudeau said. LNG Canada will have the lowest carbon intensity of any large scale LNG project in the world, Trudeau said. “In the 21st century we don’t have to choose between a healthy environment and a strong economy, they must go together,” Trudeau said. The investment is proof that Canada’s rich natural resources and its talented workforce can make it into an attractive place for investors to do business and support a clean growth economy, Trudeau said. “Let’s be clear, Shell and its partners did not make this $40-billion investment in Canada as a last resort,” Trudeau said. “It was a choice. It was a vote of confidence in a country that recognizes the need to develop our energy in a way that truly takes the environment into account, and that works in meaningful partnership with Indigenous communities.” Cranes work in the water at the Kitimat LNG site near Kitimat, in northwestern British Columbia on April 13, 2014. (Julie Gordon/REUTERS) B.C. Premier John Horgan said the project makes him very proud. “It is truly a great day for B.C., it is certainly a great day for northern British Columbia,” Horgan said. The announcement couldn’t come at a better time for northern B.C., he said. “For too long, whether it be the beetle kill in our forests, whether it be downturns in mineral and metal prices, we have struggled in northern B.C. to meet the challenges of growth to make sure that people can stay and live and work in their communities,” Horgan said. But provincial Green party Leader Andrew Weaver called the announcement a “profound disappointment.” “Adding such a massive new source of (greenhouse gases) means that the rest of our economy will have to make even more sacrifices to meet our climate targets. A significant portion of the LNG Canada investment will be spent on a plant manufactured overseas, with steel sourced from other countries,” he said in a statement. “B.C. taxpayers will subsidize its power by paying rates twice as high and taking on the enormous public debt required to build Site C. There may be as little as 100 permanent jobs at LNG Canada. I believe we can create far more jobs in other industries that won’t drastically increase our emissions.” Horgan’s minority NDP government only governs because of the support of the Green party. Horgan defended his party’s support of LNG Canada saying in a statement that the project will be the world’s cleanest in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Crystal Smith, chief councillor of the Haisla Nation, became emotional at Tuesday morning’s announcement. “On behalf of our entire nation, we extend our gratitude to Shell, Kogas, Petronas, PetroChina and Mitsubishi for the investment being made in Haisla territory,” she said. “History is unfolding before our eyes… The time is now, it is our time to reignite the true strength of our culture, our language and our Haisla identities.” With files from The Canadian Press and CBC News CATEGORY AUTHOR All rights reserved @ Radio Canada International 2018 Visit our strategic partners ",www.rcinet.ca,https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2018/10/02/lng-canada-investment-ottawa-british-columbia-haisla-nation/,
,,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces $120 million affordable housing investment in Brampton,"   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with construction workers in Brampton while making an announcement that the federal government will be funding 302 affordable housing rental units in Mount Pleasant, which will be ready by summer 2023. - Justin Trudeau Twitter page The federal government is stepping in to help Brampton’s affordable housing crisis, by helping fund a new apartment building. “Far too many families are struggling,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, standing outside the building site in Mount Pleasant Village, where his government is providing $120 million to help built 302 affordable housing units. The investment is being made through the Rental Construction Financing Initiative, part of Canada’s National Housing Strategy, which will invest $72 billion in rentals over the next decade. The new apartments are being built by the Daniels Corporation at 40 Lagerfeld Dr. in Brampton. The 26-storey building will have units with up to three bedrooms available for rent by summer 2023. “We know that finding an affordable place to live is a challenge for many Canadians in communities across the country,” Trudeau said, explaining that in Brampton, buying and renting is out of reach for many. He said these units are for the grocery store workers who can’t find a place to rent, for the young families and professionals who want to stay in the community. “This city is growing at a record speed,” he said, adding that he knows more needs to be done to address housing affordability in Brampton and across Canada.

,,"Foreign Investment In Canada: Past, Present, & Future","              The Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development (""ISEDC"") is responsible for the review and approval of non-cultural foreign investments in Canada. Though review of foreign investment had long been a feature of the Investment Canada Act (the ""ICA"") the former Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper (that governed from 2006 through to late 2015), chose to closely scrutinize its high-profile, politically controversial deals. In October 2015, Canadians elected Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party to a sweeping majority. In its first months in office, the Trudeau government emphasized its commitment to continued foreign investment, and to increasing the transparency of foreign investment reviews. However, it remains uncertain how the change in government will impact foreign investment reviews. This article outlines Canada's foreign investment review regime, discusses the monetary thresholds related to reviews, and summarizes certain deals which have been approved, blocked, or abandoned in the past. It also considers what, if any, changes may be on the horizon in light of the new federal government. Foreign investors are generally subject to the provisions of the ICA, which can require a foreign investor to either file a notification with the federal government up to 30 days following implementation of a proposed investment, or to file an application for review prior to implementation.1 According to the Investment Canada Act — Annual Report 2015-16, in the year ended March 31, 2016, the Minister of the ISEDC received 626 notifications and 15 applications for review under the ICA, totalling $30.51 billion in asset value, all of which were approved.2Investments from the United States accounted for 60 percent of the total number of investments and totalled $19.86 billion in asset value. Investors from the European Union had the second highest share with 136 investments, totalling $7.41 billion in asset value.3 The ICA applies to all acquisitions of control by a non-Canadian of a Canadian business and to the establishment of new Canadian businesses by non-Canadians . ""Canadian"" is defined as those who are: Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada, governments of Canada and their agencies, and Canadian controlled corporations, partnerships, trusts and joint ventures. ""Non-Canadian"" is defined in the ICA as individuals, governments, government agencies or entities that are not Canadian. The ICA requires all non-Canadians seeking to acquire ""control"" of a Canadian business to file either a post-closing notification (""Notification"") or, if the applicable monetary thresholds relating to the value of the Canadian business are met, a pre-closing application for review (""Application"") with the Investment Review Division. Establishments of new Canadian businesses by non-Canadians are also subject to the ICA, but only a Notification is required. Investments that involve Canadian cultural businesses are dealt with somewhat differently under the ICA. If only a Notification is required for an investment, it must be filed within 30 days of the transaction's closing (or establishment of the new Canadian business). Following receipt of a Notification, the Director of Investments may request additional information or will issue a receipt certifying the date on which the completed notice was received; following which, no further action is required. An Application is a much more extensive regulatory review process, and statutory waiting periods apply before the investment can be completed. The Minister has 45 days from the receipt of an Application to determine whether the proposed investment is ""likely to be of net benefit"" to Canada (""Net Benefit Test""). This period may be extended unilaterally by the Minister for 30 days and for additional periods upon agreement between the Minister and the investor. Foreign investments may also be subject to a separate national security review (""National Security Test"") . The ICA is co-administered by the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Minister of ISEDC (formerly the Minister of Industry) (""Minister"").  The Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for assessing investments in Canada's cultural sector, while the Minister of ISEDC is responsible for assessing investments in all other sectors of the economy. A non-cultural Canadian business being acquired by a private sector WTO investor is measured against an ""enterprise value""4 threshold. Subsections 14.1(1) and (2) of the ICA state the review threshold is $600 million in enterprise value for investments to directly acquire control of a Canadian business. This threshold will increase to $800 million in 2017; and to $1 billion in 2019. Starting January 1, 2021, and for subsequent years, the threshold level will adjust annually based on growth in nominal GDP. Generally, an ""asset-value"" threshold is used for acquisitions involving WTO investors that are State Owned Enterprises (""SOEs""), and non-WTO investors that are  SOEs where the Canadian business that is the subject of the investment is, immediately prior to the implementation of the investment, ""controlled by a WTO investor"". The asset value threshold is annually revised to reflect the change in Canada's nominal GDP, unlike private sector WTO investments, and is $375 million in 2016. This value is calculated with reference to the book value of assets as represented in a company's most recent financial statements. This threshold is further described in section 3.1 of the Investment Canada Regulations5 (""Regulations""). A cultural business is defined in section 14.1(6) of the ICA6 for the purposes of the acquisition of control rules. For a review of a Canadian cultural business, the thresholds are $5 million in book value of assets for direct investments, and $50 million in book value of assets for indirect investments. For an indirect acquisition of a cultural business, where the value of the worldwide assets of the Canadian business exceeds 50 percent of the value of all assets acquired, the review threshold is $5 million in book value of assets. Indirect investments in a cultural business are reviewable on a post-closing basis. If an investment exceeds the Application threshold, the Net Benefit Test becomes relevant. Under section 21 of the ICA, this analysis requires the Minister to consider an Application and any other relevant information or evidence to determine whether or not the investment ""is likely to be of net benefit to Canada"".7 In making this determination, the Minister is required to consider the relevant factors listed in section 20 of the ICA.8 Under the Net Benefit Test, the positive impacts of the investment need only outweigh the negative impacts in order for the investment to be approved. The decision is essentially one of ministerial discretion. Although the Minister is required to make his or her determination within the initial prescribed 45-day period after the receipt of the completed Application, the Minister can, and often does, exercise his or her ability to extend the time for deliberation. According to the 2015-16 Annual Report, the average length of time required by the Minister to make a net benefit determination in 2015-16 was 71.5 days.9 In 2007, Industry Canada released guidelines for state-owned enterprises wishing to invest in Canada (the ""SOE Guidelines"").10 The SOE Guidelines clarified the existing principles under the ICA and underscored that sound principles of corporate governance and commercial orientation would be considerations when reviewing proposed SOE investments under the ICA. It is important to note that even after an investment has been reviewed and has received ""net benefit"" approval, the investment will be subject to continued monitoring. An investor may also be required to give specific undertakings addressing concerns before receiving investment approval, and there can be penalties if these undertakings are not met; see Canada (Attorney General.) v. United States Steel Corporation and U.S. Steel Canada Inc.11 Prior to 2008, over 1,600 transactions were reviewed and no transaction had ever been blocked applying the Net Benefit Test. However, since 2008, there have been a number of instances where high profile deals have been blocked (not including proposed investments that were withdrawn before the Minister reached a decision, or that involved cultural businesses). Examples of three transactions scrutinized under the Net Benefit Test are outlined below.12 Alliant Techsystems & MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. In early 2008 this deal became the first to be rejected under the Net Benefit Test (before the national security jurisdiction was enacted in early 2009). The $1.3 billion deal involved the proposed acquisition of MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates' geospatial division (including Canadarm, Dextre, and the Radarsat-2 satellite) to Minneapolis-based Alliant Techsystems, a major U.S. defence contractor. Media reports suggested that the decision was motivated by concern over losing control of Canadian space technology, including Radarsat 2's ability to monitor threats to Canadian sovereignty, especially in the Arctic.13 BHP Billiton & Potash Saskatchewan In 2010, the Australian company BHP Billiton's (""BHP"") $40 billion hostile takeover bid for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (""Potash"") was blocked . After an Application was submitted to the Minister, in November of 2010, the Minister announced that the bid failed to satisfy the Net Benefit Test pursuant to the ICA.14 Many had been critical of the proposed transaction, including the government of the Province of Saskatchewan which voiced strong objections. CNOOC/Nexen Inc. & Petronas In 2012, the Harper government approved the widely publicized proposed acquisitions of Nexen Inc. by the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (""CNOOC""), and of Progress Energy Resources Corp by Petroliam Nasional Bhd (""Petronas""). In both instances, the proposed investments were found to have met the Net Benefit Test. However, after the approval of these deals, the Harper government adopted a new policy: to grant approval for future similar transactions ""only in exceptional circumstances"".15 The government did not define what these ""exceptional circumstances"" would entail. The government also expressed its concern that ""a series of large-scale controlling transactions by foreign state-owned companies could rapidly transform Canadian natural resource industries. Prime Minister Harper stated at the time: ""when we say that Canada is open for business, we do not mean that Canada is for sale to foreign governments"".""16 In addition to the Net Benefit Test, the ICA contains a standalone National Security Test, which subjects investments by non-Canadians to review by the Governor-in-Council (Federal Cabinet), if they are deemed to be injurious to national security. The National Security Test under the ICA is similar to the process of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (""CFIUS""). Part IV.1 of the ICA governs the National Security Test. The review is usually engaged once a Notification or Application for a net benefit review is submitted. However, any other investment that the Minister considers potentially injurious to national security may also be reviewed. The National Security Test has a broader scope and can capture and examine many more transactions than the net benefit review. Section 25.1 of the ICA permits a review of non-Canadian investments that: No financial threshold is required to be met, and a transaction of any size may be reviewed. If the Minister ""has reasonable grounds to believe"" that an investment could be injurious to national security, the Minister may notify the investor. This notification serves to pause the investment, if it has not yet been implemented, although the investment may still be reviewed post-implementation. If the Minister, independently or jointly with the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, determines that a National Security Test is required, an order will be made and notice of the review will be sent. What constitutes an investment that is injurious to national security is deliberately not defined in the ICA or Regulations in order to preserve the legislation's flexibility. If the investment is not found to be injurious to national security, a notice will be sent indicating the conclusion of the review process. If the investment is found to pose a threat to national security, the Governor in Council may order any measure that is felt to be necessary to mitigate the risks, including those listed in section 25.4 of the ICA, such as; blocking the investment, requiring undertakings or imposing terms and conditions for the implementation, or requiring divestiture of the investment if it has already been made. The Minister has 45 days after the certified date of a Notification or an Application to notify the investor that an order for a National Security Test may be issued. The Minister may notify the investor up to 45 days after the transaction has closed that an order for a National Security Test may be issued. A review under the National Security Test may last up to 200 days, inclusive of all of the interim review periods and the period during which the Governor-in-Council may take action with respect to the investment. This period might be extended even further if the investor and the Minister agree to an extension. Between 2009 and 2016, ISEDC recommended that the Governor-in-Council order eight National Security Tests of investments.17 Among the eight National Security Tests that were conducted, three resulted in directives not to implement the proposed investment, two resulted in orders that the non-Canadian investor divest control of the Canadian businesses; and two resulted in the authorization of the proposed investments subject to conditions to mitigate the associated national security concerns. Finally, one review resulted in the proposed investment being withdrawn prior to the issuance of a final order. Examples of three transactions scrutinized under the National Security Test are outlined below. Accelero/Allstream In this case, Egyptian investment group Accelero Capital Holdings (""Accelero"") applied to acquire Allstream, a business unit of Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (""MTS""). Allstream was valued at $520 million at the time. The Minister pointed to ""unspecified national security concerns"" as the basis for rejecting the deal. The Minister did not specify what the security concerns may have been, but said: ""MTS Allstream operates a national fibre optic network that provides critical telecommunications services to businesses and governments, including the Government of Canada"".18 This was the first expressly disallowed deal under the National Security Test since the creation of the national security regime in 2009. In 2015, MTS's assets were ultimately successfully sold to a non-Canadian investor, US-based Zayo Group Holdings Inc. (""Zayo""), for US$465 million in cash. GFI/Forsys Another deal that raised issues of national security was George Forrest International's (""GFI"") $585 million bid to buy Forsys Metals Corp. (""Forsys"").19 In 2011, Industry Canada (the predecessor to ISEDC) put the transaction on hold due to US suspicions that the Belgian buyers planned to sell Forsys' uranium to Iran. Allegedly, the Canadian government received information that linked GFI to ongoing discussions with Iranian officials and that those discussions may have been related to Iran's efforts to acquire additional uranium ore.20 The deal ultimately fell apart because GFI reportedly missed several deadlines in transferring funds for the takeover, but it is unclear whether it was Industry Canada's intervention that ultimately affected its outcome.21 Beida Jade Bird According to media reports, a proposed investment by Chinese investor, Beida Jade Bird (which is affiliated with China's Peking University), to establish a $30 million alarm manufacturing facility in Saint-Bruno de Montarville, Québec was rejected under the National Security Test. The proposed facility would have placed it near the Canadian Space Agency. The deal was reportedly blocked due to these proximity concerns. This was the first deal in Canada that was rejected due to the proximity of an existing or planned Canadian business to an important government facility. The US has also in the past blocked or reviewed sensitive foreign investments owing to their proximity to military bases, also citing national security concerns.22 In the lead-up to the October 2015 election, many statements by the Liberal party reflected sentiments favouring a more open and transparent foreign investment policy. In April 2015, then-Liberal Finance Critic, Scott Brison, gave a speech to the Canadian Club of Toronto in which he emphasized that a Trudeau government would ""rebuild Canada-China relations that have been diminished by Mr. Harper"".23 Mr. Brison went on to state: Foreign investment including Chinese investment can help create jobs and growth in Canada. Mulroney, Chrétien, and Martin got that, and so does Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau was the first federal leader to endorse the CNOOC-Nexen deal, weeks before Mr. Harper announced federal approval, while muddying the waters, and creating uncertainty for future Chinese investments in Canada. He rejects Mr. Harper's position of making Canada's foreign investment rules deliberately opaque. Mr. Trudeau understands that ambiguous rules might make the Prime Minister's political life a bit easier, but it comes at a cost. That cost is borne by Canadian businesses who are looking for investment, and Canadian workers who need jobs. Ambiguous rules post-CNOOC-Nexen have created a chill on Chinese investment. Chinese investors are as allergic to uncertainty as Canadian investors. […] With a small open economy dependent on trade and investment, Canada needs a Prime Minister who understands how important relationships are to the Canadian economy. In June 2015, Mr. Trudeau himself stated that ""in order to diversify and globalize our approach to trade and foreign investment, we need to do more to strengthen our ties with burgeoning global markets in Asia and Africa, in particular"".24 It still remains unclear whether the Liberal government will propose changes to the ICA that would provide further clarity to the Net Benefit and National Security Tests which would result in more transparent rules and procedures. The statements and comments from the Trudeau government suggest that it will continue its strong history of supporting free trade and openness to foreign investment. In September 2016, Trudeau embarked on a trade mission to China, with the stated hope of creating a renewed investment relationship. In discussing the trip, Finance Minister Bill Morneau stated that Canada may consider relaxing its foreign investment rules, and that the government is open to reviewing the restrictions on the ability of SOEs to acquire Canadian oil assets.25 It is clear that governments around the world are paying attention to what is visibly a trend toward economic protectionism. Yet, given recent announcements by the Liberal government, there appears to be good reason to be hopeful that Canada remains committed to free trade and investment. 1 Unless the investor qualifies for a specific exemption laid out in s. 10 of the ICA. 2 ""Investment Canada Act — Annual Report 2015-2016"", Industry Canada at 1. 3 Ibid. 4 The enterprise value of a public company is calculated as follows: Enterprise Value = Market capitalization plus Liabilities (other than operating liabilities) minus Cash and cash equivalents. The enterprise value of a private company is calculated as follows: Enterprise Value = Total Acquisition Value (""TAV"") plus Liabilities (other than operating liabilities) minus Cash and cash equivalents.

,,Nothing has changed since February except that Canada now really does own the Trans Mountain Pipeline – so keep it public!,"Alberta Politics David Climenhaga's Alberta Politics Blog If the Trans Mountain Pipeline is so essential to the economic wellbeing of Canada and the price of Alberta bitumen is going to rise dramatically as a result of our ability to get that stuff to “tidewater,” why the heck is the federal government, having paid a premium to buy the thing, in such a hurry to unload it? Seriously? I mean, we all know that nowadays all federal parties are lousy with neoliberals who unjustifiably disdain the ability of governments to do things better than profit-motivated private corporations – despite plenty of evidence that this is so. Not only that, but many of us are so propagandized by the relentlessly peddled fantasies of market fundamentalism that the idea of a nation taking on a task of national importance makes us feel hinky. Notwithstanding all that, Ottawa’s new point man on the project, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi, seems to be in an indecent hurry to dump the pipeline project, for which we Canadians have just paid Texas-based Kinder-Morgan Inc. $4.5 billion. If the former Edmonton city councillor appointed to his new federal cabinet post by Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month succeeds with that objective, I’m sorry to have to advise you, we’re all almost certainly going to take a bath, metaphorically speaking. When government spokespeople say they have no interest in hanging onto the thing, even if it’s the government that ends up spending the additional $7-billion plus to complete the expansion project, sharp corporate buyers are bound to smell the blood in the water. So it’s said here it’s time for Mr. Sohi and his fellow Liberals to take a breath and leave the pipeline where it belongs, under direct public ownership, or at least as a Crown corporation, as befits a major national public works program of strategic importance to the national economy. Those of you conditioned to assume this is crazy need to take a breath too. Back in February when I first wrote public ownership was the only way to square the circle of massive opposition to the project on the West Coast and the elite consensus in Edmonton and Ottawa that it must be built, even insiders within Alberta’s NDP government thought I was, if not completely nuts, certainly going over the top for rhetorical effect. So they’ve told me. And yet here we are! Nothing fundamental has changed since I wrote “if an expanded pipeline capable of carrying diluted bitumen from north central Alberta to the West Coast is essential to the health of the national economy, and the survival of Alberta’s, then the federal government should build it and run it.” I argued then that would, or at least could: Plus, if those wonderful predictions about the “Asian premium” are true, it will make money for us all. And without a doubt, handing the pipeline back to the private sector will re-energize the West Coast environmental movement to redouble its efforts to stop the pipeline. That’s because for-profit corporations are simply not capable of putting the needs of Canadians and Canada’s environment before short-term profit. It’s a feature of the capitalist system, not (as they say) a bug. 13 Comments .. I laugh almost hysterically when media says ‘Justin Trudeau bought the pipeline’.. he did not. ‘We bought a pipeline.. yes Canadian taxpayers. As such we need to know if ‘we’ also aquired the liabilities of the entity and any requirements to remediate environmental damage. It seems Albertans and Canadians will end up on the hook to ‘clean up’ the tar sands tailing ponds and any downwind or downstream toxicity thereof. Alberta’s Premier suggested she would to like the province to have a stake in the enterprise ! Including any risks ? The article link below may be a proverbial pail of cold water.. re the rainbow unicorn of opening up the vast Asian markets to Alberta Dilbit. No its not Alberta Oil, nor is is oil, nor is it traditional heavy oil.. it is a synthetic blend approx 30% highly refined diluent mixed with bitumin – a very granular product you could squeeze into a black ‘snowball’ and throw.. Thus we have Dilbit – often quoted as WCS Western Canada Select – Pretending Dilbit is unfairly ‘discounted’ Alberta Oil whose premium value will soar once leaving BC ‘tidewater’ and risking The Hecate Strait, Asia bound. Is that like shipping Alberta beef Sirloin to Asia and it becomes Tenderloin ? Like it transfoms into Brent or West Texas Intermediate ‘benchmark value ? The article may be the best roundup re Dilbit prospects I have come across.. Ms Notely & Justin, Kenney too .. should have a gander. I understand new international rules or laws re fuel for ships are arriving.. which will also have an impact.. these re the various polluting chemicals or levels to be allowed in fuel for shipping. I do hear with proper coking, Dilbit is useful for making asphalt ! Whether that equals Energy Security For Canadians.. or Nation Building, is uncertain though https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/03/07/opinion/fatal-flaw-albertas-oil-expansion “the price of Alberta bitumen is going to rise dramatically as a result of our ability to get that stuff to “tidewater,”” Ya, as basic Econ 101: the increase in supply always results in higher prices* (Sarcasm alert) Great deal for Texas oil barons
bay deal for Canadians taxpayers and all humans on planet Ship solid bitumen bricks by rail, refine at home OR just leave it in the ground … there is plenty of conventional oil around. @Ron: I think the economic argument for shipping bitumen overseas to Asian and other non-US markets, is that the price that is realized for the product might be increased by having more buyers bidding it up. Right now, the only market is the US, which is also a competitor in that same market. Whether this idea bears out or is just a pipe dream (pun intended lol) will be known in the fullness of time, after the pipeline is built and dilbit is flowing. But the rationale is there, and is not at all unreasonable from an economic perspective. What’s preventing the Alberta government from purchasing and owning the pipeline? If the government issued “bonds” to Albertans for a stake in ownership, it could help defray the government’s capital cost of the project. Research reveals “Victory Bonds” and “War Saving Certificates” were successful financial instruments during previous times of war. By providing purchasers of the bonds with a guaranteed yield (a decent ROI), $$$millions could be raised and control of the pipeline would rest in the hands of Albertans. Those dividends could then be paid through profits earned by the pipeline at a later date. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond You argue the case well, David, especially the idea that government owners would be more conscientious about leak prevention. Although some people oppose the pipeline because of the greenhouse emissions of bitumen extraction, opponents most visceral argument is based on leaks. I would love to see a judge, when fining a pipeline company for a leak, direct the company to take the fine out of the shareholders’ dividend, so the shareholders could see what their company has done. With regards to the idea that private ownership is always best, we are starting to see now that privately run driver testing may not have been the good idea we thought it could be. “Possibly even ensure our oil sands activities did not trash our climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and international climate change measures yet to come.” ……”thought I was.. [completely] nuts”. Guess what. “If an expanded pipeline capable … is essential to the health of the national economy, and the survival of Alberta’s…” Unsubstantiated hyperbole.
AB’s oil industry flourished for years without this pipeline expansion (TMX).
The oilsands industry contributed 2.66% of total GDP in 2017 (CERI). Extra revenues from TMX represent a fraction of that.
Subtract externalized environmental and health costs and subsidies.
The oilsands industry is still making money. Suncor reported net income of nearly $1 billion last quarter. As former AB Liberal leader Kevin Taft points out, the AB govt earns more from gaming and alcohol sales than it does from bitumen royalties.
Bitumen royalties make up a mere 3.5% of the total AB budget. Wealth that degrades our life-support systems is illusory. The costs of climate change and fossil-fuel pollution are prohibitive. The oil industry is viable only as long as it externalizes environmental and health costs.

“Plus, if those wonderful predictions about the “Asian premium” are true…”
Why do nearly all tankers out of Vancouver head to U.S. destinations, not Asia?
*
“Possibly even ensure our oil sands activities did not trash our climate commitments under the Paris Agreement”
Non sequitur. How does govt ownership of a pipeline limit oilsands emissions?
Oilsands emissions are grossly under-reported.
AB’s 100+ Mt oilsands emissions cap represents more than two thirds of Canada’s 2050 target (150 Mt).
Add emissions from conventional fossil fuels. And the rest of AB’s emissions. What does that leave for other provinces and industries?
How does pipeline ownership solve any of these problems?
*
“Reassure both British Columbians and Albertans, including Indigenous peoples”
Pipeline spills are inevitable.
Recovery of spills at sea is typically 10-15%. “World-class” oil spill response is meaningless.
Without free, prior, and informed consent, UNDRIP is meaningless. Either we endorse UNDRIP or we do not.
*
“Ensure meaningful financial and environmental accountability”
Govt ownership does not ensure better environmental performance or improve accountability. Expect more bureaucratic intransigence and obfuscation. Govt depts and regulators have been under the thumb of industry for years. Further blurring the line between govt and industry will not help.
Govt is responsible for regulatory oversight and climate action. As a pipeline owner, govt will seek to maximize benefit from pipeline activity, including upstream oilsands operations. Pipeline ownership increases govt dependency on oil revenues, increases an already intractable conflict of interest, and entrenches the petro-state. The “International Marine Organization has announced plans to limit sulphur in bunker fuel by 2020. Bunker fuel is sourced from heavy oil. This regulation would have a dramatic impact on bitumen by lowering the demand for and price of Canada’s heavy crude oil,” as aptly described, and more, again, by Andrew Nikiforuk here:

Perhaps it is no wonder that the feds are in such a hurry to ‘offload” a possible/probable pig-in-a-poke. I think your are right about continuing government ownership is the best approach here, certainly at least until the expansion pipeline is completed. It would look very terrible politically to sell the existing pipeline at a loss to some company making great promises of continuing expansion and then only to have it change its mind a year or two later. Even with that lipstick, David, it’s still a pig! Oh! And for all you serious bloggers out there? Please at least allow your suffering fans the ability to edit their posts. Your are our favourite sites after all! https://youtu.be/ZQgYn23Xvck The feds bought an existing TM pipeline that still is delivering conventional oil to Burnaby and, mostly, refineries in Washington state. Left on its own it will eventually pay for itself. Not so plain is the amount of investment required to make shipping dilbit—the stuff proposed for the TMX pipeline yet to be built—through the busy, island-studded inside waters of two nations absolutely failsafe. We’ve heard a figure, $1.5 billion, quoted as contributory to making dilbit supertanker traffic failsafe, but have no idea if it will be spent on more of the same, proven inadequate conventional oil spill responses, or on some kind of as-yet described new systems to deal with the much more difficult dilbit spill; neither have we seen commitments to have these as-yet (I suspect) untested technologies in place before dilbit shipping commences at a rate seven fold the current rate for conventional oil shipping. What we have heard is equivocation about Victoria dumping raw sewage into Juan de Fuca Strait (the city is currently building a massively expensive and disruptive sewage treatment system) or that lots of ships already spill fuel and oil into these inside waters—so, I guess, it’s supposed to make adding a significantly higher risk better? But never mind all that for now: the TMX pipeline is yet to be built and that will run smack into Aboriginal Rights and Title, post-“Tsihlqot’in” SCoC decision. How much will these court challenges, win or lose, add to the cost of building TMX? Finally, there is no magic Asian sugar daddy committed to paying a premium for petroleum’s lowest grade product. Shouldn’t we know at least how much shipped dilbit will sell for before we invest in TMX? Shouldn’t we know what the cost of First Nation and BC provincial litigation might cost the TMX project will be? What’s the hurry? The existing TM pipeline is still making money right now without doing another thing. I would assume there would be no sale until the taxpayer has paid for finishing the project. That said if we had a functioning media and journalists in this country the fact that our finance minister owns a company that makes rather large sums of money advising pension funds would be front and centre. How much will he personally gain when this thing is sold off? Then again no one seemed to care when the CRA gave a sweet deal to tax avoiders who happened to be clients of the accounting firm that audits his companies books.

,,Paul Wells," In his annual interview with The Star’s Susan Delacourt, Justin Trudeau said Volodymyr Zelensky is “certainly aware” that “the Canadian Parliament is no longer unequivocally and unanimously standing with Ukraine because of decisions Pierre Poilievre has taken.” I have so many thoughts. I’m reminded of the Rouleau commission of inquiry into the Freedom Convoy, when a telephone conversation between Trudeau and Ottawa’s then-mayor Jim Watson revealed that Trudeau enjoys fielding difficult questions about his own behaviour by snitching on third parties. “It’s important that the federal government live up to its commitment,” Watson says. “Doug Ford has been hiding from his responsibility on it for political reasons as you highlighted,” Trudeau responds. This is why God created the chef’s kiss emoji. It is, however, true that the Conservatives have voted against a revised free-trade deal with Ukraine that essentially says the two countries will be free to talk about carbon taxes if they both ever feel like it. And when Pierre Poilievre forced the Commons through a million money votes as part of a theatre piece he conceived on the theme of his opposition to carbon taxes, one of the measures they voted against included funding for Op Unifier, the Canadian training mission for Ukrainian soldiers. These votes caused the Ukrainian Canadian Congress to express alarm, not once but repeatedly over several days. And it’s becoming clear that the votes have become part of the Liberals’ claim that the Conservatives can’t be trusted to uphold Canadian values. Already in November, with the president of the European Commission sitting next to him, Trudeau said the votes were proof that the Conservatives had taken up full-time residence in Donald Trump’s fun-land. “The real story is the rise of a right-wing, American MAGA-influenced thinking that has made Canadian Conservatives — who used to be among the strongest defenders of Ukraine, I'll admit it — turn their backs on something Ukraine needs in its hour of need,” Trudeau said then.

,,Remember when? Alberta’s economy under Trudeau (Sr.)," October 6, 20157:15 AM James Rose147 Comments “If my voice is trembling, it’s because I am terribly angry, to the point where I would be happy to fight for our freedom and I literally mean with a rifle.” “Let the Eastern bastards freeze in the dark!” Very strong language, most will agree. The above quotes effectively illustrate the emotions felt by a majority of Albertans directed towards the Pierre Trudeau led federal government of the early 1980’s. The emotional outcry, of course, was in the wake of Trudeau’s infamous 1980 National Energy Policy. The first quote came from an Albertan who called in to a radio station to voice displeasure and outrage with Trudeau’s policy. The latter was a phrase all too popular among the bumpers of many an Albertan car. Ultimately, the political trauma induced by the wayward energy policy set off a generation of political bitterness. Albertans felt Trudeau couldn’t care less about their welfare. He mocked then Alberta premier, Peter Lougheed, saying Lougheed had been outsmarted by multinational oil firms. As Kevin Libin recently reported for the National Post, “Keith Davey, the Liberals’ campaign strategist, put it bluntly during the Liberals’ 1980 federal election: ‘Screw the West, we’ll take the rest.’” The National Energy Program, largely the brainchild of Trudeau’s energy minister Marc Lalonde, sought more federal control over the energy industry. The impetus for such goals came in the wake of the extremely volatile oil price climate throughout the 1970’s. It had three main goals: increase the federal share of energy revenues, boost Canadian ownership in the oil industry, and make Canada self-sufficient as an oil producer. The Trudeau government also introduced a tax to finance the federally owned energy company Petro-Canada, and gave grants to Canadian-owned companies to encourage exploration. The Program was promoted as an effort to counter the prevalence of rising world oil prices ($1.80 a barrel in 1970, oil hit $30 by 1980), and the unpredictably wild price swings of 1972, and 1979. Trudeau argued the NEP would pave the way for Canada to become self-sufficient in energy. How so? By forcing Albertan producers to sell domestically at a deep discount to world prices and allowing Petro-Canada an advantage in purchasing producing assets. Self-sufficiency would protect Canada from the volatility of the international oil prices so the logic went. Furthermore, Eastern Canadians would then be able to buy oil at below-market rates, and the federal government would have a view into an industry dominated by foreign owned petroleum companies. Economic disaster quickly followed. Alberta’s unemployment rate shot from 4% to more than 10%. Bankruptcies soared 150%. A housing crisis ensued resulting in values collapsing 40% in both Edmonton and Calgary. As Libin notes, “it would take office landlords a decade to work off the glut.” Alberta’s government plunged into significant debt levels. Ted Byfield, founder of the now defunct Alberta Report, was quoted as saying “there was an enormous amount of pain everywhere, Alberta was very much a small-business province. Behind the big oil companies, there were thousands of little people..all this was just brought to a crashing halt.” Former premier Ralph Klein, who was mayor of Calgary at the time, said “thousands of people lost their jobs, their homes, their businesses, their dignity. Some took their own lives.” Energy minister Marc Lalonde later said the motive was what Albertans had suspected all along: “to transfer wealth from Alberta to Central Canada. The major factor behind the NEP wasn’t Canadianization or getting more from the industry or even self-sufficiency. The determinant factor was the fiscal imbalance between the provinces and the federal government,” Lalonde added. “Our proposal was to increase Ottawa’s share appreciably, so that the share of the producing provinces would decline significantly and the industry’s share would decline somewhat.” In effect, the NEP gutted the Alberta energy sector and jeopardized the country’s energy future. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers later blamed the NEP for the loss of 15,000 jobs, a 22% drop in drilling activity, and a 25% decline in exploration budgets. Overall, industry cash flow and earnings fell 34% to $3.1 billion in 1981 from $4.7 billion a year before. As oil patch historian Paul Chastko notes, “the price paid by consumers of petroleum products almost doubled as consumption dropped by 6%. The industry realized far too late that the energy struggles between the province and the federal government had little to do with oil and everything to do with political power.” Chastko adds, “the NEP decimated the oil and gas industry after Lalonde designed the NEP to alter the structure of power between Ottawa and the industry, between Ottawa and foreign owned energy companies, and between Ottawa and Alberta.” Economists later said that ultimately, the NEP cost the Alberta provincial economy more than $97 billion. Albertans have long memories. The last liberal MP to be elected in the city of Calgary was Pat Mahoney. The year? 1968. With ever changing demographics and the sifting sands of time, will Alberta forgive, in the upcoming federal election, the long tarnished Liberal brand? Will Albertans help elect the son of the man who did so much to damage Albertan prosperity? In politics, stranger things have happened. After all, did anyone in Canada think Rachel Notley and the Alberta NDP had a chance?

,,LNG Canada project formally signed into reality,"  The $40 billion LNG Canada project, formally sanctioned at a signing ceremony in Vancouver Tuesday October 2, represents “the single largest private sector investment in the history of Canada,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. See also: LNG Canada project is a go And in case anyone missed it, Trudeau repeated the phrase three more times. B.C. Premier John Horgan repeated it twice. The long-awaited “unconditional” final investment decision on the liquefied natural gas plant in Kitimat and Coastal GasLink natural gas pipeline was announced late Monday night. Executives from LNG Canada’s five joint venture partners – Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas, PetroChina, Mitsubishi and Korea Gas – were on hand to officially sign a final investment decision agreement at a press conference in Vancouver Tuesday. “LNG Canada is immediately today moving into construction,” said LNG Canada CEO Andy Calitz. The announcement of LNG Canada getting a final investment decision marks two back-to-back wins for Trudeau, whose government just yesterday successfully inked a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. “Similar to our great news on trade yesterday, today is a great day,” Trudeau said. The FID is a win for the Horgan government, as well, which has been characterized as chasing away large energy projects, like the Pacific NorthWest LNG project, which was cancelled not long after NDP government took power. “It validates the reality that, in B.C., projects can be done if it is done in the right way,” Calitz said. In a show of non-partisan unity, Liberal Party Leader Andrew Wilkinson, Liberal MLA Ellis Ross and former Liberal Natural Gas minister Rich Coleman were invited to Tuesday’s signing ceremony, and Horgan singled out Coleman and Ross for their efforts to develop an LNG industry in B.C. “In recent years, Rich Coleman worked tirelessly to get a final investment decision here in British Columbia,” Horgan said. “This is not about one government.  This is not about one person. This is about a commitment from the people of British Columbia, to our resources, and to do what we can to make life better for British Columbia.” Special credit was also given to the Haisla First Nation for its strong support for the LNG industry. Haisla Chief Crystal Smith said her people’s involvement in the project means that “we are having a share and we are having a say.” The project will result in $23 billion in spending in B.C., and generate roughly 10,000 construction jobs over a five-year period. The plant is expected to be completed around 2025. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver, who was not at Tuesday’s ceremony, has said he cannot support the project, and has stated he does not think that B.C. can meet its climate change commitments while developing an LNG industry. Asked about Weaver’s opposition, Horgan said: “He has some concerns about this project. I do not.” “The challenge now for the prime minister and I, and all policy makers, is to ensure that we can fit the emission profile of this project within a robust and aggressive climate action plan that will meet not just the needs of British Columbians but, in fact, the world, and I believe we can do that,” Horgan said. Trudeau said that the LNG Canada plant will have “the lowest carbon intensity of any large scale facility in the world.” And because natural gas produces about half the carbon emissions that coal does, exporting LNG to displace coal power means there is a net benefit, Trudeau said. “By sending Canadian LNG to markets that are today powered by coal we will help those jurisdictions transition out away from this energy source,” Trudeau said. nbennett@biv.com

,,The People’s Pipeline,"ADVERTISEMENT Andrea Levy / September 6, 2018 / 4 min read ENVIRONMENT Photo by SumOfUs In an era of neoliberal privatization when governments the world over are hastening to sell off state owned assets and public services for a mess of pottage, Justin Trudeau bucks the trend by ponying up $4.5 billion to buy the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline, with complete disregard for the resolute opposition by the B.C. government, many Indigenous groups, most environmentalists and thousands of citizens across the country deeply worried about the ecological impact and risks of both the pipeline expansion and the ensuing escalation of tanker traffic. You might think this was some unexpected throwback to a politics of economic nationalism of the kind Trudeau’s father embraced in the 1970s when the Liberals and the NDP teamed up to create Petro- Canada. But the actual motives look even sketchier. And the timing seems that much stranger in light of the Liberals’ decision to sink $35 billion into the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a scheme purportedly intended to attract private investors to big new revenue-generating (read user fees) infrastructure projects, but which looks to be laying the groundwork for the privatization, by the back door, of existing infrastructure from airports to hospitals. So why the missed beat in the rhythm with Kinder Morgan? One rationalization we can rule out is the Trudeau government’s cake-and-eat-it line that pipelines carrying diluted bitumen from what the Environmental Defence organization dubbed the most environmentally destructive project on Earth are vital to fund the fight against climate change. It’s reminiscent of Ronald Reagan building missiles for peace. In fact, as sustainable energy expert Mark Jaccard observed (Globe and Mail, February 20, 2018), Trudeau knows full well that spurring further development of the tar sands with pipeline expansions guarantees Canada’s failure to meet its greenhouse gas emission reduction targets under the Paris Accord. Bruce Livesey has speculated (The Guardian, May 31, 2018) that the Kinder Morgan pipeline purchase was designed to avert a lawsuit by Chinese corporations under the Investor State Arbitration clause of the Canada-China Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. Negotiated under Harper and ratified with the support of Trudeau’s Liberals, the treaty contained a promise to have a pipeline built from Alberta to B.C. Trudeau, Livesey suggests, is “desperate to keep China happy,” presumably due to his hopes of a Canada-China free trade agreement. Still, the price of the pipeline combined with the cost of actually building it ($6.9 billion according to a Financial Post estimate) adds up to over $11 billion. That’s a hefty price tag for a safeguard against being sued, especially when you factor in the costs of cleaning up potentially devastating dilbit spills. Another explanation is that the pipeline purchase is the federal Liberals’ bid to placate Alberta and secure support for Ottawa’s carbon-pricing plan — a plan that Ottawa recently downgraded to appease industry. No doubt Rachel Notley wants the pipeline expansion built; her political future likely depends on it. But does the fate of an NDP Premier weigh that heavily on the will of the Trudeau Liberals, even at the risk of alienating BC Premier Horgan? Of course, the Trudeau government’s stated intention, on the “if you build it they will come” logic, is to land private investors. Possible takers range from an Indigenous consortium to Kinder Morgan itself – the latter having kindly been relieved of risk by Canadian taxpayers as a result of the government’s decision to indemnify buyers against any losses incurred due to determined and persistent resistance to the project, doubtless including the many legal challenges, like those brought by a number of Indigenous communities on the grounds that they have neither consented to the Trans Mountain expansion nor been meaningfully consulted. So the question remains cui bono? Not the taxpayers liable for billions in possible losses. Not the Indigenous nations whose land and water stand to be irreparably despoiled by a serious spill. Not B.C. coastal residents. Not menaced marine life. Not construction workers who will gain only a few thousand (mainly temporary) jobs, contrary to the inflated figures originally floated. Not even the Canadian economy in the long run since, as Howard Mann and Aaron Cosbey aptly argue (ipolitics.ca, April 15, 2018), excessive dependence on fossil fuel exports is ultimately a doomed proposition. And certainly not future generations of humans and other species who will pay the price for climate chaos accelerated by the exploitation of the Alberta tar sands. The only winners in this toxic transaction are the Kinder Morgan executives who are unloading a pipeline that was proving inexpedient for a tidy profit (a return of no less than637 per cent according to one report), along with the assorted domestic and foreign firms mortgaging the Earth to profit from dirty oil.

Trudeau, in Sudbury, Ont., to make an infrastructure announcement, said he has been fully open with Canadians about the investments he holds. The prime minister was unequivocal when asked directly whether he or any of his family members hold cash or investments in offshore accounts. ""No, we do not,"" Trudeau said as some in the audience chuckled. ""I have been entirely and completely transparent about my and my family's finances."" Trudeau said the Panama Papers have highlighted the concerns that people around the world have about political leaders and other powerful corporate figures using offshore accounts and tax havens to avoid paying taxes. And he pointed to measures announced in his government's first fiscal plan as proof that he is determined to find tax cheats. ""In this budget, even before the Panama Papers came out, we had allocated an extra $440 million to the Canada Revenue Agency to ensure they are empowered to go after tax avoidance,"" Trudeau said. Canadians expect their leaders to show they are worthy of their trust, while leaders need to trust Canadians enough to share details about the assets they hold, Trudeau said without directly mentioning anyone implicated in the scandal. A massive leak of more than 11 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca -- one of the world's largest creators of shell companies -- has been dogging political leaders around the world. The unprecedented leak of details about assets being held in tax-sheltered offshore accounts had one of Canada's biggest lenders, the Royal Bank, on the defensive this week over its ties to the law firm. Media reports have linked hundreds of wealthy Canadians to the controversy. While in Sudbury, Trudeau announced federal funding to match a $26.7 million Ontario government commitment to an $80-million road construction project in the mining town. Sudbury was among the first stops Trudeau made as last year's federal election campaign was ramping up, during which he made promises that included $200 million for the mining and forest sectors. His government's first budget last month included $87.2 million for a wide range of research projects in forestry, mining and minerals, earth sciences and mapping, and innovation in energy technology. But the budget has been criticized by some -- including some of the Liberal government's own members, sources say -- for a lack of support for the forestry sector. While mining and other resource companies haven't garnered the national headlines the oil sector has been capturing of late, the sluggish international economy and a collapse in commodity prices has also left them reeling. Sudbury Mayor Brian Bigger isn't among those being critical of the federal budget. In fact, it is in sync with the city's need to grow and diversify, Bigger said. ""One thing that's very gratifying is how closely the budget aligns with the types of things we're looking for, like the investment in infrastructure or affordable housing."" During last year's election campaign, Trudeau also promised to work with the Ontario government to bring resources to market from a vast stretch of territory known as the Ring of Fire -- a region once dubbed by former federal Conservative cabinet minister Tony Clement as the oilsands of Ontario. The Ring of Fire is a huge mineral deposit of chromite, nickel, gold, copper and platinum discovered in 2007, 500 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay. ""Things are sort of grinding forward in the right way,"" said Alan Coutts, president and CEO of Noront Resources, which has been pushing for development in the region to start moving forward. ""At some point in time, you just have to say, ""Right, now here's what we're proposing to do.'"" Coutts said that by mid-year, the company expects to see a ""holistic"" plan for developing the resource. Trudeau would only say that he expects to make announcements ""in the coming months"" about the Ring of Fire.

,,PHYLLIS ENTIS,"July 26, 2022 by Phyllis Entis 11 Comments On December 17, 2019, Petro-Canada marked the completion of its “Electric Highway,” a network of more than 40 high-speed charging stations strung along the Trans-Canada Highway from Vancouver Island to Nova Scotia. The network was advertised as being accessible either via a dedicated Petro-Canada phone app or directly by credit card using a card reader installed on each charger. The project received $4.6 million in funding from the Canadian government. In his remarks during the ceremony marking the opening of the final charging station in the chain, Wilf Steimle, president of the Electric Vehicle Society, said, “for the electric car owners in Canada, this means they can now travel from coast-to-coast as quickly and conveniently as they would have in a traditional car.” This summer, we put that promise–and Petro-Canda–to the test. We left Victoria, British Columbia, on June 15th, and arrived in Ottawa, Ontario, on June 22nd. Knowing that we would be making more, and longer, stops to charge our Volvo XC40 Recharge than would have been the case for a conventionally powered vehicle, we allowed for two hours of charging time daily, based on an anticipated four stops of approximately thirty minutes each. In reality, most of our stops required close to one full hour to achieve our targeted 80% battery charge. This was due in large part to the failure of Petro-Canada’s EV charging stations at several stops across the country. Instead of enjoying the efficiency of a Petro-Canda “fast charge,” we often found ourselves having to hunt for a less efficient–but functioning–charging station. From Ottawa, we traveled to Montréal, Knowlton, Peterborough and Newmarket (north of Toronto), before embarking on our return trip. We left Newmarket on July 2nd, and arrived back in Victoria on July 9th. This is a day-by-day report of our Petro-Canada experiences. We planned to charge up at the Petro-Canada EV stations in Abbotsford and Hope. The Abbotsford station functioned as anticipated. The Hope EV station was out of service. We used BC Hydro charging stations for the rest of the day, arriving at our hotel in Salmon Arm after 9:00pm, tired, frustrated, and hungry. We used the Petro-Canada EV stations in Golden, BC and Canmore, Alberta. Both of them worked as promised. We relied on BC Hydro and FLO network stations for our other charging stops, as they were located more conveniently along the route. There are few EV charging network alternatives across Alberta and Saskatchewan. We stopped at the Petro-Canada charging stations in Medicine Hat, Swift Current, Moose Jaw, and Regina. The Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, EV charger was not in service. We limped into Regina far behind schedule, and stopped there for the night, more than 200 kilometers short of our goal. Once again, we had no choice but to rely principally on Petro-Canada for our charging stops. Our first two stops–in Whitewood, Saskatchewan, and Brandon, Manitoba–were uneventful. Then, disaster struck. The Petro-Canada EV charger in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba was not in service. The Petro-Canada EV charger in Dugald, Manitoba (just east of Winnipeg) was not in service. We crawled into Kenora after 9pm, with our battery nearing empty. After checking into our Comfort Inn, we went in search of the Petro-Canada EV chargers. The Kenora EV chargers were not just out of service. They were under water. After our disastrous experience (and near-stranding) the day before, we avoided even attempting to use a Petro-Canada EV charger between Kenora and Thunder Bay. Instead, we relied on Ontario’s Ivy charging network, which worked flawlessly. We gave Petro-Canada another chance on this leg of our journey, stopping to charge the car at the company’s stations in Nipigon, Marathon, and Wawa. Although the credit card reader was not working at the Nipigon charging stop, we were able to charge successfully, thanks to an unusually helpful customer service phone rep (more about Petro-Canada’s “help” line later). We used two Petro-Canada stations, one in Sault Ste.-Marie and the other in Sudbury. Both functioned correctly. We did not use a Petro-Canada EV station on this final leg of our eastbound journey. We stopped in Sudbury to use the Petro-Canada EV charger. It worked correctly. According to the Petro-Canada phone app, one of the two Sault Ste.-Marie charging stations was out of service. We chose to charge at an Ivy location instead. The card reader on one of the two Wawa EV chargers was not working, and Petro-Canada’s customer service was unhelpful. Fortunately, the reader worked correctly on the second charger. We charged the car successfully at Petro-Canada stations in both Nipigon and Thunder Bay. The Dugald, Manitoba, Petro-Canada EV chargers were not in service, even though the phone app indicated both chargers as available. The Petro-Canada phone app indicated that the Portage la Prairie chargers were unavailable, so we bypassed that stop and headed directly to Brandon, which was indicated to be functioning. The Whitewood EV chargers were not working, even though the Petro-Canada phone app reported them to be available. The Regina EV chargers did not work. Again, the Petro-Canada phone app showed them to be available. The Moose Jaw EV chargers were down for maintenance, even though the Petro-Canada phone app indicated them to be available. The Swift Current Petro-Canada EV charger could be activated by the phone app, but not by the card reader. The Petro-Canada charger in Medicine Hat was not available. We avoided using Petro-Canada EV chargers, relying instead on Electrify Canada chargers, which worked flawlessly. We avoided using Petro-Canada EV chargers, relying instead on Electrify Canada chargers, which worked flawlessly. On our eastbound trip, we attempted to charge our car at sixteen Petro-Canada locations. Ten of the sixteen attempts met with complete success, which we defined as both the charging station and the card reader performing as specified. Five of the charging stops were complete failures. At one location, the EV charger was functioning, but the card reader did not work. On our westbound (return) trip, we attempted to charge the car at twelve Petro-Canada locations. We were completely successful at only three of those stops: Sudbury, Nipigon, and Thunder Bay. At seven of the locations, the charging stations were not functioning at all, even though some of those charging stations were being reported as “available” by the Petro-Canada phone app. At two locations, the charging stations were functional, but their card readers did not work. Overall, our success rate was a pitiful 46% (thirteen out of twenty-eight stops). Unlike other EV networks we encountered, Petro-Canada does NOT have a customer service number dedicated to EV-charging issues. Instead, the toll-free number posted on each Petro-Canada charging station feeds into the company’s main automated answering system. To access EV help, the caller must listen to a long list of options. EV-related customer service is the fifth option on the list. Once through to EV help, there was usually a wait of several minutes until a customer service rep responded to the call. And that response was completely unhelpful in most cases. During one memorable attempt to use customer service when a card reader wasn’t working, the rep asked me for the postal code of the Petro-Canada station I was calling from. This despite each individual EV charging unit having its own unique alphanumeric identification code. After several frustrating minutes, during which I was trying to have the rep authorize our credit card over the telephone (which we had done successfully previously), I was told that he would have to send a email request to another agent in order to do so. On another occasion, after spending some fifteen minutes explaining to the customer service rep what our problem was, that rep simply passed us to a different rep, who had to hear the story all over again. On July 13, 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a deal to build a $1.5 billion EV battery plant in eastern Ontario. Both the federal and the Ontario governments have agreed to contribute funding for the construction of the facility. That same day, Shell Canada announced plans to expand its network of Level 3 EV charging stations, adding 79 stations at 37 Shell retail locations by the end of 2022. The company hopes to expand the availability of its fast chargers to more than 500 by 2025. Canada has made–and is continuing to make–a major investment in support of a cross-Canada rapid EV-charging network, in order to facilitate the nation’s conversion to electric vehicles. This effort is being very poorly served by the abysmal performance of Petro-Canada’s EV network, including its customer support system. The failures we encountered in the Petro-Canada system were at their most frequent exactly where they were most needed–in the prairie provinces and northwestern Ontario, where other charging options were limited. The performance of Petro-Canada’s EV charging system was not only frustrating and stressful, but it was also a complete embarrassment to this Canadian. Worse, Petro-Canada’s poor performance harms Canada’s image as a climate-conscious, green-energy country in the eyes of visitors who embark on a Canadian road trip in the expectation that Level 3 EV chargers will be available and reliable. We can, and must, do better. You can read about our cross-country adventures in my four-part series, A long and winding road.

Liked by 1 person Categories: EV travel | Tags: EV charging, Petro-Canada | Permalink. Leave a comment Sad and unfortunate. I am curious about the cost of your charges when they did work!! How would they compare to a gasoline charge? So sad that we are not moving any faster on EVs and better batteries with longer ranges. I will not go EV at this point, but looking at hybrids. Liked by 1 person We were disappointed in the uneven EV charging performance, as you can tell from my posts. The one bright spot was the cost. The EV chargers operate on a cost-per-minute bases (versus cost-per-kw), and they tend to be in the $20-$27 per hour, depending on what province they are located in (British Columbia is a bit less expensive than some of the other provinces). I don’t think we spent more than ~$25 on a single “fill-up” and many of them were in the $15-$20 range. This depended, of course, on what our battery level was at the time we plugged in. Like Hi, it is really dependent on the speed of the charge. Some cars like the Ioniq 5 can charge from 10 to 80% state of charge in 18 minutes. at .45 cents a minute that is 8.10$ + tx. Pretty affordable BUT the issue with the Petro-Canada network is that it will often provide power rates less than what the car is expecting and making the charging time longer then needed, increasing cost. I have seen 60 kWh on a 350 kWh charger and that is 3x more expensive then my example for the same charge. Don’t know why some chargers are advertising 350 kWh and only delivering 60 kWh, but sadly that is the state of Petro-Canada’s network, very unpredictable and unreliable. Liked by 1 person We didn’t keep careful track of our costs. I would say most of our charges were in the $15-$25 range across all of the networks. Like Well I would not use this “Trek” as the reference. Circuit electric, Flo, Ivy (Ontario), charge point and Electrify Canada have decent to very very well maintained stations. To have owned an EV for the last 8 years ( yep already) Petro-Canada is the exception. Liked by 1 person I agree. Petro-Canada is the sad exception to a system that is functioning well, although still “thin on the ground” in some provinces. Like We have tried in the east, Quebec and New-Brunswick some stations from Petro-Canada and had very similar experiences. Not functioning stations , app reporting error, charging speed below capable level sometime topping at 60 kWh when expecting 200+ on my Ioniq 5. Now, I try to avoid them. Liked by 2 people Phyllis thank you so much for documenting this. I have often wondered when trekking back and forth how well the ev chargers work in some of the more remote locations. I also noticed that you had to use an app, when there were places along the way that we couldn’t get cell signals! You must be a great planner! Great post! Liked by 1 person We did a lot of advance planning, but still didn’t anticipate all of the eventualities (especially the Petro-Canada issues). Some apps worked better than others. The BC Hydro app and Ivy app both worked reliably. The FLO app was more flaky. As for Petro-Can’t, we quickly learned that we could not rely on the availability info on their app for individual locations. Too often, the app indicated a station was available for use, but when we arrived, the unit was down for maintenance or simply offered a blank screen. Most frustrating and stressful. Like I have had an EV for a little over a year now. Petro Canada EV chargers are simply horrible. I am estimating a success rate of charging to be 20 percent of the time it works, 80 percent failure rate. I will not even stop at a Petro Can charger if any other option is available. If you can’t fix the charging units get out of the game! Liked by 1 person Fortunately, the number of other options is increasing.

,,Terry Glavin: Justin Trudeau went all in on China a decade ago — and nothing can shake his resolve,"Justin Trudeau has been singularly focused on trade with China, regardless of what the country's sadistic leadership does In the way the story’s usually told, relations between Canada and China are said to be at the lowest point in decades, or at an all-time low, or chillier than ever. But any close examination of the relationship will show that what these expressions more precisely describe is an ongoing, abject humiliation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government by China’s capricious and sadistic supreme ruler, Xi Jinping.     It’s been a very public humiliation, too. It began well before Xi’s Ministry of State Security kidnapped and imprisoned the diplomat-on-leave Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor in December, 2018, to punish Canada for having detained one of the Chinese Communist Party’s elite untouchables on a U.S. extradition request. While the Michaels were being held incommunicado in Chinese prison cells, the Huawei Technologies Company chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was in the media spotlight, enjoying a lavish lifestyle in one of her Vancouver mansions while her case proceeded through the courts. It’s only now, after all this time, that Meng is availing herself of a kind of plea bargain with the U.S. Justice Department — an option that has been available to her all along. Friday night, she and both Spavor and Kovrig were on their way home, but the underlying concerns remain. No matter how far the “relationship” drags Canada away from its traditional allies and Five Eyes intelligence partners, Ottawa’s singular focus has been on avoiding hard questions, keeping quiet and hoping nobody notices. While Beijing’s ratings in Canadian public opinion polls have continued to plummet year after year, the Trudeau government’s main worry hasn’t been about the outrages against international norms that were causing Canadians to take such a dim view of the Xi regime. Its main worry was that Beijing’s behaviour was harming the “relationship.” It’s confounding, but it’s got nothing to do with avoiding any indiscretion that could complicate the delicate negotiations surrounding the release of the Canadians that Beijing has been holding hostage. A lot of it has to do with the influences of the Liberal party’s old guard and its close and lucrative ties to corporate interests that are deeply invested in trade relations with China. But it’s mainly about a whole-of-government organizing principle that Trudeau decided to stake his reputation on a decade ago, a big idea about the Canadian economy, foreign policy and global trade. After everything that has happened since then that has proved the idea’s catastrophic folly, Trudeau has never taken pains to reverse its course. It was a full year before the two Michaels were picked up in China that Trudeau was dismissed from Beijing like an amorous suitor with rather too high an opinion of his prospects. Trudeau and his entourage arrived in China in December 2017, in a whirlwind of excitement about formalizing an engagement for an eventual exchange of vows in a free trade agreement. Trudeau had come fully expecting that the arrangement should reflect his “progressive” agenda. He was rebuffed, and Trudeau’s Chinese hosts sent him away. This newsletter tackles hot topics with boldness, verve and wit. (Subscriber-exclusive edition on Fridays)    But the thing to notice in all this is how Canada ended up so dangerously exposed to Beijing’s strong-arm exertions in the first place. It goes back a decade, and to be fair, what Trudeau and his closest advisers launched back then was like one of those massive, deep-hulled container ships — not the kind of thing, to borrow a phrase, that you can just “turn on a dime.” That ship left port a long time ago. It’s been barrelling across the sea ever since. The inflection point in Canada’s subjugation by Beijing came within a week of Nov. 14, 2012, the official start of the race to succeed Michael Ignatieff as Liberal leader. The year before, Prime Minister Stephen Harper had won his first Conservative majority government and the NDP’s Jack Layton was the official Opposition leader. With the Liberals left in third place in the House of Commons, Trudeau joined the race for the party leadership and invested his credibility in a big idea: China is the future. While Harper’s vision was to establish Canada as a “global energy superpower,” which would shift the centre of Canada’s political gravity westward, Trudeau’s was just as straightforward: Beijing’s promise of a win-win relationship would unlock untold riches for Canada’s middle class. The power would not shift westward, but would rather entrench itself in the Liberal party’s bastions within the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto triangle. Armed with growth forecasts and statistical projections helpfully provided by McKinsey & Company — the global consulting firm whose managing director, Dominic Barton, would go on to play a more public role later in the drama — Trudeau laid out his case in a widely published manifesto within days of declaring his candidacy. “China is scanning the world for acquisitions like a shopper in a grocery store,” Trudeau wrote. “Just a decade ago, China’s outward foreign direct investment was negligible; today it approaches $100 billion. Canada has perhaps more potential to capitalize on this context than any other country. From minerals to energy, from education expertise to construction, we have a lot of what China needs.” This was supposed to distinguish Trudeau in the field of Liberal leadership candidates. He was determined to be seen as something more than just an unserious and cossetted high-society grandee, and his big China idea was the way to do it. The idea buttressed the sanctity around the legacy of his father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, who had been so beguiled by Mao Zedong that he went on to play a key role in the normalization of the People’s Republic of China in the international community. Trudeau the elder was remembered fondly and appreciatively in the salons of China’s Communist party elites, so if anyone was going to animate the symbiosis of the Canadian and Chinese economies and tap into all those markets and all that money, it would have to be Justin Trudeau. Explaining himself on CTV’s “Question Period” two weeks after his manifesto made the rounds, Trudeau said he trusted his own instincts, adding, “Obviously, my family has historical ties with China.” It helped, too, that the idea was already bred in the bone in his father’s circle — the old Liberal-dominated network of trade lobbyists and corporate deal-makers with ties to the Desmarais family’s Power Corporation. Jean Chrétien, the Liberal prime minister who led several “Team Canada” missions to China and played a critical role in rehabilitating the regime in the boardrooms of the world after its slaughter of students and pro-democracy activists in Tiananmen Square in 1989, had been busily plying the China trade ever since his resignation following the 2003 sponsorship scandal. Chrétien’s son-in-law, Andre Desmarais, is honorary chairman of the Canada-China Business Council (CCBC). Even before he settled in at the Prime Minister’s Office after winning the Liberals a majority government in October 2015, Trudeau appointed Peter Harder, head of the CCBC, to lead his transition team. Trudeau later saw to it that Harder was given the Liberals’ top seat in the Senate. Former immigration minister John McCallum raised eyebrows by taking $73,000 in free trips to China before his appointment as ambassador to China. When McCallum ended up having to be relieved of his duties for issuing embarrassing declarations endorsing Meng’s legal complaints about her detention in Canada, he was replaced by McKinsey’s Dominic Barton, who had been so helpful in developing Trudeau’s China proposals in 2012. But even before he was appointed Canada’s ambassador to China, Barton was already occupying a top spot in the Liberal brain trust as chair of Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s blue-chip advisory council on economic growth. Barton had spent years in China, where McKinsey had advised a company involved in the construction of illegal islands in the South China Sea, and drew unwanted attention to itself by holding a corporate retreat in Xinjiang, within walking distance of a Uyghur concentration camp. Barton’s place in Morneau’s council was so central that the council itself was almost totally a McKinsey show. The council didn’t even have its own budget. McKinsey handled its administration, supplied consultants and provided all the research and analysis for free. Meanwhile, with Stéphane Dion as Trudeau’s foreign minister, the China enthusiasts began lobbying Global Affairs Canada, where senior officials were put to work making their dreams come true. Among their big ideas: Canada’s senior defence staff should be on a first-name basis with the generals in the People’s Liberation Army. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was established as a bulwark against China’s growing influence in the Asia Pacific region? Beijing should be invited to join. The Asia Infrastructure Development Bank that Beijing had assembled to build out its Belt and Road Initiative to displace the American-led rules-based world order? Canada should invest in it. And Canada did, to the tune of a pledge totalling nearly $1 billion. Sure, Canadians were jittery about all this, but what that meant was that Ottawa should devise methods so as to be “leading public opinion” on the virtues of the new Canada-China relationship. But back to that inflection point, the moment the compass heading on that lumbering bulk carrier of the Canadian state was set in the direction of China. A confluence of events around that time were harbingers of the turmoil to come. Opinion was sharply divided in Ottawa about what to make of China’s profligate offshore spending. On one side, the standpoint was well illustrated by a remark uttered by former Liberal cabinet minister Martin Cauchon, later a member of the board of the Canada China Business Council, in November 2011: “There is a saying that if you can’t beat them, join them.” That was how Cauchon welcomed the news that Huawei, Xi Jinping’s “national champion” telecommunications behemoth — with all its service to Xi’s globe-encircling power moves and its links to China’s military and intelligence services and its association with surveillance-state infrastructure put in place by tinpot Beijing-friendly authoritarian regimes — was ramping up its operations in and around Ottawa, aided by a $6.5-million Ontario government grant. There is another saying: “We’re sitting ducks.” That’s how Anthony Campbell, the former head of the Intelligence Assessment Secretariat of the Privy Council Office, described Canada’s position in 2012. What Campbell meant was that Beijing and its state-owned enterprises were sloshing so much money around, and the federal government was so inattentive to the implications, that nobody at the centre of power in Canada was capable of articulating what the words “national security” even meant anymore. To complicate the Harper government’s grand plan to transform Canada into a global energy superpower, Beijing’s state-owned energy corporations were suddenly buying up huge swathes of the Alberta oilpatch. And these weren’t bit players. Petro-China was bigger than ExxonMobil. Sinopec calculated its annual revenues to an amount that exceeded Canada’s haul in federal tax revenue. When the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) proposed to lavish $15.1 billion on the shareholders of Calgary’s Nexen Inc., to take over the company and its holdings in their entirety, what was in the pipe was the largest acquisition, the biggest overseas outlay of cash, in the history of the People’s Republic of China. The Conservative cabinet was divided. Harper had begun his time in the Prime Minister’s Office as a “China hawk,” to use the fashionably pejorative expression. But he soon learned that there was nothing to be gained from it. The business press hounded him whenever he opened his mouth about Tibet, or the Uyghurs, or the human rights of China’s 1.4 billion people. Running for the top Liberal job, Trudeau declared out of the blue that he supported CNOOC’s bid. The CNOOC-Nexen deal would be good for Canada, Trudeau explained, because Chinese investment would create “middle-class Canadian jobs.” It was also around that time, during U.S. President Barack Obama’s tenure in office, that the U.S. Justice Department started investigating Huawei Technologies Company, a Chinese firm that Canada had generously favoured, for fraud and sanctions-evasion in Iran. The Americans warned Ottawa: You’ll want to be careful of your blossoming relationship with Huawei. No good will come of it. But Ottawa wasn’t careful. And no good came of it. The only problem Trudeau saw was that Canadians had not been adequately instructed in the correctness of his standpoint on China. “Where is the leadership to explain to Canadians why this relationship is so important, to engage Canadians in the conversation, to make us aware of the opportunities?” he wrote. Trudeau later attempted to meet what he saw as a need to make Canadians “aware of the opportunities” with a special project in aid of Beijing’s public-relations difficulties among ordinary Canadians. The Public Policy Forum brought together an array of Trudeau’s China enthusiasts in government, business and academia in what was to be a two-year exercise to make Canadians feel good about Trudeau’s big idea. It didn’t work. China’s standing continued to drop in the opinion polls, and it didn’t help that Ottawa allowed a shadowy Chinese corporation to spend $1 billion acquiring a network of nursing homes when the head of that same corporation was arrested by Chinese authorities on fraud charges. It didn’t help, either, when Ottawa unaccountably approved a Chinese acquisition of Norsat International, a firm with contracts to supply American military satellites. It also didn’t help that Trudeau’s way of doing business with China was to invite 61 Liberal donors to a state dinner with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. Those other grubby cash-for-access soirees with Chinese billionaires didn’t help, either, especially after a pair of billionaires were found to have made lavish donations to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which spent some of their dubious money on a statue of the former prime minister at McGill University in Montreal. That’s the backdrop to the way Trudeau launched Canada into Beijing’s cold embrace. Don’t be afraid, Trudeau assured us. Beijing just does things a little differently is all. We should leave our antiquated 20th-century assumptions behind us. “China, for one, sets its own rules and will continue to do so because it can,” Trudeau wrote in 2012. “China has a game plan. There is nothing inherently sinister about that.” Harper ended up letting the CNOOC-Nexen deal go ahead, but made it clear that, going forward, only in an “exceptional circumstance” would a Chinese state-owned enterprise be permitted to bite off such a huge chunk of a vital Canadian industry. That last bit did not please Beijing at all. But after Trudeau was elected, Canada settled into a new groove, and Beijing was pleased. Ever since then, the growing public alarm over repeated warnings from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and from the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) about Beijing’s myriad threats to Canadian sovereignty and national security have only served to make Trudeau less verbose about the big ideas he has about China. There’s no indication that his ideas have changed at all. Foreign Affairs minister François-Philippe Champagne kept promising some sort of new China policy, but it never came. Neither was there evidence of any new policy in Trudeau’s platform for the election campaign that just concluded — an election marred by evidence that China and its Canadian proxies engaged in a brutal disinformation campaign, targeting candidates who have shown some spine in confronting Beijing’s human rights abusers. This is exactly what CSIS and the CSE warned would happen. Canada remains alone among the Five Eyes security partners (Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom) in its silence about whether Huawei should be permitted to contribute to Canada’s 5G network. Ottawa has remained almost completely silent about a clear pattern of harassment and intimidation waged by Beijing’s proxies in Canada against human rights activists across the country — a pattern confirmed in public reports issued by CSIS. Even after Beijing began devouring Hong Kong in direct violation of the Sino-British handover agreement that was supposed to guarantee the island’s democratic autonomy after 1997, and even after incontrovertible evidence emerged about Xi’s genocidal persecution of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, the Trudeau government has given no indication that it has changed course on China. Even the arbitrary detentions of Michael Kovring and Michael Spavor were treated as unfortunate events, bumps along the road to deeper engagement with Xi’s police state. As Barton put it to the House of Commons special committee on Canada-China relations in February 2020, sure there are red lines, but “friends disagree with each other; friends get mad at each other, so we need to define where those are and make sure people understand them. We need to manage both these opportunities and challenges in concert.… We can engage and grow, and we can also be tough at the same time.” Rob Oliphant, in his role as parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau, told the same committee in March that the kidnapping of Kovrig and Spavor couldn’t stop the world from turning. After all, “the well-being of specific Canadians in detention in China needs to be considered alongside the well-being of Canadian businesses doing important agricultural business and other business in Canada, and also the people-to-people relationships that we enjoy between Canada and China.” The Trudeau government’s commitment to deeper relationships with China is shared by fewer and fewer Canadians: a Nanos poll carried out in August showed that two-thirds of Canadians want Ottawa to take a harder line with China. An Angus Reid poll released in March showed that only one in 10 Canadians agrees that Canada should pursue closer trade ties with China. Last year, the all-party National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians reported that Canada’s intelligence agencies had concluded that Canada has become an “attractive and permissive target” for Beijing-directed influence operations that threaten Canada’s foundational institutions, “including our system of democracy itself.” None of this mattered. The Trudeau government has stubbornly resisted efforts by the House of Commons to discern how Chinese researchers who collaborated with People’s Liberation Army scientists from the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party managed to obtain high-level security clearances to undertake research at the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. A cloud of suspicion was left hanging over all that when the House of Commons declared the Liberal government in contempt of Parliament for withholding unredacted documents about the firing of two scientists at the lab. The Trudeau government’s commitment to deeper relationships with China is shared by fewer and fewer Canadians. And it’s still not clear why the Trudeau government entered into a vaccine-development agreement with China’s CanSino Biologics, or why it was still a secret, weeks afterwards, that Beijing had reneged on the deal and blocked shipments to Canada. There are a lot of things that remain unclear about the Trudeau government’s approach to China, except that the “relationship,” as it is called, requires submitting to abuse, hostage diplomacy, duplicity and humiliation at the feet of Xi Jinping.

,,Lack of export infrastructure has soured China on oil investment in Canada: CNOOC official,"Private Chinese investors who are still enthusiastic about North American energy are now pouring their cash into the U.S, CNOOC advisor Weidong Chen says CALGARY — Canada has lost credibility as an investment destination because of its inability to build export infrastructure, a recently retired senior executive at China’s CNOOC Ltd., one of the country’s top three oil and gas companies, said Tuesday. After spending $35 billion in Canada’s energy industry when oil and asset prices were high, Chinese energy companies are reeling from the oil crash and cutting jobs and investment. China Investment Corp., the country’s sovereign wealth fund, shut down its Toronto office last month.    Their inability to export products due to Canada’s slow regulatory approval process has made a bad situation worse, said Beijing-based Weidong Chen, the former chief researcher at CNOOC and now an advisor to the company. “Canada is good on the legal, commercial, political stability (levels) and also technology,” Chen said on the sidelines of the Canada-China Forum. “But it’s slow, the infrastructure go slow,” he said, referring Canada’s failure to deliver proposed oil export pipelines, or any of the 20 or so liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, in British Columbia. Canadian oil and gas is discounted because it can’t reach markets outside the U.S., which is saturated with its own production. CNOOC, which became China’s biggest spender in Canada with the 2009 acquisition of oil and gas producer Nexen Inc. for $15.1-billion, has proposed to build the Aurora LNG project near Prince Rupert, B.C., but Chen is not optimistic it will get off the ground any time soon. “The federal government (in Canada) is a weak government, not like China in comparison,” he said. “Most resources are located only in Alberta … and Alberta is an inland state, they can only transport to the U.S. You go to Pacific, you have to negotiate with B.C. and B.C. has a lot of First Nations. I participated in three (annual LNG) conferences. They continuously talk about First Nations issues. I didn’t see any progress.” Get the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.    While competition for energy markets is intensifying from Russia, Australia, and now even Iran, in Canada “you just go according to your own pace,” said Chen. The comments come as Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, hopes to rebrand Canada as more than a petro-state and to invite new investment this week in Davos, where the world’s business and political elites are meeting for the World Economic Forum. Chinese companies were also invited by the federal and various provincial governments to invest in Canada, when its energy abundance was the flavor of the day. Chen said there is regret in some Chinese quarters about the Canadian investment spree and it’s unlikely to be repeated.  Private Chinese investors who are still enthusiastic about North American energy are pouring their cash into the U.S., which has successfully transformed itself from a large energy consumer into an energy exporter, he said. Brian Tuffs, president and CEO of Sinopec Canada, said Canadian holdings are still seen as core by its Chinese parent, but spending was halved in 2015 relative to 2014, and will remain at 2015 levels this year. They company has interests in the Syncrude Canada oilsands project and the Pacific North West LNG project led by Malaysia’s Petronas. It also has a 4.9 per cent stake in the stalled Northern Gateway pipeline. Speaking as a Canadian, “it is to the detriment of Canada that we have been unable to resolve our infrastructure issues to an acceptable level with all stakeholders,” Tuffs said, noting it’s not a positive for future investment. “I think we hold our industry to a level, whether its regulatory or environmental, that is world class … (but) we are market limited, and there are markets that would gladly accept our resources, and yet we are unable to get there.” Meanwhile, Brion Energy, the Canadian unit of Petro-China, is rumoured to be laying off staff this month. The first phase of its MacKay River in situ oilsands project is nearing completion. Further expansions of MacKay River and the start of construction of a second oilsands project, Dover, are rumoured to be on the shelf. Company officials did not respond to requests for information.

,,Government’s tight grasp on Alberta oil: A short(ish) history," ECONOMY Rachel Notley’s production caps raise a question: Was there ever a ‘free market’ for Canadian oil? Rachel Notley is the latest political leader to wade into the oil market THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh An NDP premier ordering production limits on private industry might normally bring widespread cries about government intervention, but not this week. The move announced Sunday by Alberta’s Rachel Notley to mandate an 8.7-per-cent holdback on oil extraction drew more praise than scorn, even from conservative rivals, because most agreed this was the only real short-term solution to a massive supply glut caused by a failure to build pipelines to move the product. Notley, as others did, reminded Albertans that they are owners of the province’s natural resources. That’s something not invoked too often these days in free-market-loving Alberta. But free-market-loving Alberta’s biggest private enterprise has felt the friendly or prickly hand of government involvement throughout its history—through direct control, subsidy and state ownership. Early interventions Let’s start with the Social Credit government of Alberta, a radical reform movement that took power in 1935 under the leadership of William “Bible Bill” Aberhart, who proposed to distribute “prosperity certificates” to residents outside of Canada’s existing currency system. Under populist control, the legislature passed a 1938 resolution to consider taking over the wholesale and retail petroleum markets to guarantee lower gasoline prices for consumers. That didn’t happen, but the same year Aberhart’s government created the Oil and Gas Conservation Board, to tame the rapidly developing Turner Valley oilfield near Calgary with production quotas and a crackdown on flaring of excess gas, an expedient practice which was literally creating towering infernos of wasted fuel. “It became evident that some wells were being produces at rates that would soon ruin them and which would result in terribly small ultimate recovery as compared with what might be expected if production was restricted and carried out on the basis of orderly development,” the province stated, according to Prairie Capitalism: Power and Influence in the New West. A previous government unsuccessfully created a conservation board in the early 1930s, but this time opposition couldn’t hamstring it: in the 1940s, the Social Credit’s provincial regulator closed down wells that overproduced. RELATED: Rachel Notley to oil sands foes: Be progressive, support pipelines Later that decade came the gusher at Leduc No. 1 near Edmonton, confirming massive reserves and triggering a major development boom. Soon, Alberta was producing twice as much as pipelines could deliver. “By 1950 Alberta literally had oil coming out its ears compared to what it could consume or market to other parts of the country,” one official said in a history of the provincial regulator. The board imposed a system called “pro-rationing” that required companies to throttle back drilling to ensure companies collectively avoided a supply glut; sometimes limits were as low as 40 per cent of capacity. This quota system remained in place until it was greatly loosened in 1987. Pipelines When Ottawa acquired the Trans Mountain pipeline and the controversial expansion project from Kinder Morgan earlier this spring, the $4.5-billion purchase marked not so much a precedent as a return to government’s former role as the architect of Canada’s fossil fuel transmission system. During the Second World War, Ottawa even let a foreign entity—the U.S. military—build one pipeline from Norman Wells, N.W.T., to Whitehorse, Yukon, to serve the war effort’s fuel hunger via Alaska. In the 1950s, Parliament enacted federal charters to build the Interprovincial oil pipeline to Wisconsin, the TransCanada natural gas conduit to Quebec and the original Trans Mountain oil line to British Columbia. The government sanctioned investor groups to build the pipelines (Interprovincial is now Enbridge, an international giant alongside TransCanada). Meanwhile, Alberta built its own natural gas transmission system—government funds and a public share sale to residents financed the Alberta Gas Trunk Line. It was privatized in 1961. Companies In 1973, Arab countries proclaimed an oil embargo on several western countries, quadrupling the world oil price and setting to boil the simmering Canadian worries its oil supply was too heavily under foreign control, primarily by U.S. firms. Pierre Trudeau’s government created Petro-Canada as a Crown corporation in 1975, and it expanded by snapping up private firms. The company was widely hated in the oil sector and Calgary; its red granite headquarters became known derisively as Red Square. RELATED: Pipelines aren’t just an Alberta issue—they are crucial to national prosperity The Alberta government, under Tory premier Peter Lougheed, also had ambitions to cut into the dominance of foreign oil companies and to maximize the value of Alberta’s resources for the public that owned them. In 1973 it launched the Alberta Energy Company, an exploration and production firm; the government’s half-stake supplemented by another Albertans-first share offering. AEC was fully privatized in 1993 and later became part of Encana. Meanwhile, the federal government gradually sold off Petro-Canada between 1991 and 2004, and the company later got swallowed up by Suncor, another oil giant with a public ownership history. Oil sands After decades of both government nudging and private interest in the oil-soaked sands around Fort McMurray, Sun Oil of Pennsylvania spearheaded Great Canadian Oil Sands Co. (later Suncor) to develop the first major bitumen mine in northeast Alberta. Raising capital for the quarter-billion-dollar megaproject proved tricky, so the Alberta government in 1964 demanded a share sale that let provincial residents each invest up to $12,500 in the project. In 1981, then-Ontario premier Bill Davis wanted a piece of that action for his province, which bought a 25-per-cent stake in Suncor; it took Ontario’s NDP government to unload the shares a dozen years later. In those days, Alberta seemed keen for the Ontario government to leap into its project investments if Ottawa or private players got cold feet. Suncor was in fact the second Queen’s Park purchase in Alberta’s oil sands: when a private consortium faced ballooning costs in the early ’70s to launch Syncrude, the second major bitumen player, Ontario swooped in to take a one-tenth share, and so did Alberta’s government, while Ottawa put in for 15 per cent. RELATED: How to make Canada an energy superpower Lougheed, meanwhile, used oil royalties to launch the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority, a provincial R&D branch for the industry that helped spur today’s extraction methods of harder-to-reach bitumen. And in the early 1990s, when oil sands development needed its next big boost, the Alberta government and Liberal-led Ottawa again stepped in—not with investments, but with major breaks in royalty rates and taxes as projects began. Central planning Before Trudeau and his National Energy Program (NEP, still a three-letter epithet out west; more on that shortly), there was former prime minister’s John Diefenbaker’s NOP of 1961. The National Oil Policy sought to ensure a domestic market for Alberta crude, so the government created a captive one: all refineries west of Ottawa were banned from foreign oil imports. A Royal Commission on Energy in 1957 had considered a broader domestic-only zone, aided by a possible Edmonton-to-Montreal crude pipeline. But Montreal and Atlantic refineries preferred retaining access to cheaper imports (to this day, Albertans grumble about the region’s reliance on Mideast and overseas supply.) The Energy East pipeline through Quebec to New Brunswick would have brought Alberta oil to the other side of Canada. But that project flamed out amid protest, daunting regulatory demands and shifting economics. The NEP that Trudeau’s government dropped in 1980 wasn’t for Alberta oil sector’s benefit; it was to give the rest of Canada cheaper fuel and redistributed energy revenues. Among its meddling ways, the program mandated lower prices for Canadian customers, levied taxes on oil and gas exports and further supercharged Petro-Canada. Together with plunging oil prices and a global recession, these policies battered the oil sector and led to massive layoffs. Lougheed fought back with a jurisdictional court fight against the tax on a provincial resource—and won. But his flashier, more currently relevant move was using old curtailment powers to throttle back the industry’s provincial output by about 15 per cent, nearly double the cut Notley has announced. Within a year of the retaliatory measure, Lougheed got Trudeau to ease off the tax; under Mulroney in the mid-1980s, the NEP died. But it gets resurrected often when critics decry the currently ruling Trudeau’s attempts to balance energy development with environmental regulation. Aside from his pipeline purchase, Justin Trudeau’s energy policy has been far more hands-off than those of his father or others—more standard government stuff like a carbon tax here, a pipeline approval cancellation there, regulatory oversight reforms hither and yon. But, his many western detractors say, all these smaller actions have led to the effective moratorium on pipeline construction that caused Notley to reach back into history and get heavy-handed.

,,Massive Canada LNG project gets green light as Asia demand for fuel booms,"Advertisement VANCOUVER/SINGAPORE: A massive liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Canada has received final approval from its partners, LNG Canada said on Tuesday, making it the first major new project for the fuel to win approval in recent years. First gas from the CAD 40 billion (USD 31 billion) project, led by Royal Dutch Shell Plc, is expected before 2025, aiming to feed an expected surge in demand for the super-chilled fuel from Asian buyers, mainly China. LNG Canada is the largest private-sector investment project in Canadian history, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference in Vancouver. The announcement provides a much-needed boost for Trudeau's ruling Liberals, who have struggled with an exodus of global majors from Alberta's oil sands and setbacks in building a crude pipeline expansion to Canada's Pacific Coast. ""We can’t build energy projects like we did in the old days where the environment and the economy were seen as opposing forces,"" Trudeau said. ""They must go together."" Canada is committing CAD 275 million to infrastructure and environmental performance measures related to LNG Canada, which will have the lowest carbon intensity of any large LNG facility in the world, Trudeau said. The project will move LNG to Asia faster than from the U.S. Gulf Coast. With global LNG demand expected to double by 2035, much of the growth will come from Asia where gas is displacing coal, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell Ben van Beurden said in a separate statement. ""LNG Canada is well positioned to help Shell meet the growing needs of customers at a time when we see an LNG supply shortage in our outlook,"" he said. Stakeholders in LNG Canada - Shell, Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd, PetroChina Co Ltd, Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp - have all made final investment decisions, LNG Canada said. ""Getting an LNG project to a final investment decision is like a moon landing,"" said Maarten Wetselaar, Shell's integrated gas and new energies director, in Vancouver. ""It is very, very difficult to do, and requires teamwork."" Shell said construction at Kitimat, British Columbia, will start immediately. In a statement, Mitsubishi said the total development cost of the planned Kitimat LNG plant is about USD 14 billion. The cost for the liquefaction plant and a 670-kilometre pipeline to connect gas to the plant will exceed 2 trillion yen (USD 17.6 billion), a company official said. Shell said the project will initially export LNG from two processing units or trains totalling 14 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). The project may add two more trains totalling 14 million tpa, Mitsubishi said. PetroChina and KOGAS approved project financing late last week while Shell, Petronas and Mitsubishi made announcements on Tuesday. KOGAS said this will be Korea's first major project in Canada. The joint venture of JGC-Fluor Corp has been appointed as the project's engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Pipeline operator TransCanada Corp said on Tuesday it will proceed with construction of its Coastal GasLink pipeline, which will transport natural gas from the Montney gas-producing region near Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to the LNG Canada facility. The project will boost Canada's oilpatch, which has struggled to attract investment due to the government's stumbles in winning regulatory approval to expand the Trans Mountain oil pipeline. Natural gas producers such as Encana Corp and Tourmaline Oil Corp stand to gain as Canada's depressed gas prices rise, Raymond James analysts said. Smaller pipeline companies including Pembina Pipeline Corp will also benefit, said RBC analyst Robert Kwan. RISING APPETITE LNG Canada is the first large-scale conventional new LNG project to reach a final investment decision (FID) since 2013, said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia. ""LNG Canada's FID would signal the appetite to invest in LNG is back,"" Kavonic said. The project owners will provide their own natural gas supply and will individually market their share of LNG, LNG Canada said in the statement. The construction decision comes amid a Sino-U.S. trade dispute that has led to tariffs being imposed by China on LNG shipments from the United States, threatening U.S. President Donald Trump's energy dominance plan. Energy consultancy Wood MacKenzie said it appeared project partners had pushed hard to reach an investment decision, with rival projects progressing in Qatar, Russia, Mozambique and the United States. ""I don't see it as a case of replacing U.S. cargoes, more about meeting projected demand growth,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Nicholas Browne.

Though flawed, the policy showed how state intervention in the energy sector could overcome the boom-and-bust of the business cycle. Petro-Canada was founded as a state-owned company in 1975, as part of the Canadian federal government’s National Energy Program. (Trekphiler / Wikimedia Commons) Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. In April 2020, Canadians were treated to the irony of ardent free-market conservative and premier of Alberta Jason Kenney nationalizing private infrastructure. Kenney’s government invested $1.5 billion directly into the Keystone XL pipeline that runs from Alberta all the way down to Texas. In addition to putting up funds for the construction of the pipeline, Kenney also provided another $6 billion in loan guarantees for the project. His enthusiasm was, however, not matched by his neighbors south of the border. On his first day in office, Joe Biden, in keeping with his campaign promise, canceled the construction permit. Kenney’s bad bet — made with public money — was evidently made on the assumption that Donald Trump was going to win a second term. Nationalizing pipelines appears to be in vogue with Canadian governments of all political stripes these days. Justin Trudeau’s federal Liberal Party government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline in 2018. The petroleum industry, meanwhile, has been content with this direct government intervention, but has nevertheless continued to moan that “we lack a clear national energy strategy.” The industry maintains that global market access has been inhibited by the absence of new pipeline infrastructure. Its representatives have complained that “although Canada produces much more crude oil than it consumes, incredibly we import 760,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the US and other foreign countries.” The last time a federal government tried to implement a national energy strategy, it was greeted with teeth-gnashing and apoplectic fury from Canada’s West. In 1980, the federal Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau, father of the current prime minister, introduced the National Energy Program (NEP) to build cross-country pipelines to ensure that Canada did not need to import foreign crude. Not only did the oil industry revolt against the intervention, but the backlash in Alberta set the stage for decades of outrage and self-pitying claims of victimhood on the part of regional oil producers. The NEP saga is still relevant today because its legacy is baked into the politics of energy in Canada. It pitted public benefit against private interest for control of national energy resources. Oil companies fiercely resisted attempts at state-directed oil development in favor of letting profit decide where pipelines should go. The consequence was that pipelines went mostly to the United States, locking Canadian oil exports into a single market. Understanding the roots of the NEP and the current politics of energy requires some knowledge of the history of oil and gas development in Canada after World War II. In 1947, Canada found huge oil deposits in Leduc, Alberta. The ensuing oil boom rapidly transformed the province’s rural agricultural economy into an industrialized oil exporter. As of 2019, Canada has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world at 167 billion barrels, almost all of which is in Alberta. Canadian energy policy in the 1950s and 1960s was concerned with promoting expansion of the domestic oil industry. In 1961, the national oil market was split in two. East of the Ottawa Valley, where most Canadians lived, oil was imported cheaply from the world market. In the West, the oil market was protected from imports and consumers paid higher prices to subsidize domestic production. Because the Canadian oil industry was largely American-owned and primarily exported to the US market, Western Canada was also integrated into the US oil market through price-fixing agreements. This arrangement collapsed in 1973. In response to Western support for Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Arab oil-producing countries cut off their crude exports to much of the developed capitalist world. Oil prices had been low and stable since 1945, but between October 1973 and March 1974 — when the embargo ended — prices more than tripled. They would stay high for a decade, with a further spike in 1979 thanks to the Iranian Revolution. Although Canada was a net oil exporter, its divided market and lack of East-West pipelines meant that the country could not supply itself entirely through its domestic production. In 1973, the country shipped fifty percent of its oil and gas south of the border. At the same time, Eastern Canada was hit by extremely high fuel prices. Because the industry was largely US-owned, the windfall profits from high prices were shipped south too and did not directly benefit the Canadian economy. The Liberal federal government of Pierre Trudeau responded by freezing the domestic price of crude at $4 a barrel, well below the world price. Next, the government implemented a tax on oil exports to discourage companies from simply selling domestically produced oil on the world market to avoid Canada’s price cap. The government then poured public money into developing unconventional oil sources such as the Athabasca oil sands in northern Alberta. In 1975, the Liberals created the state-owned company Petro-Canada to aid these efforts. Prices remained high through the 1970s. The federal government decided that a more comprehensive plan was needed to secure Canadian energy sovereignty. In the 1980 election, the Liberals campaigned on a “made-in-Canada” oil price, and, after winning, they introduced the NEP. The NEP had three main goals: fair energy prices for Canadian consumers; an increase in Canadian ownership (both public and private) to majority stakes of the oil and gas sector; and the securing of Canada’s energy supplies. Accomplishing these goals would give Canada energy sovereignty, insulate domestic energy prices from world market–price spikes, and ensure most of the profits earned by the petroleum sector stayed in Canada. In practice, these goals were accomplished using a series of price controls and tax incentives, rather than any wholesale nationalization of foreign assets. Domestic oil prices were capped below the world market, but the government also established a price floor to cover for a potential fall in global crude prices. Taxes on resource revenues were recycled to Canadian petroleum companies that prospected for new fields in joint partnership with Petro-Canada. Pierre Trudeau’s government also planned cross-country pipelines to end his country’s dependence on imports. Over the five-year lifespan of the NEP, consumers benefited from stable fuel prices, and Canadian ownership significantly increased. However, foreign companies did retain dominance, especially in refining and retail. On balance, the NEP was successful in using government intervention to increase Canadian public benefits from the country’s energy resources. Unsurprisingly, the oil industry hated the NEP and threatened to reduce investment. Petro-Canada’s headquarters in downtown Calgary was derisively called “Red Square” by right-wing oilmen who resented “socialist” government intervention in their industry. The NEP remains one of the foundational flashpoints for Alberta’s resentment of perceived federal government overreach. Popular bumper stickers from the time read, “Let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark,” “I’d rather push this thing a mile than buy gas from PetroCan,” and “Pierre Elliot Trudeau Rips Off Canada.” The high prices for oil after 1973 were not the result of an increase in the cost of production, which remained more or less stable throughout the period, but instead had geopolitical roots. This meant that producers were capturing massive windfall profits on every barrel of oil they exported to the United States. The NEP’s prioritization of the Canadian domestic market, price controls, and higher royalty taxes cut into the huge profit margins of the mostly US companies. The Alberta provincial government also opposed the NEP, seeing it as a federal intrusion on provincial jurisdiction over resources. Federal price and export controls reduced provincial royalty revenue from high global prices. The Alberta government of Progressive Conservative Peter Lougheed was also deeply intertwined with the oil industry. Alberta’s intransigence forced several rounds of renegotiation with the federal government over price setting in 1981 and 1983. The result of this showdown was the blunting of some of the effects of the NEP. In 1984, the Progressive Conservatives of Brian Mulroney defeated the Liberal federal government. As promised, he dismantled the NEP the next year and, in the early 1990s, privatized Petro-Canada. The oil industry got the free market it wanted. But by 1985, the oil glut on the world market had caused prices to collapse. This drove Alberta into a severe and protracted recession. University of Alberta economist Andrew Leach estimates that between 1980 and 2013, the Canadian oil industry lost $160 billion in potential revenue because of low world prices and the absence of an NEP-assured price floor.  The NEP was designed, in part, to reduce the domestic impact of extreme boom-and-bust cycles that characterize the petroleum industry. Alberta has been hammered by consistently low oil prices since 2014. In April of last year, the price of oil was briefly below $37.63 USD a barrel. The prospect of a green energy transition creates further uncertainty for the fossil fuel–dependent Alberta economy. The NEP is not merely a curio in the history of Canada’s extractive industries — the story of its development contains useful lessons for the Left today. The politics of energy are very important for the Left in our era of climate crisis. Canada is presently operating a “no-energy-program plan.” This dithering around energy policy will result in either business as usual —  a resignation to cook the planet — or an unmanaged green energy transition that will result in a chaotic oil industry collapse, with attendant negative social consequences. If we are going to tackle climate change, reviving the NEP of forty years ago simply won’t do. It is far too late for Canada to try and extract greater public benefit from our fossil fuel industry — the sector needs to be wound down. What the history of the NEP demonstrates is that a Green National Energy Program is possible. Energy is a key part of any green transition and deciding who controls energy is central to any democratic left-wing political project. Government intervention can ensure that new green energy sources are treated as a public good. State planning can develop green energy resources in coherent and rational ways rather than leaving it to the anarchy of the market. With strong government intervention, oil workers do not have to be left to fend for themselves in the event of a green transition — we can fight for them to be retrained. The NEP and Petro-Canada were good models for their time. Now, they provide useful prototypes for future green energy, public ownership, and the winding down of fossil fuel production.

,,"EDITORIAL: Trudeau’s carbon tax -- the good, bad and ugly","The good news is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will start sending tax-free money to Canadians living in Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba on Friday to help pay for their increased cost of living due to Trudeau’s carbon tax.      The bad news is Parliament’s independent, non-partisan financial watchdog, Yves Giroux, says even with these carbon tax rebates, most people will end up worse off financially compared to Trudeau’s carbon tax.  Ottawa says 80% of households will receive more in climate action incentive payments (CAIPs) than they pay in carbon taxes in the four provinces where Trudeau imposed them because he wasn’t satisfied with their provincial governments’ plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  But Giroux says when the full costs of Trudeau’s carbon tax are considered — including its negative impact on economic growth, labour incomes and business investment — 60% of households will pay more in carbon taxes than they get in rebates this year.  The amount people receive — previously a refundable tax credit and now automatically distributed as a cheque or bank deposit to anyone who filed their income taxes last year — depends on the province where they live and the size of their household.  Ottawa says the average Ontario household will receive $712 in CAIP payments this year (half on July 15, followed by quarterly payments on Oct. 15, 2022 and Jan. 15, 2023) while paying $578 in carbon taxes for a net gain of $134.  In Alberta, $1,038 in CAIP payments while paying $700 in carbon taxes for a net gain of $338.  In Saskatchewan, $1,053 in CAIP payments, while paying $734 in carbon taxes for a net gain of $319.  In Manitoba, $788 in CAIP payments, while paying $559 in carbon taxes for a net gain of $229.  After Jan. 15, 2023, CAIPs will be distributed quarterly as Trudeaus’s carbon tax rises from $50 per tonne of emissions this year to $170 in 2030.  People living in small and rural communities are also eligible for a 10% top-up in CAIPs.  But Giroux says when you work out the full economic cost of Trudeau’s carbon tax versus the CAIPs, the average household in Ontario will end up $360 in the hole this fiscal year, Alberta $671, Saskatchewan $390 and Manitoba $299.   365 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Ontario, M4W 3L4  ",torontosun.com,https://torontosun.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-trudeaus-carbon-tax-the-good-bad-and-ugly,"© 2024 Toronto Sun, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

,,Justin Trudeau isn’t phasing out Alberta’s oil industry — but the world might," Alternate access --
Canada is on fire, and big oil is the arsonist
Canada subsidises oil and gas more than any other G20 nation, averaging $14bn annually between 2018 and 2020. Wha!!!!! You mean to say that the world is leaving behind oil and gas no matter how much I fly my fuck Trudeau flag? /s Maybe buy another flag? That will surely solve your problem. In fact, make it your entire identity /s They can change it to ""F🌎CK the World"" flag. Which is what they are doing anyways. Maybe you forgot to burn some pride flags too while at it, that should help /s (looking at you, asshhole in Airdrie). The author of this article is holier-than-thou and very smug to the point of being grating on my nerves. But he does bring up a good point: a global transition is underway; because the technology now allows for it and climate change is real and we're living through the early challenges of it. So, does Alberta take the lead or do we sit on our hands and complain like a child who didn;t get their juice box. Those who take the lead today, will profit significantly tomorrow. It’s Alberta. The last election is your answer. Doesn't matter who does it. Guaranteed, the mouth breathing UCP base will blame Trudeau and Notely (somehow). Facts over feelings. Bullshit over....the way time actually works. And the UCP will happily tap into their jaw-dropping stupidity and mindless hate, again, for another win. But Trudeau = the World Economic Forum = Trudeau's Fault = Danielle Smith bellyaching that Ottawa needs to protect oil and gas like a UNESCO World Heritage Industry What an optimistic article. The world won't. The world doesn't care either. I promise you. 2030 sometime the ""net zero"" goal posts get moved.

,,Stoltenberg: Strengthening Europe's defense capabilities 'not an alternative to NATO',"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed European allies' efforts to strengthen their own defense capabilities but said that this policy ""is not an alternative to NATO"" when commenting on Donald Trump's recent anti-NATO comments. Trump, who is seeking re-election, drew criticism for saying on Feb. 10 that he would not protect NATO countries who fail to meet their spending commitments. ""In fact, I would encourage (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want,"" he said at a campaign rally. U.S. President Joe Biden said that Trump's statement sent a dangerous and ""un-American"" message to the international community, calling it an ""invitation"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade NATO allies. At a press conference ahead of the meetings of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg was asked by a journalist whether Trump's statements ""will signal the beginning of the end of NATO and the beginning of something else in Europe."" ""I welcome that European Allies are investing more in defense. NATO has called for that for many, many years, and NATO has also called for European Allies to invest more in high-end capabilities, more forces, and high readiness. Now, European Allies are delivering that, and that is a good thing. But that is not an alternative to NATO,"" Stoltenberg replied. ""That is actually a way to strengthen NATO, and we should not pursue any path that indicates that we are trying to divide Europe from North America. The strength is that we have Europe and North America together in NATO. "" Non-EU NATO Allies cover 80% of NATO's defense spending, and ""this is not only about resources but also about geography,"" Stoltenberg said. ""If we look to the South, we have Turkiye, a non-EU Ally but important for the Southern flank. In the North you have countries like Norway and Iceland, perhaps not the biggest military powers but still extremely critical for the Trans-Atlantic link, for the protection of North America and Europe. And in the West, you have the United States, Canada but also the United Kingdom,"" he explained. ""So the strength of NATO is that we bring Europe and North America together; together, we have 50% of the roles of economic might; 50% of the roles of military might, so as long as we stand together, we are able to send a message to any adversary that we are able to protect all Allies."" Biden addressed Trump's inflammatory claims in a statement urging the House of Representatives to pass a supplementary funding bill that would send $60 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. The Senate passed the bipartisan aid package early on Feb. 13. Republicans in Congress have stalled aid to Ukraine for months in a contentious debate about the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the 2024 elections, has lobbied aggressively against bipartisan border legislation and aid to Ukraine.
