,,Don’t Get Scammed By The Taylor Swift Le Creuset Giveaway,"Written by: Thomas Orsolya Published on: December 22, 2023 A fraudulent online campaign claiming mega pop star Taylor Swift has collaborated with Le Creuset for an epic holiday giveaway has infiltrated social media through manipulated advertisements and questionable external websites. However, the supposed cookware freebie offer intends stealing users’ money and data rather than reasonable celebrity product charity. This article exposes the systematic deception strategies such appliance scams employ to financially exploit even prudent individuals alongside protection guidance avoiding potential damages.  This Article Contains: The increasingly common celebrity-fronted product giveaway scam starts circulating online ads run across popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. These feature deepfake AI video content portraying Taylor Swift enthusiastically explaining an exclusive deal gifting free Le Creuset cookware sets to random fans who enter in time: “Hey guys, Taylor Swift here with some exciting news!” exclaims the simulated promotional video spots. “To celebrate the holidays and thank my amazing fans this year, I’ve teamed up with Le Creuset to give away some of their gorgeous Dutch ovens totally FREE!” The fabricated Swifty representation claims that viewers simply follow included links and pay minor shipping vouchers around $10 to secure contest ownership of the expensive kitchenwares. However, users then get rerouted outside social media to various elaborate phishing websites completely unassociated with Le Creuset or the real Taylor Swift and her management. Decoy portal pages like “foxlifestyleoffers.com” showcase the Le Creuset logo alongside fake news articles depicting the giveaway already covered widely by established outlets like Fox and People Magazine. This aims overcoming initial skepticism justifying requests later asking sensitive customer payment and personal data rather than raising red flags. Website headers trumpet: “Taylor Swift Partners With Le Creuset for Massive Nationwide Cookware Giveaway – Claim Yours Now!” After scrolling through fake inventory shortage cover stories and customer testimonials, visitors eventually reach customized order forms promising delivery of the free cookware sets solely pending small $9.96 upfront shipping/handling fees. However hidden subscription clauses discreetly authorize recurring monthly charges from partners rather than reasonable one-time payments expected under $10. In the end, victims receive no high-end cooking products actually promised. But compromised information enables scammers inflicting financial damages through shady underground data sale channels thanks to unlocked credit card or account access handed over chasing deals seemingly too good to pass up. The fraudulent Taylor Swift Le Creuset giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims through the following deceptive process: The scam starts using AI deepfake videos falsely portraying Swift herself endorsing the epic holiday Le Creuset giveaway for fans. Her face and name recognition builds initial social hype spreading wider reach. Clicking on those videos and captions sends viewers outside social media to fake giveaway portal pages like “foxlifestyleoffers.com” mimicking reputable news brands. These feature more Taylor imagery alongside promotion details overcoming skepticism. Fake customer reviews and claims of limited supply remaining compel urgently desired actions outside logical concerns. “Hurry! Only 16 free Le Creuset sets left for this exclusive Taylor Swift giveaway!” Customized order forms conveniently require private sensitive input exceeding reasonable needs justifying contest shipment logistics. Hidden terms and conditions passages reveal victims actually consent steep recurring charges exceeding $100 monthly when attempting promotions rather than reasonable one-time $10 voucher costs depicted. With access to now compromised confidential information, recurring charges activate alongside potentials for reselling data through unregulated dark web channels – each inflicting long-term financial damages through deception. In summary, the celebrity appliance giveaway scam ensnares social media users through emotional triggers, urgency cues and concealed terms disclosing unreasonable financial objectives unrelated to reasonable giveaway transparency initially pitched. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity appliance scam also leverages a network of deceitful phishing websites helping lend false credibility justifying requests for sensitive user payment information and data later. Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincingly professional first impressions. Fraudulent pages deliberately feature logos from established media brands like Fox News, ABC and CNN without permission aiming to dupe initial visitors into assuming previous journalistic review vetting unbelievable sweepstakes authenticity already. Another effective tactic giving the illusion of third-party credibility involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes praising the epic holiday cookware giveaway urgency. But further inspection reveals no records correlating the messages to any actual endorsement press releases. For example, sites proclaim: “I can’t wait to see fans unboxing their very own Le Creuset Dutch ovens on TikTok this holiday season after entering my biggest giveaway ever!” says the falsely attributed Taylor Swift quote. But misinforming visitors intends lowering guard for later requesting financial disclosures rather than reasonable transparency offering free merchandise in exchange for little initial investment. While prominent graphics prompt urgent participation scarcely reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages reveal victims registering for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices as depicted repeatedly in above advertisements. This clearly demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus transparency. So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes tied closely to celebrity status tempt engagement on surface levels, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages consistently. Carefully assess emotional hooks against objective facts. In addition to external fraudulent websites, the supposed Taylor Swift free Le Creuset giveaway also flows heavily through major social media channels like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated video content and other deception tactics targeting users. Let’s review what suspicious signals commonly expose the questionable cookware promotion on each platform. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common problems: For example, deepfake spots claiming Taylor Swift gifted free Le Creuset sets deserve vetting before engagement. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to free Le Creuset offers: Specifically, any Instagram video pretending Taylor Swift gifted Le Creuset sets deserves reasonable scrutiny before proceeding further. Apply extra caution towards TikTok videos exhibiting these problems: If you spot an oddly persuasive video diverting outside a platform seeming too good believing, trust instincts and independently verify authenticity first. Across all social channels, supposed celebrity-tied opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain warrant reasonable inspection before participation, protecting oneself from preventable damages. What seems too good often is until proven otherwise. Maintain healthy skepticism. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting questionable giveaways, immediately take action: Alert pertinent banking and credit institutions regarding discovery of an appliance scam scheme using celebrity endorsements under false pretenses allowing undisclosed account charges lacking proper consent. Ask about launching fraud disputes and temporary reimbursements during investigations. Collect customer service contact information from documents tied to scam services and subscriptions. Call each provider clearly stating revoked authorization realizing those situations took advantage through deception rather than reasonable terms depicted initially about securing free products requiring only shipping. Record confirmation details should charges persist anyway which remains common dealing unethical groups demonstrating untrustworthiness. Recheck statements routinely ensuring cancellation holds since follow up contact often proves impossible reaching largely anonymous operators located abroad. Since shared personally identifiable information or account access retains vulnerabilities, immediately update passwords and enable stronger multi-factor authentication across logins. Consider proactive credit monitoring or bureau fraud alerts informing suspicious activities requiring quick intervention as well. File complete reports about offending companies, scam portals and damages incurred under false pretenses with government and third-party protection groups documenting events. Provide all available website names, header images displaying unauthorized trademark usage alongside celebrity media facilitating deception. Such filings support investigating broad repeat offender patterns eventually warranting legal intervention assisting negatively impacted victims previously believing initial misrepresentations without hesitation. While highly convincing initially, several consistent suspicious signals help reveal when celebrity product giveaways truly intend facilitating financial theft rather than reasonable marketing lead generations or charity: 1. Unauthorized Celebrity Affiliation Claims 2. Psychological Tactics Incentivizing Urgency Over Logic 3. Patterned Activities From Key Promoters 4. Intermediate External Website Links 5. Mismatched Fine Print Terms Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions regarding supposed Taylor Swift sponsored Le Creuset holiday giveaway promotions currently circulating social media and suspicious external websites. Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seemingly showing Taylor Swift endorsing an extraordinary Le Creuset giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam effort aiming to phish peoples’ payment credentials and personal information rather than donate expensive cookware free to random individuals. No reputable evidence suggests authenticity behind promotions. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely depicting Swift endorsing the giveaway alongside imagery showing her baking holiday treats inside Le Creuset branded Dutch ovens. Additionally, elaborate external portal pages mimic reputable news brand logos alongside urgency cues encouraging desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions disclosures also bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering one-time product shipment costs estimated around $10. No logical reason explains a celebrity randomly gifting total strangers $400+ cookware sets simply covering minor shipping logistics alone. It reasonably makes little sense. While certainly possible someday in future during album promotions, supposed existing viral Le Creuset contests fronted by Ms. Swift instead likely represent third-party scam attempts trying to falsely suggest advocacy towards subtly advancing personal agendas causing preventable financial harm. Despite flashy social media incentives promising free high-end Le Creuset sets to fans attempting order processes, unfortunate victims never receive devices. However, buried terms forms reveal accidentally consenting signing up for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time product shipment fees depicted initially. Those discovering unauthorized charges appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity product giveaways should first urgently notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions related sham discovery requesting assistance. Shutdown compromised account access risks then report details naming businesses behind such practices to appropriate fraud reporting groups exposing schemes warning public faster stopping victimization vulnerabilities. Never assume automatic honesty around online free offers tied closely incredible stories conveniently requiring temporarily relinquishing sensitive data first without external validation. The bottom line guidance avoiding appliance scams involving famous figures: 1. Independently Verify Legitimacy Through Unbiased Third Party Research If promotions seem questionable, thoroughly vet key endorsement claims and product availability specifics through impartial objective authoritative sources before acting. 2. Carefully Analyze Legal Terms, Conditions and Disclosures Closely studying fine print often exposes unreasonable monthly charges contradicting reasonable single sweepstakes shipping costs. 3. Consider Both Individual and Collective Red Flag Warning Signs While no lone suspicious signal definitively confirms scams, collectively assessing inconsistencies provides clearer fraud likelihood perspective. 4. Responsibly Report All Predatory Scam Attempts Even if financial damages incurred seem limited, reporting scams through documenting warning signs and damages incurred under false pretenses to national trade complaint databases helps all vulnerable populations avoiding repeated predatory targeting from orchestrators facing no accountability otherwise. Today’s technologies empower scammers imitating respected celebrity figures through social channels intending to manipulate psychological vulnerabilities rather than demonstrating genuine goodwill. But proactively maintaining heightened skepticism and insisting external validation prior acting puts control back in individuals’ hands avoiding regrettable troubles later. Here are 10 basic security tips to help you avoid malware and protect your device: Use a good antivirus and keep it up-to-date. It's essential to use a good quality antivirus and keep it up-to-date to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. We are huge fans of Malwarebytes Premium and use it on all of our devices, including Windows and Mac computers as well as our mobile devices. Malwarebytes sits beside your traditional antivirus, filling in any gaps in its defenses, and providing extra protection against sneakier security threats. Keep software and operating systems up-to-date. Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Whenever an update is released for your device, download and install it right away. These updates often include security fixes, vulnerability patches, and other necessary maintenance. Be careful when installing programs and apps. Pay close attention to installation screens and license agreements when installing software. Custom or advanced installation options will often disclose any third-party software that is also being installed. Take great care in every stage of the process and make sure you know what it is you're agreeing to before you click ""Next."" Install an ad blocker. Use a browser-based content blocker, like AdGuard. Content blockers help stop malicious ads, Trojans, phishing, and other undesirable content that an antivirus product alone may not stop. Be careful what you download. A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. Be alert for people trying to trick you. Whether it's your email, phone, messenger, or other applications, always be alert and on guard for someone trying to trick you into clicking on links or replying to messages. Remember that it's easy to spoof phone numbers, so a familiar name or number doesn't make messages more trustworthy. Back up your data. Back up your data frequently and check that your backup data can be restored. You can do this manually on an external HDD/USB stick, or automatically using backup software. This is also the best way to counter ransomware. Never connect the backup drive to a computer if you suspect that the computer is infected with malware. Choose strong passwords. Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don't use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it's important to follow these 10 basic safety rules. By doing so, you can protect yourself from many of the unpleasant surprises that can arise when using the web.

,,"No, Taylor Swift is not giving away Le Creuset cookware — it’s a scam","BOBBIE’S BESTS FOR LESS: UP TO 50% OFF HER FAVORITE FINDS — PICKS FROM HAUS LABS, VERSED AND MORE       Hopefully, social media users who saw Taylor Swift promoting free cookware on platforms like Facebook knew the ads were trouble before they clicked in. Fake advertisements for the cookware brand Le Creuset, appearing to feature Swift’s stamp of approval, have appeared on Facebook and other social platforms in recent weeks. The advertisements use strewn-together clips of the singer with a synthesized version of her voice and images of Le Creuset Dutch ovens. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” a fake advertisement featuring Swift’s augmented voice begins. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” The ad then instructs users to click on a button and answer questions in order to receive the brand’s free cookware. The comments section of the Facebook post featuring Swift’s voice highlighted the various methods that the creators of the false ad used to legitimize the “giveaway.” “Get in 10 days! Long waiting but anyway the set is great! Thank you guys!!” one account commented. But other users were quick to jump in and call out the advertisement for being false while also sharing their experience with falling for the advertisement. “I paid the shipping, stupidly, and never received the cookware,” one user commented. “Shame on me for falling for it. Don’t do it!” Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Meta tells TODAY.com that the ad has been removed. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” a spokesperson for Le Creuset told NBC News. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Dr. David S. Touretzky, a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Science Department & Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute, tells TODAY.com that the Le Creuset scam only faked Taylor Swift’s voice. “The images it used were real,” he explains. “Faking images is possible but requires a lot more work.” The fake Le Creuset advertisement is far from the first to use artificial intelligence to fake a celebrity’s face or voice for scamming purposes. Similar scam ads on Facebook show Oprah Winfrey also promoting the cookware giveaway. In November 2023, Scarlett Johansson and her legal team went after Lisa AI, an AI art generator and avatar maker, for using her likeness for online advertisements. As troubling as these campaigns can be, Touretzky underscores that before deepfakes arrived, people would hire voice impersonators to pull off similar scams. “But finding people who could both do that well and were willing to facilitate a crime might be difficult. Using computers is easier because they have no morals and won’t rat you out to the authorities,” he continues. Touretzky explains that in order to fake someone’s voice, samples of their speech need to be collected. With Taylor Swift having been everywhere this year, bad actors certainly had plenty of content to pull from. “You use this as training data for a machine learning algorithm that builds a model of their speech patterns: their pronunciation, intonation, voice timbre, speaking rhythm,” he explains. “Using that model, you can take speech from someone else and transform it so that it sounds like the person you’re trying to imitate.” Touretzky notes that there’s no rewinding the clock on deepfake technology. “The technology isn't going back in the bottle,” he says. “If anything, as computers get more powerful, it will become even more widespread. Maybe in a year or two, you’ll be able to get an app for your phone that lets you speak like Morgan Freeman or Dame Judi Dench. “Catching people who misuse the technology will have to rely on better ability to trace where the money goes,” he says.

,,"No, That’s Not Taylor Swift Peddling Le Creuset Cookware","Artificial Intelligence ADVERTISEMENT  The singer did not promote a giveaway of the popular cookware, but an artificially generated version of her voice suggested otherwise. Taylor Swift’s affinity for Le Creuset is real: Her collection of the cookware has been featured on a Tumblr account dedicated to the pop star’s home décor, showcased in her gift choices at a fan’s bridal shower and shown in a Netflix documentary that was highlighted by Le Creuset’s Facebook page. What is not real: Ms. Swift’s endorsement of the company’s products, which have appeared in recent weeks in ads on Facebook and elsewhere featuring her face and voice. The ads are among the many celebrity-focused scams made far more convincing by artificial intelligence. Within a single week in October, the actor Tom Hanks, the journalist Gayle King and the YouTube personality MrBeast all said that A.I. versions of themselves had been used, without permission, for deceptive dental plan promotions, iPhone giveaway offers and other ads. In Ms. Swift’s case, experts said, artificial intelligence technology helped create a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, which was cobbled together with footage of her alongside clips showing Le Creuset Dutch ovens. In several ads, Ms. Swift’s cloned voice addressed “Swifties” — her fans — and said she was “thrilled” to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day. ADVERTISEMENT Le Creuset said it was not involved with the singer for any consumer giveaway. The company urged shoppers to check its official online accounts before clicking on suspicious ads. Representatives of Ms. Swift, who was named Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2023, did not respond to requests for comment. Famous people have lent their celebrity to advertisers for as long as advertising has existed. Sometimes, it has been unwillingly. More than three decades ago, Tom Waits sued Frito-Lay — and won nearly $2.5 million — after the corn chip company imitated the singer in a radio ad without his permission. The Le Creuset scam campaign also featured fabricated versions of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, who in 2022 posted an exasperated video about the prevalence of fake social media ads, emails and websites falsely claiming that she endorsed weight loss gummies. Over the past year, major advances in artificial intelligence have made it far easier to produce an unauthorized digital replica of a real person. Audio spoofs have been especially easy to produce and difficult to identify, said Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo. The Le Creuset scam campaign was probably created using a text-to-speech service, Dr. Lyu said. Such tools usually translate a script into an A.I.-generated voice, which can then be incorporated into existing video footage using lip-syncing programs. ADVERTISEMENT “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” said Dr. Lyu, who added that it was possible to make a “decent-quality video” in less than 45 minutes. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” Dozens of separate but similar Le Creuset scam ads featuring Ms. Swift — many of them posted this month — were visible as of late last week on Meta’s public Ad Library. (The company owns Facebook and Instagram.) The campaign also ran on TikTok. The ads sent viewers to websites that mimicked legitimate outlets like the Food Network, which showcased fake news coverage of the Le Creuset offer alongside testimonials from fabricated customers. Participants were asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware. Those who complied faced hidden monthly charges without ever receiving the promised cookware. Some of the fake Le Creuset ads, such as one mimicking the interior designer Joanna Gaines, had a deceptive sheen of legitimacy on social media thanks to labels identifying them as sponsored posts or as originating from verified accounts. In April, the Better Business Bureau warned consumers that fake celebrity scams made with A.I. were “more convincing than ever.” Victims were often left with higher-than-expected charges and no sign of the product they had ordered. Bankers have also reported attempts by swindlers to use voice deepfakes, or synthetic replicas of real people’s voices, to commit financial fraud. ADVERTISEMENT In the past year, several well-known people have publicly distanced themselves from ads featuring their A.I.-manipulated likeness or voice. This summer, fake ads spread online that purported to show the country singer Luke Combs promoting weight loss gummies recommended to him by the fellow country musician Lainey Wilson. Ms. Wilson posted an Instagram video denouncing the ads, saying that “people will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it is lies.” Mr. Combs’s manager, Chris Kappy, also posted an Instagram video denying involvement in the gummy campaign and accusing foreign companies of using artificial intelligence to replicate Mr. Combs’s likeness. “To other managers out there, A.I. is a scary thing and they’re using it against us,” he wrote. A TikTok spokesperson said the app’s ads policy requires advertisers to obtain consent for “any synthetic media which contains a public figure,” adding that TikTok’s community standards require creators to disclose “synthetic or manipulated media showing realistic scenes.” Meta said it took action on the ads that violated its policies, which prohibit content that uses public figures in a deceptive way to try to cheat users out of money. The company said it had taken legal steps against some perpetrators of such schemes, but added that malicious ads were often able to evade Meta’s review systems by cloaking their content. With no federal laws in place to address A.I. scams, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would aim to limit their damage. Two bills introduced in Congress last year — the Deepfakes Accountability Act in the House and the No Fakes Act in the Senate — would require guardrails such as content labels or permission to use someone’s voice or image. ADVERTISEMENT At least nine states, including California, Virginia, Florida and Hawaii, have laws regulating A.I.-generated content. For now, Ms. Swift will probably continue to be a popular subject of A.I. experimentation. Synthetic versions of her voice pop up regularly on TikTok, performing songs she never sang, colorfully sounding off on critics and serving as phone ringtones. An English-language interview she gave in 2021 on “Late Night With Seth Meyers” was dubbed with an artificial rendering of her voice speaking Mandarin. One website charges up to $20 for personalized voice messages from “the A.I. clone of Taylor Swift,” promising “that the voice you hear is indistinguishable from the real thing.” An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to a Variety article. The article described Taylor Swift in someone else’s kitchen, not her own. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

,,AI-generated ads using Taylor Swift's likeness dupe fans with fake Le Creuset giveaway,"Watch CBS News Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: January 16, 2024 / 4:40 PM EST / CBS News AI-generated video spots featuring the likeness of Taylor Swift endorsing a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway have duped some fans into buying into the scam, the New York Times reported.  While Swift may be a fan of Le Creuset, she has no official marketing ties to the company. But ads permeating Facebook and other social media platforms would have you think otherwise.  The woman seen in the faux promotional video is neither Swift, nor even a real person. Instead, artificial intelligence has been used to replicate the singer's voice and appearance to create a convincing replication known as a ""deepfake."" Scammers create this type of synthetic content with machine learning software to create fake footage of public figures using authentic video and audio clips of them, which are abundant and easy to come by online.  ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here,"" the deepfake replica of Swift says in the video. ""Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."" Users are directed by the AI-generated woman to click a button below the ad to complete a survey, and to do so immediately ""as supplies are running out.""  It's unclear who is behind the scams. A Facebook account called ""The most profitable shares"" was one poster of the Swift-inspired scam. Le Creuset apologized to its cookware fans who were duped by the deepfake.  ""Le Creuset does not have any kind of partnership with Taylor Swift. That is a scam and we're working diligently to have those posts taken down,"" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. Swift does indeed appear to be a fan of the high-end cookware brand's wares. Le Creuset shared an image from Swift's Netflix documentary, ""Miss Americana,"" showing Swift in her kitchen using the brand's round dutch oven, which retails for up to $625. A representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.  To be sure, Swift isn't the only celebrity target of social media swindlers. As artificial intelligence technology becomes more sophisticated, these types of deepfake scams are on the rise, the Better Business Bureau warned last April.  ""Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account,"" the BBB said in a post. ""The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you'll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn't exist."" Actor Tom Hanks and CBS Mornings host Gayle King have both had their likenesses used to hawk products they don't endorse.  King reposted a fake weight loss-related video from a company called Artipet on her own Instagram account with a statement saying she is in no way affiliated with the company or alleged product, and warning her followers not to ""be fooled by these AI videos.""

,,Le Creuset Taylor Swift Giveaway Scam,"What do you get when you cross a premium cookware brand with the name and likeness of a music megastar? A classic giveaway scam. We’ve been tracking the Le Creuset Taylor Swift giveaway scam this week as it’s spread like wildfire across social media and multiple news outlets. Let’s dive in for the low-down. Scams and fake giveaways are common on social media platforms, especially Facebook. Scammers often use the names of popular celebrities or brands to trick people into losing their money or providing personal information, such as credit card details. In this case, AI-generated deepfake videos portray a fake Taylor Swift, who has supposedly teamed up with Le Creuset to commence a PR giveaway campaign. The AI woman states: “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here […] Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”

Needless to say, it is not true — there is no giveaway team-up between the two parties. It’s not known who is behind the scam, but “The most profitable shares” is one such Facebook page that has been spreading the scam. If you come across these ads or this page, stay away. There are red flags regarding this page: created just this month, no admin information, and no likes or followers. The page is clearly just a vehicle for spreading the scam. Below is another ad from the same page, this time just focusing on Le Creuset. If you have come across a giveaway that seems too good to be true, be skeptical. Legitimate giveaways are typically hosted on verified, official social media accounts of celebrities or brands. To be safe, you should check the official social media accounts of related parties for any announcements or promotions. In addition, be cautious when clicking on links, providing personal information, or making financial transactions. These scams are increasingly common, with the likes of Tom Hanks and Gayle King also targeted for deepfake videos. As the Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns: “Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account […] The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you’ll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn’t exist.” The truth is, there are lots of scams and scam sites on the internet and they’re getting even more difficult to detect with common sense alone.

To fully understand how this widespread scam works and identify red flags, here is a more in-depth walkthrough of the step-by-step process: The scam begins with promoted ads run on social platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. The ads include video clips apparently showing various celebrities casually speaking directly to the camera/audience. Thanks to advancements in deepfake technology, the videos appear incredibly realistic. The celebrity’s face, voice, mannerisms, and speech patterns are cloned almost flawlessly by the AI software. Absolutely nothing visually or audibly signals the videos are counterfeit.   In the forged videos, the celebrity explains they’re urgently giving away free Le Creuset products because of excess inventory they need to get rid of. Specific details include: Urgency and exclusivity tactics like this encourage social media users to immediately click through and claim the purported free products. When people click on the promo ads, they are redirected to pseudo news articles that appear at first glance to be from legitimate publications like People Magazine, Buzzfeed, and major news networks. However, the sites are complete fakes.   While cleverly designed, closer inspection reveals multiple red flags, including: The goal is tricking users into trusting the false information and celebrity endorsements being presented in the articles. These fake news stories provide additional background on the supposed excess Le Creuset inventory prompting the urgent giveaways. They include convincing quotes from the celebrities expressing excitement for fans to score free cookware thanks to the special product collaboration. Of course, all quotes are invented for the scam. The articles emphasize readers must act fast to claim their free sets before the limited supply is gone. A sense of urgency pushes victims to provide their information without deeper scrutiny that would reveal the scam. Near the bottom of the page, a prominent “Claim Yours Now!” button is presented along with text stating readers can obtain their free Le Creuset items with just a small $9.95 shipping and processing fee. In reality, this modest charge is a front for illegitimate recurring subscriptions being applied to user accounts without consent. When users click the “Claim Yours Now!” CTA buttons eager to score expensive free Le Creuset products, they are redirected to an online order form on a third-party website unaffiliated with any of the celebrities or brands involved. These fake promotion sites have vague names like “OnlineProductOffers”, “LimitedTimeGiveaways” or “DealsZone”. They continue the ruse by using Le Creuset branding and imagery along with urgent messaging about limited supply.   To finalize the order for their “free” items, users must fill out personal details including: They then must enter credit/debit card payment information so the $9.95 shipping costs can be processed to deliver the free products. An additional checkbox has users “agree” that they understand the single $9.95 charge to cover shipping and handling. Nowhere on the page is it revealed this activates an ongoing monthly subscription. That critical detail is buried deep in lengthy terms and conditions, knowing most people won’t read the fine print. As soon as users submit their info, their payment method is automatically enrolled in expensive recurring subscription charges without any further consent. Within 3-5 days of providing payment details, victims will experience the first fraudulent subscription withdrawal from their account for amounts like $89.95 or $99.95. These excessive fees are wholly unrelated to any supposed shipping charge. The shady websites apply monthly subscriptions using the collected user data and payment methods. The excessive monthly charges will continue indefinitely until identified and cancelled. Of course, users never receive any free Le Creuset products as promised initially. When defrauded users eventually notice the unauthorized activity on their accounts and contact customer service to complain, they experience more deception and stonewalling. The fraudsters operating the sites insist the monthly fees were clearly agreed to in initial fine print terms. Their tactics include: In the end, almost no users are able to recover lost funds or cancel these celebrity giveaway scams once their payment information has been compromised. The entire system is constructed to mislead at every stage. Now that you understand the step-by-step workings of the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam, here are key signs to recognize as potential red flags when encountering questionable offers online: Stay skeptical whenever you see urgent limited-time promotions, celebrity endorsements imploring you to act fast on social media, and legal jargon downplaying otherwise hidden costs. If an offer arouses suspicion, trust your judgement and avoid providing personal or payment details until legitimacy can be confirmed. The celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam is promoted heavily on Facebook. Here’s what to watch for: If you see these signs, report the content immediately. Do not engage or click on links as it could compromise your personal information with scammers. Here are red flags the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam is promoted on Instagram: Avoid sponsored celebrity giveaway promotions on Instagram. Report them as scam attempts to get the content removed ASAP. Here are signs the celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam is being promoted on TikTok: Never click on links from strangers on TikTok, especially involving celebrity endorsements of expensive free products. Report suspicious promoted giveaways immediately. If you entered any sensitive information or payment details in relation to a free celebrity Le Creuset promotion, here are the steps to take right away in attempting to address the situation: Step 1: Contact Your Bank Call your credit card company or bank immediately to report being scammed into an unwanted recurring subscription. Ask them to block any future associated charges. See if any fraudulent fees can be reversed or refunded depending on how long ago entered. Acting quickly is key for the best outcome. Provide transaction dates and merchant details. Step 2: Cancel Any Accounts Created If you created accounts on related scam websites, login and permanently delete or deactivate them. This removes stored payment data from their records, preventing continued billing. Also unsubscribe from any emails you may have signed up for in the process by clicking “opt-out” or “unsubscribe” links at the bottom. Step 3: Change Exposed Passwords Change any passwords you used on the fake promotion sites ASAP if they’re used elsewhere. Scammers can exploit password reuse to access more of your accounts. Enable two-factor authentication for additional security on sensitive logins. Step 4: Watch for Other Suspicious Charges Carefully monitor bank statements, credit reports, and all connected accounts over the next few months for any other unusual or unauthorized charges. Since scammers trade stolen information online, one scam can lead to more fraud down the line. Report any dubious activities immediately. Step 5: Report the Scam To help get scam sites shut down faster, file details of your experience with: Reporting scams reduces this content’s reach, preventing more victims. This is a fraudulent social media scam using deepfake videos of stars like Lainey Wilson, Ree Drummond, Taylor Swift, Oprah, Trisha Yearwood, and Martha Stewart announcing free Le Creuset giveaways. The fake promotions promise free cookware but instead force hidden monthly subscription fees on victims. Scammers use advanced deepfake technology to create realistic videos of celebrities that closely match their face, voice, speech patterns, and mannerisms. This tricks viewers into thinking the stars genuinely endorsed the promotions. Tactics include deepfake videos, fake urgency around limited-time offers, elaborate fake news websites, fine print concealing monthly fees, and refusal to issue refunds through deceptive “customer service” contacts. Users believing they will receive free Le Creuset products provide their information and a small $9.95 “shipping” payment. But within days, charges of $89+ from an unauthorized monthly subscription hit their accounts instead. Immediately call your bank to dispute the charges, cancel any accounts created on scam websites, monitor your statements for further fraud, change exposed passwords, and report the scam details to authorities and consumer protection agencies. Look for social media ads and websites urgently promoting free gifts or products using celebrity names, images, and videos. Especially beware of limited-time offers requiring upfront payment info. Verify authenticity directly on real brand sites before providing any data. Stay skeptical of social ads and websites promoting free high-ticket items from celebrities. Check URL spellings and quality of websites before entering info. Read all terms and conditions closely to identify recurring fees. Monitor accounts after providing payment details anywhere online. Report scam promotions to social media security teams, brand security departments, the FTC, BBB, IC3, and your local authorities. Reporting gets scam content removed faster to prevent more victims. No, the celebrity names, images, and deepfake videos are used completely without their consent. The scammers do this solely to deceitfully gain trust and trick users into providing their payment information. The celebrity Le Creuset giveaway scam preys on trusting social media users through deceptive ads, websites, and deepfake videos falsely claiming to offer free high-ticket products. But knowing what red flags to watch for makes it possible to identify and avoid. Here are key tips for staying safer online moving forward: Staying vigilant against fraud protects not only yourself, but others who may encounter risky offers promoted online or on social platforms. Share this guide to help more users avoid the celebrity Le Creuset cookware giveaway scam! Here are 10 basic security tips to help you avoid malware and protect your device: Use a good antivirus and keep it up-to-date. It's essential to use a good quality antivirus and keep it up-to-date to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. We are huge fans of Malwarebytes Premium and use it on all of our devices, including Windows and Mac computers as well as our mobile devices. Malwarebytes sits beside your traditional antivirus, filling in any gaps in its defenses, and providing extra protection against sneakier security threats. Keep software and operating systems up-to-date. Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Whenever an update is released for your device, download and install it right away. These updates often include security fixes, vulnerability patches, and other necessary maintenance. Be careful when installing programs and apps. Pay close attention to installation screens and license agreements when installing software. Custom or advanced installation options will often disclose any third-party software that is also being installed. Take great care in every stage of the process and make sure you know what it is you're agreeing to before you click ""Next."" Install an ad blocker. Use a browser-based content blocker, like AdGuard. Content blockers help stop malicious ads, Trojans, phishing, and other undesirable content that an antivirus product alone may not stop. Be careful what you download. A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. Be alert for people trying to trick you. Whether it's your email, phone, messenger, or other applications, always be alert and on guard for someone trying to trick you into clicking on links or replying to messages. Remember that it's easy to spoof phone numbers, so a familiar name or number doesn't make messages more trustworthy. Back up your data. Back up your data frequently and check that your backup data can be restored. You can do this manually on an external HDD/USB stick, or automatically using backup software. This is also the best way to counter ransomware. Never connect the backup drive to a computer if you suspect that the computer is infected with malware. Choose strong passwords. Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don't use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it's important to follow these 10 basic safety rules. By doing so, you can protect yourself from many of the unpleasant surprises that can arise when using the web.

,,Taylor Swift deepfake used for Le Creuset giveaway scam,"Taylor Swift is not giving out free Le Creuset products in social media advertisements — though deepfakes of her voice would like you to believe otherwise. A series of posts have recently surfaced on TikTok and in Meta's Ad Library claiming to show Swift offering free Le Creuset cookware sets, the New York Times reports. The ads featured clips where Swift was near Le Creuset products and used a synthetic version of her voice. The scammers used AI to have the cloned voice address her fans, ""Swifties,"" and produce other little remarks. These posts led interested parties to fake versions of sites like The Food Network with made-up articles and testimonials about Le Creuset. Shoppers were then asked just to provide the $9.96 for shipping to get their free products. Unsurprisingly, no Dutch ovens arrived, and customers had additional monthly charges added to their cards. Le Creuset confirmed no such giveaway was occurring. Swift is hardly the only celebrity who has recently found their voice co-opted using AI. She's not even the only one used in the scam, with interior designer Joanna Gaines mimicked in ads from verified accounts or ones labeled as sponsored posts. In April 2023, the Better Business Bureau warned consumers about the high quality of ads featuring AI-manufactured versions of celebrities. Since then, scammers have used deepfakes to convince consumers that Luke Combs was selling weight loss gummies, Tom Hanks was promoting dental plans and Gayle King was selling other weight loss products, to name a few examples. Little regulation exists for monitoring deepfakes or punishing the people who create them. A lot of the responsibility currently falls on the platforms, with YouTube, for example, laying out new steps for reporting deepfakes. At the same time, its working with select musicians to loan their voices out and create greater interest in AI-generated versions of real people. Last year, two bills were introduced in Congress to address deepfakes: The No Fakes Act and the Deepfakes Accountability Act. However, the fate of both pieces of legislation is uncertain. At the moment, only select states, such as California and Florida, have any AI regulation.

,,Taylor Swift Fans Warned Against Le Creuset Scam,"Taylor Swift fans should be cautious as a new scam is floating around the internet, and it targets those looking to participate in Swift's giveaway. Scammers use various techniques to get personal or financial information from users, and AI-infused celebrity deep-fakes are increasingly popular. The fraudulent online campaign claims that Swift collaborated with Le Creuset to offer free cookware, but instead it takes you to external sites stealing your data and your money. Newsweek reached out to Swift's publicist via email for comment. Hackers are using Swift's and Le Creuse's names to gain trust, so people will click on the link. ""These types of celebrity giveaway scams are so nefarious because they relay on the trust the public has on the celebrity image that they are hijacking,"" Joseph Jones, the president of Bosco Legal and Investigation Services, told Newsweek. ""In this case, Taylor Swift fans jumped on the opportunity to become associated with the celebrity via this promotional deal."" The scam happens most frequently on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, according to MalwareTips, and it's likely to feature a convincing AI video seemingly showing Swift explaining the deal with the free cookware sets if you enter your information in time. ""Hey guys, Taylor Swift here with some exciting news!"" a simulation of Swift is shown to be saying in the video. ""To celebrate the holidays and thank my amazing fans this year, I've teamed up with Le Creuset to give away some of their gorgeous Dutch ovens totally free."" Swift then is shown asking fans to follow a link and pay a $10 shipping fee to get the cookware set. Instead, fans will be tricked into phishing websites that steal your information. Hidden subscription clauses in the $10 sale allow the scammers to take $100-plus monthly charges from your account, and no cookware will be delivered. ""Deep-fake technology has steadily been a growing concern over the past couple of years,"" David Derigiotis, the chief insurance officer for Embroker and author of Parental Advisory: How to Protect Your Family in the Digital Age of Identity Theft & Data Breaches, told Newsweek. ""The availability of these programs along with improvements to the video and sound quality make them an ideal tool for criminals. Trust is the name of the game when it comes to scams, and wrongfully using the image of popular celebrities or influencers can be the perfect weapon for stealing sensitive information and money from unsuspecting consumers."" It's an especially convincing scam considering clicking on the link can take you to a ""foxlifestyleoffers.com"" page, which shows fake news articles about the giveaway seemingly from Fox and People magazine. As a result, would-be scam victims are more likely to share their personal data by believing it's legitimate. According to experts, scams like this are so nefarious and convincing for a few reasons. ""Taylor Swift fans were more interested in becoming a part of the giveaway than looking out for the red flags that they normally spot when doing online shopping,"" Jones said. ""The limited giveaway number, the sense of urgency, and the affordability were enough to entice people to fall for the scam."" Telling users there were ""only a few left"" and showing fake customer reviews made it easy for fans to not think it through before handing over their credit card information. Sites even show a Taylor Swift quote in which she appears to say: ""I can't wait to see fans unboxing their very own Le Creuset Dutch ovens on TikTok this holiday season after entering my biggest giveaway ever."" The deep-fake Swift scam was across Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn leading up to the holidays, and many victims were unsure what to do after they shared their financial information. Whenever you believe you're the victim of a scam, you should immediately contact your payment providers and banking institution saying they were scam payments. In some cases, the bank can dispute a fraud charge and provide you reimbursement. To stop the recurring payments every month, you might also need to contact the customer service numbers listed under the scam. You will need to be clear that you revoke your payment authorization and record any confirmation details in case the charges continue. You also should update all your passwords and potentially sign up for a credit monitoring or bureau fraud alert system to keep track of any suspicious activity on your account. You can also file a complaint to government and third-party protection groups so the scammers are less likely to strike again. If you don't take these steps, it's likely you could fall victim to financial plunging or even identity theft, Jones said. The Swift scam is just one of many, so internet users should know what to look out for before deciding to click on any link. For one, before you click on anything, you should verify a celebrity claim or social media offer through unbiased third-party research. And when paying for anything online, always make sure you read the terms and conditions along with any extra clauses that might be hiding in plain sight. ""The joy that people get from winning, scoring a deal, hitting the jackpot or becoming a part of an exclusive club is intoxicating,"" Jones said. ""The best advice for those to avoid being scammed is to remember that their financial future trumps any short-term win."" In general, you should install an anti-virus software to block scam attempts like these from popping up. You should also be careful when installing new apps and read through the entire licensing agreement before you hit ""install.""     Suzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

,,"Beware Taylor Swift, the AI edition: The singer is not giving away free Le Creuset cookware","AI-generated fake advertisements are making the rounds on social media again, this time using the voice and likeness of Taylor Swift promising free Le Creuset cookware sets. As any proper Swiftie knows, the “Hoax” singer is fan of Le Creuset. In the pop star’s 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” she whipped up some pasta sauce in the brand’s blue dutch oven. And back in 2014, Swift surprised “superfan” Gena Gabrielle by attending her bridal shower with several gifts in tow, including two items from the luxury cookware line. Scammers used artificial intelligence technology to craft a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The audio was played over various images of Le Creuset products and clips of Swift, some lifted from her 2016 interview with Vogue, “73 Questions with Taylor Swift,” in which the Grammy winner gives the outlet a tour of her home while answering rapid-fire questions. ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS  April 14, 2014 In multiple social media ads, Swift’s voice is manipulated to sound as though she’s “thrilled” to be giving away to her “loyal fans” free cookware sets that are available due to a “packaging error.” Fans need only to offer up their personal information and pay a $9.96 shipping fee. A spokesperson for Le Creuset told The Times in a statement that the brand is not not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts,” the statement said. “Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Representative for Swift did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  July 8, 2023 Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it easier to create deepfakes and convincing celebrity audio clips. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo, told the New York Times. Lyu added it could take less than 45 minutes to make a “decent-quality video.” Lyu continued that the fake Le Creuset giveaway was likely created using a text-to-speech service, which can translate a script into an A.I.-generated voice, and then paired with a video using a lip-syncing software. Last June, “Yellowstone” star and country musician Lainey Wilson saw her voice and likeness used by scammers to peddle weight-loss gummies. The “Heart Like a Truck” hitmaker shared a video on Instagram slamming the fake ads. MUSIC  Oct. 28, 2022 “By now I’m sure a lot of y’all have seen some ads about me losing weight, being hospitalized, and then I started taking some weight loss gummies and blah blah blah, they saved my life well surprise — it ain’t true,” she said. “People will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it’s lies because ain’t nobody sent me any gummies ... I love y’all. I just don’t want y’all spending your money on something that ain’t real, do not fall for it.” And in September, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks appeared in deepfake dental advertisements. The “Asteroid City” star quickly shot them down via his Instagram, sharing a still from the scam video with the caption, “Beware! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it.” COMPANY TOWN  Oct. 2, 2023 Last year, when a sharp uptick in fake celebrity ads began plaguing the internet, USA Today shared a guide for spotting AI-generated videos that explained red flags to look out for, including perfect symmetry, distortion, unusual proportions and unnatural textures.

,,Taylor Swift video altered in bogus Le Creuset giveaway ads,"""I got some exciting news to share! I have teamed up with Lé Creuset for another epic gift-away - But this time we're giving away FREE 20 piece cookware sets!"" said a January 2, 2024 Facebook post sharing a video of Swift, which has since been removed. In the clip, the singer appeared to say: ""Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So, I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."" Meta's Ad Library shows multiple posts featuring the pop superstar have circulated on Facebook since late December. Cookware sets from Le Creuset retail for more than $1,000, making the possibility of a freebee attractive. But the link in the post for ""Taylor Swift's BIG New Year Giveaway"" led to an unrelated website. Other posts link to a supposed Food Network article about the promotion. However, AFP found no such article on the cable channel's website -- and a spokesperson said the promotion is ""in no way connected to the Food Network brand."" Links in the fake article lead to a series of survey questions requesting personal information and a payment that supposedly covers shipping costs for the ""free"" product. Asked about the ads, the French cookware company told AFP: ""Le Creuset has never partnered with Taylor Swift for any partnership to offer gifts to consumers."" Le Creuset does use social media to offer giveaways (archived here), but it said all promotions will come from official, verified profiles. ""It is always advisable to check the official Le Creuset social accounts and website before clicking on a suspicious ad,"" the company said in a French statement. A keyword search for ""Le Creuset giveaway"" on Facebook surfaced more offers for free cookware purportedly sponsored by Oprah Winfrey, country music star Trisha Yearwood and US television hosts Joanna and Chip Gaines. ""This is a scam,"" said Katie Keil, director of public relations at Magnolia, the lifestyle company founded by the Gaines. In a January 16 email, she told AFP the company did not permit the use of Joanna or Chip Gaines's likeness in the ads -- and that the couple does ""not have a sponsorship deal"" with Le Creuset. Meta's Ad Library shows other alleged offers from singers Selena Gomez, Lainey Wilson and Miranda Lambert -- as well as blogger Ree Drummond, known as the Pioneer Woman. The videos claim the cookware is free due to a ""packaging error."" AFP contacted representatives for Swift and other celebrities for comment, but responses were not forthcoming. The US Better Business Bureau warns consumers that artificial intelligence (AI) has led to an increase in accounts using celebrity impersonations to promote unaffiliated products. Cybersecurity firm McAfee said January 10 on X that it had confirmed the video of Swift was a ""deepfake scam generated through AI"" (archived here). The New York Times reported the clips were likely created using an AI text-to-speech tool. The ads contain several other clues that they are inauthentic: AFP previously reported news anchors in several countries have seen their likenesses used in AI-generated ads promoting spurious offers. AFP has also debunked investment schemes falsely linked to Elon Musk. Follow us       ",factcheck.afp.com,https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34EF34Q,"Copyright © AFP 2017-2024.

,,Taylor Swift fans scammed after fake AI Le Creuset cookware endorsement goes viral," These scammers are gonna be on the receiving end of some bad “Karma.” Several die-hard Taylor Swift fans have been reportedly scammed out of hundreds of dollars after tricksters released advertisements employing AI-generated video of the Grammy winner peddling Le Creuset in an attempt to steal money and data from fans. The ads — which can be found across all social media platforms — show Swift, 34, standing next to the Le Creuset Dutch oven, which, according to the official website, runs anywhere from $180 to $750 depending on the size and style. According to a report by the New York Times, the fake Swift tells fans that she is “thrilled” to be giving away free sets of the expensive cookware, but only if they click on a link and answer a few questions. The report reveals that several participants were sent to what seemed like legitimate websites populated with several fake reviews and coverage. The website then asks hopeful buyers to fork over a “small shipping fee of $9.96.” Buyers are then unknowingly hit with recurring charges without ever actually receiving the pot. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” computer science professor Siwei Lyu told the Times of the computer-rendered Swift video. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” According to Lyu, the ad copy was likely derived from a text-to-speech platform. While Swift has spoken about her love for the brand, which sells top-of-the-line cookware of basics such as round Dutch ovens, a demi teakettle and cast iron skillets, the “Red” songstress has never officially endorsed Le Creuset. Swift is the latest of several celebrities to be impersonated by AI. Last month, the voice-cloning startup Respeecher managed to re-create the voice of Hollywood legend Jimmy Stewart by employing a voice actor to mimic the late actor’s style of speech. The voice of Stewart, who gained notoriety for films such as “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Rear Window,” appears on the app in a premium story called “It’s a Wonderful Sleep Story,” billed as a “heartwarming new holiday tale” on the Calm app. The Post also previously reported that Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks have fallen victim to AI voice-cloning without their permission. Johansson officially took legal action in November after an artificial intelligence app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar used the actress’ face and voice in an advertisement. “We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have,” the “Avengers” star’s’ attorney told Variety at the time. Hanks took to his Instagram in October to warn fans that he was not peddling a dental plan when a video using his likeness emerged. “Beware!!” Hanks, 67, wrote beneath a photo of his lookalike. “There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me.” “I have nothing to do with it,” the “Forrest Gump” star added.

,,Swifty Scam: Taylor Swift Is Not Giving Away Le Creuset Cookware," Is Taylor Swift really giving away Le Creuset cookware? No, it’s a scam. Recently, the singer’s likeness has appeared in AI-generated advertisements promoting free giveaways of Le Creuset cookware. According to multiple outlets, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have had the ad appear in recent weeks. The fake advertisements for the cookware brand use pieced-together clips of the singer with a synthesized version of her voice and images of Le Creuset Dutch ovens. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” a fake advertisement featuring Swift’s augmented voice begins. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” Then, the ad instructs people to click on a button and answer questions in order to receive the brand’s cookware. The false advertisement using Taylor Swift’s voice included different ways that the creators of the fake ad used to legitimize the so-called giveaway. “Get in 10 days! Long waiting but anyway the set is great! Thank you guys!!” one account commented. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” a spokesperson for Le Creuset told NBC News. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Many people were quick to call out the scam. Some people even shared their experience of falling for the fake advertisement. “I paid the shipping, stupidly, and never received the cookware,” one user commented. “Shame on me for falling for it. Don’t do it!” The NY Times reported that the Le Creuset scam campaign also featured fabricated versions of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey. In 2022, Winfrey shared a video about the prevalence of fake social media ads, emails, and websites falsely claiming that she endorsed weight loss gummies. A Meta spokesperson told TODAY.com that the ad has been removed from their platforms. Of course, with anything on the internet, does it truly go away? Check out the fake ad here. Best Buy has announced that starting in 2024, following this holiday season, they will discontinue the sale of DVDs, Blu-rays, and 4K Ultra HD discs, both in their physical stores and online. They have said the reason for this decision is due to the increasing popularity of streaming services.  This move aligns with the prevailing trend, as more people turn to streaming for their entertainment needs. Physical media does come with certain inconveniences, such as taking up space and limited mobile accessibility. But there are still people who appreciate the more traditional way of enjoying movies and music. There are some advantages of owning Blu-rays and DVDs. These include owning what you buy and having bonus content you can’t get anywhere else. In the ’90s, owning a pager was considered a status symbol and a fashion statement. Today, it’s even possible to purchase a fully functional vintage Motorola pager from online marketplaces like eBay. With the widespread use of mobile phones and free calling applications that offer unlimited calls via Wi-Fi, traditional landlines may eventually become obsolete. However, the complete phasing out of this technology may take some time. This is because certain regions or countries still contend with unreliable internet or cellular coverage. As of August 2023, Community Phone reports that approximately 40.35 million households in the United States still maintain landline phones, and 38.1 million households have both a landline and a cell phone. For some people, “new” technology doesn’t always mean “better.” On Reddit, a user started a discussion thread asking, “What outdated or obsolete tech are you still using and are perfectly happy with?” The thread received more than 16,000 responses from people who shared the outdated everyday items they still happily use. Check some of them out below. You probably haven’t seen a calculator in ages, but a Reddit user chimed in to say that, for them, the old-school scientific calculator beats the one on your phone or any app. They simply put it like this, “Honestly, a standard scientific calculator is just easier to use than your phone’s built-in scientific calculator.” It could be the fun button-tapping sound or the nostalgic thrill of typing in cheeky words with numbers that makes this person prefer calculators. Kanizphoto/ Getty Images Smartwatches may pack in loads of features, but there’s a catch – they need regular charging and maintenance, and their battery life is shorter. On the flip side, traditional watches are a low-maintenance choice with longer battery life. In fact, a Redditor mentioned they still rock a “a lovely, inexpensive, bombproof, analog, big face Casio.” They also pointed out that smartwatches aren’t allowed at their job, so their trusty Casio gets the job done. popovaphoto/ Getty Images If you’ve put a ton of effort into collecting CDs and vinyl records, and creating some killer playlists, why ditch them, right? One person told their story about growing up in the ’90s, building a massive CD collection, and stashing them all in one of those Case Logic CD binders. They fondly shared, “I still keep it with me in my car and it’s a wonderful trip down memory lane every time I open it. I laughed and cried a little when my kids friend asked me what it was and I said, ‘CDs’ and they followed up with, ‘What’s that?'” But also: not everything is available on streaming services.  That obscure soundtrack or tribute album from the ’80s? Licensing issues may have prevented it from hitting the streamers.  Love Joni Mitchell? Well, Spotify doesn’t have her catalog. Sure, you can subscribe to another service, but if you kept your old vinyl and have a turntable, you can listen to it the old school way. IngaNielsen/ Getty Images You have people who can’t stand a tangle of wires in their tech setup, and then there’s that Reddit user who’s all about the wired life. They firmly believe that wired networking is “not obsolete or outdated.” According to them, it’s superior in every aspect, except for the mobility it lacks compared to wireless. They put it simply, “Wired is the ideal, you only go wireless if running cable is unfeasible for the situation. Diana Sand/ Getty Images A regular doorbell does its job well. It lets you know someone’s at the door. On the other hand, a video doorbell does the same but with the perk of letting you see and hear the person at your door, even if you’re not home. Someone mentioned they’d be up for a smart doorbell if it kept the data local. They said, “I don’t want anything being sent online, so I might need to set up my own system… I’ll just stick with the traditional kind.” eurobanks/ Getty Images A Redditor shared their affection for good old physical buttons, arguing that not everything needs to go the touchscreen route. They stressed the importance of having car radios equipped with buttons rather than screens, believing it’s a safer choice. They explained, “It’s easier for me to push a button to change the music while keeping my eyes on the road/ I can’t do that if my car has a screen. It increases distracted driving incidents.” Supersmario/ Getty Images  Download the app to LISTEN LIVE wherever you are and connect with us like never before!

,,Taylor Swift Fans Were Scammed By AI-Generated Le Creuset Ads,"AI was the mastermind. While the real Taylor Swift would never steer us wrong, her evil twin (read: an AI-generated avatar created by con artists) absolutely would. According to The New York Times, unidentified scammers used artificial intelligence and Taylor Swift's likeness to endorse a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway to steal money and data. Though Taylor is, indeed, a fan of Le Creuset, she has no formal deal with the luxury cookware brand despite how it appeared in online videos. The outlet reports that the fake promotional videos featured an uncanny Swift lookalike that was created with AI technology to replicate her appearance and voice. ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here,"" the AI Swift said in the ad. ""Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."" Users were encouraged to click a button on the ad and complete a short survey. They were redirected to legit-seeming websites like The Food Network with fake testimonials on the products, Page Six reports. And while we don't know who exactly is behind the con, a Facebook account titled ""The most profitable shares"" posted the Swift scam to its page. Swift's reps have yet to comment on the scandal, however, Le Creuset has released a statement of its own: ""Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."" Just last month, the Better Business Bureau warned the public about these highly-convincing deepfake scams. ""Scammers use deepfake technology to trick people. They take real video clips and photos of a person and use them to create new videos and audio clips. Deepfake images and videos can be surprisingly realistic,"" the BBB warned in a statement. ""Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account. The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you'll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn't exist."" Tom Hanks and CBS Mornings host Gayle King have similarly been used in AI scams, per CBS. According to the outlet, King recently shared a statement to her Instagram account denying claims she is affiliated with the fake weight loss ads circulating the internet with her likeness and told followers not to ""be fooled by these AI videos.""

,,Taylor Swift is the latest star to be targeted by fraudsters who have created a deep fake advert of her promoting Le Creuset cookware to scam 'Swifties' out of money,"PUBLISHED: 06:03 EST, 11 January 2024 | UPDATED: 09:22 EST, 12 January 2024  42 View
comments    Fraudsters created a deepfake ad using Taylor Swift's likeness in a bid to scam her fans out of money.  The AI-generated ad, which had been circulating online earlier this month, promoted a non-existent giveaway between the popstar and Le Creuset cookware. The advert featured a synthetic version of Swift's voice, spliced with footage of her and Le Creuset dutch ovens, saying: 'Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free.' Customers who clicked on the ad, which has since been removed from Facebook, would then be directed to websites mimicking popular homegoods platforms like Food Network, according to the New York Times. Sweepstakes participants would then be asked to pay a 'small shipping fee of $9.96' to receive their free cookware. After providing payment, consumers were reportedly hit with monthly charges and never received the cooking set. Le Creuset said that it is not collaborating with Swift, 34, on any consumer giveaways and encouraged shoppers to get its official social media accounts before clicking on adverts.

The AI -generated ad, which had been circulating on Facebook earlier this month, promoted a non-existent giveaway between the popstar and Le Creuset cookware Taylor Swift is known to have an affinity for the high-end cookware brand. Le Crueset shared a photo of her cooking on its Facebook page in 2020 noting how its dutch ovens made a cameo appearance (pictured) in her Netflix documentary Miss Americana Actress Jamie King (not pictured) also gifted Swift a Le Creuset set as a housewarming gift in 2014, according to the cookware brand The ad appears to have originally been posted on a Facebook page titled The most profitable shares. The deepfaked version of Swift told 'Swifties', the phrase used to describe her fans, that she was 'thrilled' to be giving away free Le Creuset sets. After announcing the giveaway, the AI-generated Swift directed viewers to complete immediately complete a survey to collect their prize, noting that 'supplies are running out'. The ad had amassed around 2,300 views before it was taken off down. A spokesperson for Meta, the platform's parent company, confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that it had removed the ad.  Le Creuset denied any affiliation with the promotion, telling MailOnline: 'Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. 'All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset's official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.' AI experts believe the ad was likely created using a text-to-speech service that translates a script into a synthetic voice. The faked audio can then be incorporated into already existing video clips using lip-syncing programs. There is no suggestion that Swift is linked to the ad in any way. The Anti-Hero singer is pictured arriving for dinner at hotspot Lucali in Brooklyn, New York City on Wednesday 'These tools are becoming very accessible these days,' Dr Siwei Lu, a computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, told the New York Times. 'It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.' Dr Lu added that AI technology allows users to create a 'decent-quality video' in under 45 minutes. There is no suggestion that Swift is linked to the ad in any way despite the Anti-Hero singer being known to have an affinity for the high-end cookware brand.  Actress Jamie King gifted Swift a Le Creuset set as a housewarming gift in 2014. The singer was also seen in a kitchen using the brand's wares in her Netflix documentary Miss Americana (2020). Meta and a spokesperson for Swift did not immediately respond to MailOnline's requests for comment.  Swift is the latest celebrity to be targeted by a deep fake ad. Last October, actor Tom Hanks warned his social media followers that his likeness was being used to promote 'some dental plan' that he had 'nothing to do with'. TV personality Gayle King made a similar post one day after Hanks warning her fans that an AI deep fake had been created to promote a hawk product that she was not endorsing. The fraudsters used a recent video that King had posted to promote her radio show, but dubbed it over with synthetic audio. The TV star told her followers 'not to be fooled' by the ad.

The spread of misinformation was named as the biggest risk for the next two years according to a poll of 1,400 business leaders and experts.

,,Taylor Swift’s strange Le Creuset giveaway confirmed as AI scam,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.  Deepfakes are getting weirder. This latest AI scandal might be the most absurd I've seen so far. In a recent ad circulating on social media, popstar Taylor Swift was seen promoting a giveaway for Le Creuset cookware – a collaboration that the brand has since denied. While AI can help improve our lives, rapid artificial intelligence advancements also allow deepfake scams to become increasingly sophisticated. So to clarify, no, that wasn't Taylor flogging a few spare casserole dishes, it was a deceptive (and slightly ridiculous) AI scam. McAfee Advisory! No, That’s Not Taylor Swift Promoting Le Creuset Cookware.If you see this video in your social media feed, we can confirm that it is a #deepfake scam generated through #AI.McAfee's Project Mockingbird technology announced at #CES2024, is designed to empower… pic.twitter.com/aVpcjI0PgkJanuary 10, 2024 With a crafty blend of deepfake technology, old footage and text-to-speech software, the fraudulent ads produced a somewhat convincing result that could easily deceive an unsuspecting fan. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,"" the fake Taylor says in a monotonous voice. ""Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free,” she adds.  While it might seem strange, it's not a completely far-fetched collaboration, as Swift previously flexed her Le Creuset crockpot in the Miss Americana documentary. She's also not shy of a brand collaboration, previously partnering with companies like CoverGirl and Coca-Cola. While those of us who are more familiar with AI-generated content might identify the video's robotic twinge, these scams aim to play on vulnerable fans, scamming them for money with a Swiftie facade.  With Meta's celebrity AI chatbots blurring the lines between celebs and the public, it feels like we're edging closer to a parasocial crisis, creating an environment ripe for fraudulent scams. At least now that the Swift scam has been debunked we can see the more ridiculous side.

The ad claimed that Swift was giving away Le Creuset cookware.","  BY EMILY RELLA • JAN 11, 2024 Share Though it seems like Taylor Swift is everywhere — she was named the 2023 Time Magazine Person of the Year, after all — one place we didn't expect to see her name was touting a new collection of cookware. Fake advertisements using AI technology began surfacing on social media platforms last week, with the singer's likeness telling fans she was working with the famed cookware brand, Le Creuset, to give away Dutch ovens. ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free,"" the fake Swift says in one of the Facebook advertisements, which then prompts viewers to begin a questionnaire and pay for shipping.

As any proper Swiftie knows, the Hoax singer is a fan of Le Creuset. In the pop star's 2020 documentary Miss Americana, she whipped up some pasta sauce in the brand's blue dutch oven. And back in 2014, Swift surprised ""superfan"" Gena Gabrielle by attending her bridal shower with several gifts in tow, including two items from the luxury cookware line. Scammers used artificial intelligence technology to craft a synthetic version of the singer's voice, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

,,Taylor Swift fans scammed by fake Le Creuset endorsement," These fraudsters need a “Getaway Car.” Scammers created AI-generated advertisements of what looked and sounded like Taylor Swift hawking Le Creuset to steal data and money from Swifties, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. The “Cruel Summer” singer, 34, is a longtime fan of the luxury cookware brand; its Round Dutch Oven, Demi Teakettle and Cast Iron Skillet (among other items) all have places of pride in her kitchen. However, she has not officially endorsed Le Creuset and was not involved in any way with the forged ads that have been popping up on Facebook, TikTok and other sites in recent weeks. Experts told the outlet that artificial intelligence technology was used to help create a manufactured version of the Grammy winner’s voice, which was then paired with deepfake video of the star next to footage of Le Creuset dutch ovens to create the convincing ad. The French-Belgian brand’s dutch oven can cost anywhere from $180 to $750 depending on the size and style of the dish. In the fake ads, Swift’s synthetic voice called on “Swifties” and announced that she was “thrilled” to be giving away free cookware sets. The ad then prompted her fans to click a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day. Participants were sent to websites that appeared to be legitimate sites, like the Food Network, and showed fake news coverage of the product along with testimonials by fabricated customers, the New York Times reported. Hopeful shoppers were then asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware, without realizing that they were getting duped and would face a hidden monthly charge and never receive a posh pot in the mail. For more Page Six you love… Computer science professor Dr. Siwei Lyu told the newspaper that the con was most likely accomplished using a text-to-speech service. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Dr. Lyu said, adding that it takes less than 45 minutes to create a “decent-quality” video. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” Other stars were also reportedly wrapped up in the scheme including interior designer Joanna Gaines, country singer Lainey Wilson and lifestyle blogger Ree Drummond. Le Creuset told the Times they had no partnership with Swift and urged buyers to only shop their product from their official accounts or website. The company also warned consumers against clicking on suspicious ads. The pop star’s rep did not immediately return Page Six’s request for comment.

promoting free cookware on platforms like Facebook knew the ads were trouble before they clicked in. Get info without
leaving the page. Fake advertisements for the cookware brand Le Creuset, appearing to feature Swift’s stamp of approval, have appeared on Facebook and other social platforms in recent weeks. The advertisements use strewn-together clips of the singer with a synthesized version of her voice and images of Le Creuset Dutch ovens. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” a fake advertisement featuring Swift’s augmented voice begins. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” The ad then instructs users to click on a button and answer questions in order to receive the brand’s free cookware. The comments section of the Facebook post featuring Swift’s voice highlighted the various methods that the creators of the false ad used to legitimize the “giveaway.” “Get in 10 days! Long waiting but anyway the set is great! Thank you guys!!” one account commented. But other users were quick to jump in and call out the advertisement for being false while also sharing their experience with falling for the advertisement. “I paid the shipping, stupidly, and never received the cookware,” one user commented. “Shame on me for falling for it. Don’t do it!” Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesperson for Meta tells TODAY.com that the ad has been removed. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” a spokesperson for Le Creuset told NBC News. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Dr. David S. Touretzky, a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Science Department & Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Institute, tells TODAY.com that the Le Creuset scam only faked Taylor Swift’s voice. “The images it used were real,” he explains. “Faking images is possible but requires a lot more work.” The fake Le Creuset advertisement is far from the first to use artificial intelligence to fake a celebrity’s face or voice for scamming purposes. Similar scam ads on Facebook show Oprah Winfrey also promoting the cookware giveaway. In November 2023, Scarlett Johansson and her legal team went after Lisa AI, an AI art generator and avatar maker, for using her likeness for online advertisements. As troubling as these campaigns can be, Touretzky underscores that before deepfakes arrived, people would hire voice impersonators to pull off similar scams. “But finding people who could both do that well and were willing to facilitate a crime might be difficult. Using computers is easier because they have no morals and won’t rat you out to the authorities,” he continues. Touretzky explains that in order to fake someone’s voice, samples of their speech need to be collected. With Taylor Swift having been everywhere this year, bad actors certainly had plenty of content to pull from. “You use this as training data for a machine learning algorithm that builds a model of their speech patterns: their pronunciation, intonation, voice timbre, speaking rhythm,” he explains. “Using that model, you can take speech from someone else and transform it so that it sounds like the person you’re trying to imitate.” Touretzky notes that there’s no rewinding the clock on deepfake technology. “The technology isn't going back in the bottle,” he says. “If anything, as computers get more powerful, it will become even more widespread. Maybe in a year or two, you’ll be able to get an app for your phone that lets you speak like Morgan Freeman or Dame Judi Dench. “Catching people who misuse the technology will have to rely on better ability to trace where the money goes,” he says.

,,Watch: Taylor Swift used in deepfake Le Creuset ad,"Celebrity's image is used in AI-generated deepfake video endorsing a fake 'giveaway' Taylor Swift’s image has been used in an AI-generated deepfake scam video endorsing a fake Le Creuset cookware “giveaway”.  A video being shared across various social media platforms purports to show the singer urging her fans to hand over their bank details for a chance to win one of 3,000 cookware sets. In the deepfake clip using Swift’s likeness, the AI-generated voice says: “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free. “If you’re seeing this ad, you can get a free cookware set today – but just a heads-up, there are a few rules.” The voice says fans should submit details in a form below the video. They are then directed to a website where they are asked to provide a “small shipping fee of $9.96 (£7.82)”. However, the New York Times reports that those who gave over their card details were then hit with recurring charges. “These will only be given out until the end of the day today so don’t hesitate,” the AI-generated Swift adds. Several clips of the singer taken from a 2016 video interview with Vogue play throughout the bogus advert, alongside various images of Le Creuset products. Fans are urged to act quickly as “supplies are limited”. The video then adds: “Thank you guys, for all your support.” Swift, 34, is a known fan of the cookware brand, which appears in documentary scenes filmed at her home. In 2014, the popstar surprised a fan, Gena Gabrielle, by attending her bridal shower – bringing with her two Le Creuset items as gifts. A spokesman for Le Creuset confirmed there was no giveaway promotion with Swift.  They added: “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts.” It is unknown who is behind the scam, which has been posted across several Facebook groups before being rapidly deleted. Text-to-speech platforms can allow criminal gangs to create deepfake videos quickly and cheaply.  These services can translate a script into an AI-generated voice, and then pair the vocals with a video using lip-syncing software. In Britain, one in 12 have already been targeted by cybercriminals impersonating their loved ones in this way, according to a study by McAfee, the software company, with 77pc of all victims losing money as a result. A survey by the company found 95pc of people were unable to tell a fake AI-generated voice from a real one.  Last year, fraudsters used an AI–generated deepfake video of trusted consumer champion Martin Lewis to convince victims to part with their money.

,,Le Creuset giveaway scam tricks “Swifties” and “Selenators”,"Bad actors are using the Le Creuset giveaway scam to trick people into giving their credit card information. How do they do that? Of course, by using celebrity identities to trick people into believing that the Le Creuset giveaway scam is legit. However, it is not. Have you heard about the latest scam sweeping the internet? It’s all about a fake giveaway of Le Creuset cookware, and guess what? It’s got Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez’s names all over it! But, before you get too excited, let us tell you, it’s a big, fat scam. Yep, you heard it right. These clever tricksters have been using AI to make videos that look and sound just like our beloved celebs. They’re saying things like, “I’m so excited to give away free Le Creuset sets!” But here’s the catch: it’s all a lie. These videos popped up all over Meta (the folks behind Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok. And they look so real! But, the real kicker? They’re not just using Taylor and Selena’s faces. They’re deepfaking them. That’s a fancy way of saying they’re using high-tech AI to copy their voices, facial expressions, and even the way they talk. And boy, does it look convincing. Now, these sneaky ads have links that take you to websites that seem totally legit. They look like they’re from the Food Network or other big names in the news world. They lure you in with promises of “free” Le Creuset goodies for just a tiny shipping fee of $9.96. But here’s where it gets nasty. People who tried to get their free set ended up with no cookware. Instead, they got slapped with an $89.95 monthly subscription on top of that “shipping” fee. The main victims of this scam? Fans of celebrities. These fake ads are all over social media, targeting fans of Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and others, says Engadget. They show videos of these stars saying they’re giving away Le Creuset products for free. But remember, it’s all a setup. The list of impersonated stars includes: Top 18 deepfake AI tools that will blow your mind No, the Le Creuset giveaway is not legit. Bad actors from some parts of the world are using AI-generated deepfake videos of your favorite singer and actors to trick you into giving them your credit card information. Please be cautious against these kinds of scam attempts, as they are certainly not legit. Deepfakes are a big deal in the tech world. They use high-end AI to create videos or audio that mimic real people. It’s like digital copying but very advanced. The AI studies how someone talks and moves then make a video where it looks like that person is doing something they never really did. It’s hard to tell them apart from real videos; they’re becoming more common. Deepfakes, like this cookware giveaway, can be used for harmless jokes or serious scams. As the technology improves, it’s getting tougher to spot the fakes. Rashmika Mandanna deepfake viral video controversy explained So, what can you do to stay safe from these scams? First, be wary of offers that seem unreal. If a famous person is apparently giving away expensive items for nothing, it’s likely a scam. Do some checking. Look at the celebrity’s or brand’s real social media. If there’s a genuine giveaway, they’ll talk about it there. Also, be careful with websites that look strange or have odd web addresses. Your personal information is valuable. Don’t share your credit card details or personal info unless you’re absolutely sure it’s safe. And if you see a deepfake or scam, report it. This helps platforms like Facebook and TikTok fight these scams, but they need us to help find them. In summary, stay alert and skeptical. Don’t let things like the Le Creuset giveaway scam fool you. You can protect yourself from these clever but deceptive tricks by being cautious and informed!

,,Le Creuset fans beware: That's not really Taylor Swift in those Facebook ads,"Help keep Salon independent Over the last several weeks, a series of ads have appeared on Facebook featuring Taylor Swift’s voice encouraging “Swifties” to sign up to receive free Le Creuset cookware sets, all they had to do was click a link and provide some information about themselves.  While, as the New York Times reports, Swift is a fan of the brand — her collection has appeared in the background of the several Tumblr and Instagram accounts dedicated to her home decor — the advertisement was actually a scam. It was created using artificial intelligence technology that mimicked the singer’s voice, which was then laid over slips of Le Creuset Dutch ovens.  Swift is not the only celebrity whose AI-generated likeness has been used to sell products; as Salon reported in October, AI versions of Tom Hanks and the late Robin Williams have also been used without their consent.  Per the New York Times, “Le Creuset said it was not involved with the singer for any consumer giveaway” while representatives for Taylor Swift did not offer comment.

,,A Taylor Swift deepfake ad for Le Creuset went viral and loads of people fell for it,"If it’s too good to be true, it most def is Taylor Swift was not a part of a Le Creuset kitchenware giveaway, as some Swifties learnt the hard way getting caught up in an Artificial Intelligence-backed scam. An unconfirmed amount of fans were duped into believing that the 34-year-old was offering her dedicated fans the chance to snag some of the very Instagrammable cast iron cooking equipment via Facebook, according to The New York Times.  The video, featuring an autogenerated image of Taylor, complete with a near-perfect manipulation of her speaking voice, was shared via multiple Facebook pages and was even spotted on TikTok.  A scam ad on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok claims Taylor Swift is collaborating with Le Creuset, offering free cookware sets. This ad takes you to a fake website that aims to steal personal information and asks you to pay a ""delivery fee"". pic.twitter.com/DGxIK5gZ44 — Guardio (@GuardioSecurity) January 8, 2024 In the clip, a supposed recreation of her is heard saying: “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” “I got some exciting news to share! I have teamed up with Le Creuset for another epic gift-giveaway,” the caption of the fake Taylor scam reads. “But this time, we’re giving away FREE 20-piece cookware sets.” Victims were then directed to click a button underneath, leading them to a survey, with an extra urgent reminder that “supplies are running out” from Taylor, a noted fan of the brand. Their $625 Dutch oven made an appearance in her revealing Netflix documentary, Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince, and they are often seen dotted around her kitchen, according to Instagram posts.   After clicking, people arrived at a website that looked eerily similar to real sites like the Food Network, with professional-looking ads for Le Creuset. They even included fake but real-seeming customer reviews from fake but real-seeming customers. In order to claim their ‘prize’, a “small shipping fee of $9.96” had to be paid via a credit or a debit card. After handing over their card details and failing to receive their wares, that’s when the trouble revealed itself.  No source of the con has been confirmed, but one of the pages operates under the ‘The most profitable shares’.  Maybe Taylor will be the person to finally put the kibosh on the use of this tech https://t.co/Zd8tDKMlKg — I Am Bad Zina Ellis (@abitoverzellis) January 9, 2024 Dr Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University of Buffalo, told the newspaper that the technology used to recreate Taylor’s voice was “becoming very accessible these days,” hence why the problem was increasing. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we are seeing more, Dr Lyu continued, explaining that a “decent quality video” like this one could be made within 45 minutes.” The academic added: “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.”  People are far too dumb to coexist with AI.

,,Taylor Swift fans swindled by AI-generated Le Creuset ad scam,"NewsNation Damita Menezes   Subscribe Now (NewsNation) — Swifties, avid fans of pop sensation Taylor Swift, are falling victim to a sophisticated AI-generated scam that uses deepfake technology to dupe users into divulging sensitive information and parting with their hard-earned money. The scheme involves an AI-generated advertisement promoting a fake giveaway purportedly between Swift and Le Creuset, a popular cookware brand. The scammers strategically exploit the celebrity’s image and popularity to lend credibility to their fraudulent scheme. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the voice says in a robotic tone. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” In a statement, the cookware company said it had nothing to do with the fake ad, NBC news reported. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” Le Creuset said. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” NewsNation’s law and justice contributor, Jennifer Coffindaffer emphasized the convincing nature of the deepfake video, noting that even devoted fans found it challenging to distinguish between authentic content and the scam. “If it’s something that they’re endorsing, go ahead and do just a little bit of homework,” Coffindaffer advised. “Click on that product and go on to the web to see if her picture comes up. If you don’t see that picture of her, she’s not endorsing it because that’s the biggest thing they would want to show in their advertisement.” The difficulty in discerning deepfake content grows as the technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it nearly impossible for the naked eye to differentiate between genuine and manipulated videos. Coffindaffer acknowledged the challenges posed by scammers operating from foreign jurisdictions, making it challenging for law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to take effective action. “They will keep getting away with it if they’re truly in another country,” she explained. “It’s very difficult to bring anyone to justice.” The former FBI special agent highlighted the importance of tracing the financial trail to identify the culprits behind such scams. While the FBI has legal liaisons in many countries, the complexities of international jurisdiction present significant obstacles in prosecuting offenders. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

,,"Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez deepfakes used in Le Creuset giveaway scam","Deepfakes, technology to face-swap images, have ushered in a new era of scams. In the past year, fake video of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Mr. Beast have been used to shill products they don't actually endorse. The latest of these scams is a phony giveaway of cookware Le Creuset by deepfaked Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, the New York Times and others report. In these AI-generated videos that ran on Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok, Swift's appearance and voice were imitated to express that she's ""thrilled"" to give away free Le Creuset sets. There are also fake ads of Selena Gomez, according to cybersecurity site MalwareTips, where a deepfaked Gomez promises free cookware due to a warehouse error. These ads included links to websites appearing to be the Food Network and other legitimate news outlets, saying that the ""free"" Le Creuset items required a one-time ""small shipping fee of $9.96."" Users that attempted to claim the free set and entered their personal information didn't receive any Le Creuset, but instead were signed up to a monthly $89.95 subscription in addition to that ""shipping"" fee of $9.96, MalwareTips states. A Meta spokesperson told the Times that these fraudulent ads violate its policies, but are often missed by its review systems because creators cloak their content. Meta has taken legal action against some perpetrators of these scam ads. A TikTok spokesperson told the Times that creators are required to disclose whether media is synthetic or manipulated, and that advertisers must obtain consent for ""any synthetic media which contains a public figure."" AI fools us — and will continue to as the technology advances. Here's a rule of thumb: If an ad featuring a celebrity isn't on that celebrity's or the company's social media accounts, it's likely fake.

,,Taylor Swift fans scammed by fake AI-generated endorsement for Le Creuset cookware," The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Deepfake ad showed an AI-generated Swift saying she was ‘thrilled’ to be handing out free cookware sets  Related: Instagram launches Kendall Jenner AI chatbot Taylor Swift is not handing out free Le Creuset cookware sets, despite what one fake ad recently told the singer’s fans - aka “Swifties”. According to a report from The New York Times published on 9 January, Swifities were scammed by a fake endorsement generated by artificial intelligence using the Grammy winner’s voice and likeness. The fake endorsement, which reportedly appeared in ads on Facebook, showed an AI-generated Swift addressing her “Swifties” and saying she was “thrilled” to be handing out the free cookware sets. In several ads, footage of Swift was displayed alongside images of dutch ovens from the French-Belgian brand, which can cost anywhere from $180 to $750. The deepfake Swift urged viewers to click a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day. The ad then sent people to websites mimicking outlets such as the Food Network, highlighting news coverage of Le Creuset alongside testimonials from fake customers, the New York Times reported. Participants were asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware, but according to the outlet, those who gave their personal information never received the Le Creuset cookware and faced hidden monthly charges instead. Perhaps fans were fooled by the AI-generated ad due to Swift’s longtime affinity for the luxury cookware brand. Swift has been known to have the Round Dutch Oven, the Demi Tea Kettle, and the Cast Iron Skillet all stocked in her kitchen, according to a Facebook post from 2014. However, a representative for Le Creuset told the New York Times it has no partnership with the singer and urged customers to shop for their products on its official accounts or website. The Independent has contacted representatives for Swift for comment. This isn’t the first time that an AI-generated ad has used a celebrity’s likeness to peddle a certain product. Last October, Oscar winner Tom Hanks warned his fans not to be scammed by an AI-generated version of himself promoting a dental plan. In a clip posted to his Instagram, the Forrest Gump star told his fans that he had “nothing to do” with the ad created by AI. “BEWARE!! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it,” he captioned a photo of the AI version of himself. Meanwhile, actor Scarlett Johansson has previously taken legal action against an online app that allegedly used her name and likeness to promote their services without her permission. The AI image-generating app, called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar, reportedly used Johansson’s likeness to read out a 22-second advertisement. “What’s up guys? It’s Scarlett and I want you to come with me,” Johansson reportedly says in the ad, before her mouth is covered by a graphic and AI-generated photos of the actor appear on screen. “It’s not limited to avatars only. You can also create images with texts and even your AI videos. I think you shouldn’t miss it,” the AI-version of Johansson’s voice said. Underneath the advertisement, a line reads: “Images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person.” The Marvel actor’s representative confirmed to Variety that Johansson is not a spokesperson for the app and did not permit them to use her image. “We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have,” Johansson’s lawyer, Kevin Yorn, told the publication.

,,Le Creuset Calls Le Bullshit on AI-Generated Taylor Swift Ads,"If you’ve seen Miss Americana a few hundred times like the editor of this website, you likely remember a scene in which Taylor Swift prepares dinner for her best friend, Abigail. In it, the pop star mills around her kitchen, clumsily pours wine, and serves up what appears to be a bolognese made in none other than a robin’s egg blue Le Creuset dutch oven. Now, some four years later, a slew of falsified advertisements are using the famed cookware to target Swifties on Facebook and other social media platforms, according to the New York Times. In a number of the recently-emerged ads, an AI-generated Swift voice announces she’s “thrilled” to give away free Le Creuset cookware sets. Those who encounter the ad are directed to click on a button and answer some questions then, whoever is behind said scam, gains access to the users’ data and money.   The Times reported that “dozens” of similar scams—which also appeared on TikTok—using Swift’s likeness were visible on Meta’s public Ad Library. Scores of them appeared on timelines this month, alone. So, how do said scammers do it? A text-to-speech service that translates a script into an A.I.-generated voice. This can then be dubbed over footage of people talking to a camera. Eerie, no? Even more so given that Swift is only one of many celebrities who’ve been mimicked in fake ads. Tom Hanks, Gayle King, Joanna Gaines, and Luke Combs are just a few who’ve found themselves at the center of AI-generated scams in the last year. In early 2023, Better Business Bureau issued a warning to consumers that fake advertisements made with AI-generated celebrity voices and likeness have become “more convincing than ever.” Those who fall prey are often saddled with hefty charges and without the product they ordered. As of now, a definitive number of people who fell victim to the Swift scam has not been reported. To the Times, Le Creuset clarified that they’ve never been involved in any giveaway with Swift. To state the obvious: duh. A brand famous for peddling basic cookware items for a couple of hundred bucks each doesn’t just give them away. Representatives for Swift, however, have yet to address this scam. If you ask me, she now has the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever and actually partner with Le Creuset to give away some free pots and pans.

The scam posts and videos claims ‘Le Creuset partners with Taylor Swift to giveaway 20 cookware sets‘     Please enable JavaScript    However, at the order page for the Le Creuset cookware, instead of the $2 shipping fee, you would be tricked into a subscription scam. The Terms & Conditions written in small prints says ”You’ll be charged a one time charge of $119 at checkout ” Instead of a free Le Creuset Cookware, victims of this scam would get charged $119 for a shady subscription plan, and wouldn’t receive any Cookware. SCAM GIVEAWAY! Table of Contents The scam uses a deep fake generated video of Taylor Swift. A close look at the video shows the audio and facial expression don’t match.

So far, we’ve been able to uncover a handful of them – The first step you should take is finding out if the giveaway has been posted on the company’s social media accounts.

,,Is Taylor Swift Le Creuset Scam?,"The Maker Depot A fake online campaign that claims superstar pop singer Taylor Swift has collaborated with Le Creuset for an epic Christmas giveaway has made its way into social media via manipulated ads and suspicious external websites. But, the alleged cookware freebie is designed to steal customers’ data and money instead of a legitimate charity for celebrity products. This article exposes the fraud strategies that these scams use to profit financially even prudent people and offer information to avoid potential damage. The scam typically uses fake “deepfake” style video content which falsely portrays Swift signing the giveaway with images showing her baking treats for the holidays inside Le Creuset Le Creuset-branded Dutch ovens. Furthermore, the elaborate portal pages replicate reputable brand logos for news along with the urgency signals that encourage desired actions that are not based on reason. The tiniest terms and conditions disclosures are also used to conceal monthly subscription fees that exceed $100 instead of providing one-time costs for shipment of products estimated at around $10. The fake giveaway of Taylor Swift Le Creuset employs highly coordinated strategies to entice victims with the deceitful method: In conjunction with manipulative post on social networks, the infamous appliance scam is also facilitated by an array of fraudulent sites that offer phishing to lend false credibility to requests for sensitive details and payment information later. Let’s examine a variety of frequent suspicious web patterns that expose the scam’s underlying cause despite professional and convincing first impressions. False websites deliberately display logos of established media companies like Fox News, ABC and CNN without permission, in order to trick visitors into believing that there is a that previous reviews by journalists have confirmed the sweepstakes’ authenticity already. The increasingly popular celebrity-fronted product giveaway scam begins to circulate online advertisements that are seen on popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. They are based on fake AI video content displaying Taylor Swift enthusiastically explaining an exclusive deal that grants the free Le Creuset cooking sets fans who are able to enter at the correct the time frame: “Hey guys, Taylor Swift here with some exciting news!” declares the simulated promo video. “To celebrate the holidays and thank my amazing fans this year, I’ve teamed up with Le Creuset to give away some of their gorgeous Dutch ovens totally FREE!” The fake Swifty representation states that users simply click on the included links and then pay a small shipping fee of approximately $10 to secure contest rights to the expensive kitchenware. But, they are directed away from social media sites to a myriad of phishing sites totally unrelated to Le Creuset or the real Taylor Swift and her management. Decoy portal pages like “foxlifestyleoffers.com” showcase the Le Creuset logo alongside fake news articles depicting the giveaway already covered widely by established outlets like Fox and People Magazine. The goal is to dispel initial doubts to justify requests later asking for the sensitive payment of customers and personal information rather than raising suspicions. The website headers proclaim: “Taylor Swift Partners With Le Creuset for Massive Nationwide Cookware Giveaway – Claim Yours Now!” After sifting through fake news stories about the shortage of inventory and testimonials from customers, users arrive at custom orders that promise delivery of the cookware sets free of charge dependent on tiny $9.96 upfront handling and shipping fees. The hidden subscription clauses allow recurring monthly payments from partners, rather than one-time payments under $10. At the end of the day, consumers don’t get the premium cooking items that they were promised. However, compromised information allows scammers to continue to cause financial harm through unscrupulous sales of data underground due to unlocked credit cards or account access given to for chasing offers that seem too appealing to ignore. Another way to create the appearance of credibility from third parties involves creating a vivid collection of celebrity quotes to praise the huge festive cookware giveaway’s the urgency. However, further examination reveals there are no proofs linking the statements to actual press announcements. With prominent images prompting immediate participation, they are not able to review the rules, the buried phrases in the terms and conditions expose people signing up for expensive monthly subscriptions of $100+ instead of reasonable one-time shipping costs that secure “free” devices as depicted frequently in the above ads. This is clearly an indication of intent to entice the financial market in deceitful ways versus revealing. While amazing holiday sweepstakes that are closely tied to the status of celebrities can entice engagement on a superficial level By focusing on the details, you can protect individuals from foreseeable privacy and financial losses constantly. Take care to weigh emotional hooks against factual facts. In addition to other fraudulent websites, the alleged Taylor Swift free Le Creuset giveaway is also heavily distributed through the most popular social media platforms such as Facebook Instagram, Facebook and TikTok by manipulating video content as well as other deceit techniques that target users. Facebook Tactics Exploiting the Taylor Swift Le Creuset Scams Be cautious when posting on Facebook that show these problems Video ads using fake celeb media promoting free cookware deals Links in posts that are not paid for and descriptions redirecting to domains that are not on Facebook to unapproved domains Profiles spreading hype demonstrate very limited previous activities Hard-sell language demands that readers to act prior to fictional deadlines Comment sections focus on excitement about the contest instead of logically questioning anomalies For instance, fake spots that claim Taylor Swift gifted free Le Creuset sets should be scrutinized prior to engagement. Suspicious Instagram Approaches Promoting the Cookware Scam Taylor Swift tagged in unrelated other accounts she didn’t design herself Captions call for immediate action through potentially risky external links to “claim” prizes Profiles only discuss the details of the contest, with no expectation of personal sharing Unsuspicious visual filtering can degrade credibility The list of locations includes countries that are not related to the well-known U.S. corporate operations Particularly the case of any Instagram video that appears to show Taylor Swift gifted Le Creuset sets is worth a careful examination before moving on. Dangerous TikTok Videos Promoting the Taylor Swift Scam Sophisticated deepfakes depicting Taylor Swift endorsing improbable massive Le Creuset contests Links in captions redirect click traffic away from platform protections All positive comments are focused on the need for immediate participation Intense calls to action encourage rapid reaction which is in direct contradiction to the sensible checking If you see an unusually convincing video that is diverting away from an online platform that seems to be too good for to be true, trust your instincts and independently confirm its authenticity. In all social media channels the alleged celebrity-associated opportunities that sacrifice only a small amount of personal gains warrant careful examination prior to participating, to protect oneself from potential harm. It is common for something to appear too good is until it is proven otherwise. Keep a healthy sense of skepticism. If you’re now confronted with unauthorised or recurring charges after trying to win giveaways with questionable conditions, act: Inform relevant banks and credit institutions to be aware of a fraud scheme involving appliances that uses celebrity endorsements to create fraudulent pretenses to allow unidentified charges on accounts that are not authorized by the proper authority. Discuss the possibility of launching fraud dispute and a temporary repayment during the investigation. Contact information for customer service from documents relating to subscriptions and scam services. Contact each service clearly and state that you have that you have cancelled your authorization and realizing that you were a result of deceit rather than the fair terms that were presented initially to secure free products that require only shipping. Confirmation of the record should remain unaffected, which is the norm for unsavory groups dealing in illegal transactions, demonstrating the lack of trustworthiness. Check statements regularly to ensure cancellation holds as follow up contact is often difficult to reach the majority of anonymous operators in foreign countries. Because sharing personal information or access to accounts can create weaknesses, you should immediately change passwords and activate strong multi-factor authentication across all logins. You should consider proactive monitoring of credit and bureau-wide fraud warnings that inform suspicious activity that requires immediate intervention. Completely report criminal organizations as well as scam portals and the damage incurred through false pretenses with the government and third-party protection agencies. Document the events. Include all websites with names and header images that show trademarks not registered and celebrities’ media that aid in deceiving. These filings are a way to investigate the patterns of repeat offender behavior, ultimately necessitating legal intervention to assist affected victims who believed in that they had been misled at first without hesitation. While initially convincing there are a number of distinct suspicious signs that can reveal if the giveaways of celebrity products are actually aimed at to encourage financial theft instead of sensible lead generation in marketing or charitable donations: There is no evidence in Swift’s publicist or verified accounts proves that Swift is the fact that Swift is announcing giveaways of appliances for free. The triggers of pressure such as counting downs that tick and inventory claims trigger emotional responses, which can block the critical process of screening. Profiles of users spreading massive hype have very few previous activities on platforms, which raises questions. Redirects from legitimate social media platforms remove users from protections for internal moderation. Monthly subscription fees that exceed $100 are in contradiction to reasonable one-time $10 delivery charges. When they are aware of these patterns early people can avoid risking security, privacy and financial information by more carefully examining the unbelievable celebrity gifts prior to participation. Be skeptical before engaging in areas that have emotional triggers. Find the answers below to the most frequently asked queries regarding alleged Taylor Swift sponsored Le Creuset Christmas giveaways currently running on social media as well as suspicious external websites. Despite the fact that advertisements feature an impressive video clip that seems to show Taylor Swift endorsing an extraordinary Le Creuset giveaway for fans however, the whole campaign is an elaborate scheme to try to steal people’s credit card numbers and personal details instead of offering expensive cookware for free to anyone. There is no reason to believe that an individual celebrity gifting complete strangers $400+ cookware sets for providing minor shipping logistics. It’s hardly logical. Although it is possible in the future album promotion, the rumored popular Le Creuset contests fronted by Ms. Swift are more likely to be fraudulent attempts by third-party scammers to misleadly claim that they advocate for private agendas that are subtly pushing for unintentional financial damage. Despite social media promotions that promise free premium Le Creuset sets to fans who attempt to place orders, many customers never get the devices. However, the buried forms show that you have signed to pay for costly monthly subscriptions of $100 or more instead of the reasonable one-time delivery fees. These were first stated. Anyone who discovers unauthorized charges after an attempt as to be real giveaways should immediately inform the bank and credit agencies who are disputing transactions in connection with fake discovery, and seek assistance. Shutdown compromised access to accounts risks and then disclose details of the companies behind these practices to the appropriate fraud reporting group informing the public about fraud schemes faster to stop vulnerable victims. Do not assume that there is a guarantee of honesty when you see internet-based freebies that are linked to amazing stories that require temporarily giving up sensitive information first, without any external verification.

,,Taylor Swift fan warning after pop megastar’s voice is deepfaked for bogus ads offering giveaway – signs to watch for,"A HIGH-END cookware line has said they are not affiliated with an AI-generated ad involving a Taylor Swift deep fake. Le Creuset, a popular cookware brand, said they are not responsible for the ad circulating the internet that is using Taylor Swift's likeness by deepfaking her voice. In the ad, Swift's voice is played over shots of Le Creuset cookware and talking headshots of the pop star. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” said the deepfake voice, reports NBC News. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” The scam ad was originally posted on Facebook by a page titled ""The most profitable shares."" The ad has garnered over 2,300 views. Le Creuset released a statement that said they were not involved with the fake ad. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” the statement read. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts."" The statement continued: ""Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Although AI deepfake technology has been around for quite some time, the ease with which people's likenesses may be replicated without their consent has raised fresh concerns. And this is not the first time a celebrity's image and likeness have been illegally used in an AI-generated ad. When an AI-generated image of Scarlett Johansson appeared in an online advertisement in November, her legal team demanded a cease and desist from Lisa AI software. The software aimed to create stylized avatars based on real images of individuals. In another instance, YouTube Star MrBeast's image and likeness were used as a deep fake to advertise an iPhone 15 giveaway. The U.S. Sun has reached out to Le Creuset for comment.

,,Fans of Taylor Swift Are Alerted to the Le Creuset Scam,"    Fans of Taylor Swift should exercise caution because there is a new scam that targets people who want to enter Swift’s giveaway and is making the rounds on the internet. Scammers employ a variety of strategies to obtain users’ money or personal information, and AI-powered celebrity deepfakes are becoming more and more common. The phoney internet advertisement purports that Swift and Le Creuset worked together to give away free cookware, but it really directs you to other websites where your personal information and money are stolen. “These kinds of celebrity giveaway schemes are extremely evil since they rely on the public’s faith in the celebrity persona that they are appropriating,” stated Joseph Jones, the president of Bosco Legal and Investigation Services, in an interview with Newsweek. “In this case, Taylor Swift fans jumped on the chance to get associated with the celebrity via this marketing deal.” MalwareTips reports that the fraud is especially common on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. If you quickly enter your information, it is likely to include a convincing AI video that appears to depict Swift explaining the arrangement with the free cookware sets. “Hey guys, Taylor Swift is here to share some fantastic news!” In the video, a facsimile of Swift is heard saying. “To celebrate the holidays and thank my amazing fans for their support, I’ve teamed up with Le Creuset to provide away one of their beautiful Dutch ovens free.” According to David Derigiotis, chief insurance officer of Embroker and author of Parental Advisory: When to Protect Your Family in the age of Vandalism & Data Breaches, “deep-fake technology has steadily been a growing concern over the past couple of years,” Newsweek was informed.  These programmes’ accessibility combined with upgrades to the audio and visual quality make them the perfect weapon for thieves. When it comes to scams, trust is key, and deceitfully utilising the image of well-known celebrities or influencers might be the ideal tool for obtaining private information and money from gullible customers. The fact that clicking on the link can go to a page called “foxlifestyleoffers.com” that displays phoney news stories about the giveaway that appear to be from People and Fox makes it an extremely convincing hoax. Because they think it’s authentic, potential scam victims are therefore more likely to divulge their personal information. Experts say there are a few reasons why frauds such as this one are so devious and convincing. According to Jones, Taylor Swift fans were more concerned with participating in the contest than they were with being aware of the warning signs they typically see when shopping online. “The limited giveaway number, the sense of urgency, and the affordability were enough to entice people to fall for the scam.” The use of fictitious customer testimonials and the announcement that there were “only a few left” encouraged fans to give their credit card information without giving it much thought. There are even quotes from Taylor Swift that appear on websites, such as “I can’t wait to see fans opening their very own Le Creuset gourmet Dutch ovens on TikTok during the holidays after winning my biggest offer ever.” In the run-up to the Christmas, there was a deepfake Swift scam on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Many victims shared their bank information, not knowing what to do next. You should notify your banking institution and payment providers right away if you think you’ve been the victim of a scam and that the funds you received were fraudulent. The bank may occasionally refute a fraud accusation and repay you. It may also be necessary for you to get in touch with the customer support numbers provided under the scam in order to cease the automatic monthly payments. In the event that the charges persist, you must make it apparent that you are withdrawing your payment authorization and keep a copy of any confirmation information. To keep track of any unusual activity on your account, you should also reset all of your passwords and even register for a credit monitoring or bureau fraud alert system. To make the con artists less likely to operate again, you can also report them to the authorities and outside protection organisations. Jones warned that if you don’t take these precautions, you can become a victim of identity theft or perhaps financial collapse. Before choosing to click on any link, internet users should be aware of the many scams available, like the Swift scam. One thing to do is to conduct unbiased third party research to confirm any celebrity claim or social media offer before clicking on anything.

,,Le Creuset Gifts from Taylor Swift? Not Too Fast!,"Think of Taylor Swift teaming up with Le Creuset, the fancy cookware brand. Sounds like a cool giveaway, right? But hold up, not every story has a happy ending. Let's break down this combo and see if it's a tasty treat or just another trick in disguise. Enter the world of social media, where scams and fake giveaways are like undercover agents, and Facebook is their favorite hiding spot. Imagine this: tricksters using famous names – like celebrities and big brands – to fool folks into falling for money traps or giving away personal info, like credit card details. Scammers are using Deepfake to create celebrity look-alike videos claiming to be giving away too good-to-be-true goodies. In the latest scenario, they feature a fake Taylor Swift partnering with Le Creuset for what seems like a generous giveaway campaign disguised as a PR stunt. It's a tale that points to the risks when technology and trickery team up, painting a picture of a digital world where promises may not be what they seem. In the video, shared on a Facebook Page dubbed, “The Most Profitable Shares”, a woman can be seen saying, “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here […] Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” If you are not too careful, you would assume it's actually Taylor Swift, but upon a closer look, the cracks begin to show. For starters, the video is posted on their official pages and secondly, the page was only created a few weeks back. There are no followers nor are there any admins. All this suggests this is a scam and the page is only used as a scam tool. In our earlier prediction on the most likely scams in 2024, we noted that Generative AI will be used to con people this year. The warnings we shared about its potential misuse are now a reality, underscoring the ongoing challenges the world faces in dealing with technology that scammers exploit. Sadly, this is just the tip of the iceberg, scammers will use any and every celebrity to con unsuspecting users. To avoid this, you can use the following tips; Double-check the authenticity of online profiles, especially those claiming to be from familiar faces or organizations. Look for subtle discrepancies that may indicate a deepfake. If a video or message seems too good to be true or presents an unusual scenario, exercise caution. Deepfakes often manipulate content to evoke strong reactions. Use multiple sources to verify information presented in videos or messages. Authentic content is likely to be consistent across different platforms. Keep yourself updated on the latest developments in deepfake technology. Awareness can empower you to recognize potential scams and protect yourself. Stick to reliable communication channels and avoid sharing personal information or engaging in financial transactions through unfamiliar platforms or links. This reduces the risk of falling victim to phishing or scams. In summary, the collaboration between Taylor Swift and Le Creuset, which seemed like a cool giveaway, has turned out to be a fake scheme. Scammers are using Deepfake technology to create fake videos, making it look like Taylor Swift is promoting a giveaway with Le Creuset. This highlights the risks of technology being misused for scams. To stay safe, people should be cautious of online profiles, question content that seems too good to be true, verify information from different sources, stay informed about scams, and use reliable communication channels. As scams become more sophisticated, it's crucial for individuals to be aware and take steps to protect themselves online. Have you fallen for a hoax, bought a fake product? Report the site and warn others! As the influence of the internet rises, so does the prevalence of online scams. There are fraudsters making all kinds of claims to trap victims online - from fake investment opportunities to online stores - and the internet allows them to operate from any part of the world with anonymity. The ability to spot online scams is an important skill to have as the virtual world is increasingly becoming a part of every facet of our lives. The below tips will help you identify the signs which can indicate that a website could be a scam. Common Sense: Too Good To Be True When looking for goods online, a great deal can be very enticing. A Gucci bag or a new iPhone for half the price? Who wouldn’t want to grab such a deal? Scammers know this too and try to take advantage of the fact. If an online deal looks too good to be true, think twice and double-check things. The easiest way to do this is to simply check out the same product at competing websites (that you trust). If the difference in prices is huge, it might be better to double-check the rest of the website. Check Out the Social Media Links Social media is a core part of ecommerce businesses these days and consumers often expect online shops to have a social media presence. Scammers know this and often insert logos of social media sites on their websites. Scratching beneath the surface often reveals this fu So the worst has come to pass - you realise you parted with your money too fast, and the site you used was a scam - what now? Well first of all, don’t despair!! If you think you have been scammed, the first port of call when having an issue is to simply ask for a refund. This is the first and easiest step to determine whether you are dealing with a genuine company or scammers. Sadly, getting your money back from a scammer is not as simple as just asking.  If you are indeed dealing with scammers, the procedure (and chance) of getting your money back varies depending on the payment method you used. PayPal Debit card/Credit card Bank transfer Wire transfer Google Pay Bitcoin PayPal If you used PayPal, you have a strong chance of getting your money back if you were scammed. On their website, you can file a dispute within 180 calendar days of your purchase. Conditions to file a dispute: The simplest situation is that you ordered from an online store and it has not arrived. In this case this is what PayPal states: ""If your order never shows up and the seller can't provide proof of shipment or delivery, you'll get a full refund. It's that simple."" The scammer has sent you a completely different item. For example, you ordered a PlayStation 4, but instead received only a Playstation controller.  The condition of the item was misrepresented on the product page.

,,"No, Taylor Swift isn't giving away high-end cookware on Facebook"," Thanks to bad actors using A.I., you may have been convinced that Taylor Swift was personally endorsing a high-end line of cookware in a series of Facebook ads. As The New York Times reports, the ads, which have appeared on TikTok as well as Facebook, are for Le Creuset cookware, a brand that Taylor is known to use in real life. But they use both her face and her A.I.-created voice. In the ad, the fake Taylor voice was combined with footage of her and clips of Le Creuset Dutch ovens, and it ""said"" that she was ""thrilled"" to be giving away free sets of the pans as part of a promotion. It invited fans to click a button and answer a few questions. The ads sent viewers to websites masquerading as legitimate online locations, like the Food Network's site. Fans were asked to pay a small shipping fee of $9.96 to receive the ""free"" cookware. Those who agreed ended up being charged monthly hidden fees and never received the cookware, The Times reports. Le Creuset confirmed it was not part of this giveaway and noted it's not working with Taylor. According to the The Times, the fake campaign also used A.I. versions of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey in similar Le Creuset ads. Nine states have laws that regulate A.I. content, but as of yet, there's no federal law in place to outlaw this kind of scam. Two bills introduced in Congress last year hope to address these issues.

,,Taylor Swift Deepfaked in an AI Cookware Ad,"An AI-generated ad using Taylor Swift’s likeness has surfaced, fooling her fans with the celebrity’s voice used to promote Le Creuset’s high-end cookware. In the ad, the fake Taylor Swift is giving away free cookware to her fans on social media, as the trend continues with bad actors using celebrity AI voices to dupe unsuspecting fans of their money and personal information. The ad has already been taken down from Facebook, according to Fox News. In the ad, Tyler tells fans that she is excited to give away free sets of the cookware on condition they click on a certain provided link, according to a New York Times report. The report further indicates that numerous fans were directed to what looked like a genuine website full of fake reviews. But users only need to pay a small fee of $9.96 for shipping, while they also give away their personal information. “Hey, you all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free,” the AI-generated Taylor said. According to Fox News, Le Creuset and Taylor Swift had no part in the ad. Although the “Red” singer has previously expressed her love for the brand, she has never endorsed it officially. In a statement to Fox, Le Creuset said their promotions are clearly advertised on their official social media accounts. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts,” wrote the company. “Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” A computer science professor, Siwei Lyu, told the Times that the Taylor Swift ad must have been derived from “a text-to-speech platform,” adding that it was becoming easier to access AI tools. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” said Lyu. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” Also read: Replica Studios To License AI Digital Replicas Of SAG-AFTRA Actors There have been concerns over what AI can do and how it can be abused to spread misinformation and promote fake causes. A lot of celebrities have had their likeness used in fake AI ads or AI-generated music or videos. Sometime last year, Tom Hanks had to set the record straight after a dental plan ad was circulating on the internet, generated by AI. Another celebrity, Scarlett Johansson, was also a victim of AI-generated content, and her legal team was working to take proper legal action. Several AI experts have spoken about the downside of generative AI and how it is prone to abuse by unscrupulous individuals. AI expert Marva Bailer stated that people who choose to use AI to create these kinds of ads are risking their reputation and consumer loyalty by using ads that do not have contractual rights. This also comes as AI technology is making it easier for anyone with access to the technology to generate content ranging from images, audio, and video. “With the age of AI and artificial intelligence, the barrier to entry to create and disseminate content is not limited to professionals,” said Bailer. “Free tools that create professional images and campaigns are launched in minutes, reaching global audiences of millions. The ‘meme’ culture of creating context for entertainment changes drastically when the content is used to represent brands and commerce without legal consent,” she added. Bailer also highlighted that the speed at which AI tools create content provides ample opportunities for “ads to slip through.” ABOUT US NEWS POLICIES  ",metanews.com,https://metanews.com/tyler-swift-latest-celeb-to-be-ai-deepfaked/,

,,Deepfake videos of Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez used in elaborate Le Creuset online scam,"      According to cybersecurity site MalwareTips, the Le Creuset hoax has in actuality been incredibly extensive and elaborate, operating across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, as well as other social platforms using deepfake videos and sponsored posts. As the site notes: “The ads feature realistic-looking videos of various celebrities announcing they have excess Le Creuset inventory so they’re giving it away for free to fans.” Other celebrities supposedly exploited in the hoax have been Jennifer Lopez and Martha Stewart. While the ads convinced users that all that was needed was a simple and small shipping fee of approximately $9 to receive the free kitchenware set, in reality, the scammers’ prime goal was to gain access to personal information so that they could then force customers into a monthly $89.95 subscription in addition to the shipping fee. Deepfake videos are not only commonplace these days, they’re also incredibly effective and convincing. Almost anyone can now take a celebrity’s likeness and turn it into a deepfake video or image that then pushes a particular media narrative into the public. In October 2023, a viral video of Bella Hadid gained traction on X. The clip, which showed the model publicly showing her support for Israel, received over 30 million views and seemingly showed Hadid state that she “stands with Israel against terror.” While it was soon established that the video was fake, its impact was instantaneous and reflective of the power these deepfakes hold.

The audience's trust in the celebrity's image has been manipulated, highlighting the escalating problem of deepfake scams. The deepfake videos in question are a remarkable demonstration of AI's potential for misuse. They convincingly imitate Swift's voice and appearance, falsely claiming that due to a packaging error, 3,000 Le Creuset sets are being given away for free. This scam exploits fans' trust in the celebrity, demonstrating the nefarious potential of deepfake technology. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) has raised an alarm about the surge of such deepfake scams. The organization urges consumers to exercise caution before making purchases based on social media posts, as the products advertised may be substandard or non-existent. The escalating sophistication of these scams underscores the urgency for regulatory measures and accountability from online platforms. It's not just Taylor Swift's fans who have been hoodwinked by deepfake scams. Celebrity figures including Tom Hanks and news host Gayle King have also been impersonated in similar fraudulent schemes. The perpetrators remain unidentified, and neither Le Creuset nor Swift's representatives have commented on the matter, leaving fans and consumers in a state of uncertainty and apprehension.

,,"Beware Taylor Swift, the AI edition: The singer is not giving away free Le Creuset cookware","     Los Angeles Times AI-generated fake advertisements are making the rounds on social media again, this time using the voice and likeness of Taylor Swift promising free Le Creuset cookware sets. As any proper Swiftie knows, the “Hoax” singer is a fan of Le Creuset. In the pop star’s 2020 documentary “Miss Americana,” she whipped up some pasta sauce in the brand’s blue dutch oven. And back in 2014, Swift surprised “superfan” Gena Gabrielle by attending her bridal shower with several gifts in tow, including two items from the luxury cookware line. Scammers used artificial intelligence technology to craft a synthetic version of the singer’s voice, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The audio was played over various images of Le Creuset products and clips of Swift, some lifted from her 2016 interview with Vogue, “73 Questions with Taylor Swift,” in which the Grammy winner gives the outlet a tour of her home while answering rapid-fire questions. In multiple social media ads, Swift’s voice is manipulated to sound as though she’s “thrilled” to be giving away to her “loyal fans” free cookware sets that are available due to a “packaging error.” Fans need only to offer up their personal information and pay a $9.96 shipping fee. A spokesperson for Le Creuset told The Times in a statement that the brand is not not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts,” the statement said. “Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” Representative for Swift did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have made it easier to create deepfakes and convincing celebrity audio clips. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo, told the New York Times. Lyu added it could take less than 45 minutes to make a “decent-quality video.” Lyu continued that the fake Le Creuset giveaway was likely created using a text-to-speech service, which can translate a script into an AI-generated voice, and then paired with a video using a lip-syncing software. Last June, “Yellowstone” star and country musician Lainey Wilson saw her voice and likeness used by scammers to peddle weight loss gummies. The “Heart Like a Truck” hitmaker shared a video on Instagram slamming the fake ads. “By now I’m sure a lot of y’all have seen some ads about me losing weight, being hospitalized, and then I started taking some weight loss gummies and blah blah blah, they saved my life well surprise — it ain’t true,” she said. “People will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it’s lies because ain’t nobody sent me any gummies ... I love y’all. I just don’t want y’all spending your money on something that ain’t real, do not fall for it.” And in September, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks appeared in deepfake dental advertisements. The “Asteroid City” star quickly shot them down via his Instagram, sharing a still from the scam video with the caption, “Beware! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it.” Last year, when a sharp uptick in fake celebrity ads began plaguing the internet, USA Today shared a guide for spotting AI-generated videos that explained red flags to look out for, including perfect symmetry, distortion, unusual proportions and unnatural textures. There are also AI-detection tools that can be accessed online, including AI or Not and Maybe’s AI Art Detector.

,,Taylor Swift Fans Were Scammed By AI-Generated Le Creuset Ads,"Advertisement  ""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."" While the real Taylor Swift would never steer us wrong, her evil twin (read: an AI-generated avatar created by con artists) absolutely would. According to The New York Times, unidentified scammers used artificial intelligence and Taylor Swift's likeness to endorse a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway to steal money and data. Though Taylor is, indeed, a fan of Le Creuset, she has no formal deal with the luxury cookware brand despite how it appeared in online videos. The outlet reports that the fake promotional videos featured an uncanny Swift lookalike that was created with AI technology to replicate her appearance and voice. ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here,"" the AI Swift said in the ad. ""Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free."" Users were encouraged to click a button on the ad and complete a short survey. They were redirected to legit-seeming websites like The Food Network with fake testimonials on the products, Page Six reports. Advertisement And while we don't know who exactly is behind the con, a Facebook account titled ""The most profitable shares"" posted the Swift scam to its page. Swift's reps have yet to comment on the scandal, however, Le Creuset has released a statement of its own: ""Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."" Just last month, the Better Business Bureau warned the public about these highly-convincing deepfake scams. ""Scammers use deepfake technology to trick people. They take real video clips and photos of a person and use them to create new videos and audio clips. Deepfake images and videos can be surprisingly realistic,"" the BBB warned in a statement. ""Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account. The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you'll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn't exist."" Tom Hanks and CBS Mornings host Gayle King have similarly been used in AI scams, per CBS. According to the outlet, King recently shared a statement to her Instagram account denying claims she is affiliated with the fake weight loss ads circulating the internet with her likeness and told followers not to ""be fooled by these AI videos.""

,,Swifties Bewitched by AI-Generated Taylor Swift in Cookware Scam,"English                                    In recent events, fans of Taylor Swift, popularly known as Swifties, found themselves ensnared in a deceptive Ponzi scheme. The scam involved a deepfake video featuring an AI-generated Taylor Swift, falsely promoting a Le Creuset cookware giveaway. The deepfake video, astoundingly realistic, displayed an AI model resembling Swift uttering,  “Hey, you all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”  This fake endorsement exploited Swift’s known penchant for endorsing her favorite brands, a trait that has been evident through her social media and documentary appearances. The cunning use of Swift’s likeness in the video misled many fans, leading them to believe in the authenticity of the giveaway. Le Creuset and Meta, Facebook’s parent company, responded quickly to this fraudulent activity. Le Creuset clarified through an official statement that neither the brand nor Taylor Swift was involved in the ad, emphasizing that legitimate promotions would only come from their official channels. Meta, on their part, confirmed the removal of the deceptive advertisement from their platform. This incident underscores the complex landscape emerging in the age of artificial intelligence. Marva Bailer, a noted AI expert, pointed out the risks and ethical concerns around using AI in creating content, especially when it infringes on the rights of individuals and brands. The ease of creating and distributing AI-generated content poses significant challenges, blurring the lines between entertainment and misleading commercial representations. The rapid creation and consumption of content, estimated at thousands of ads per day, coupled with our diminishing attention spans, pave the way for such fake ads to infiltrate consumer consciousness. The incident is a cautionary tale about consumers’ need to be vigilant and discerning, especially in an era where AI is increasingly used to personalize and target content. Read More More US senators are demanding answers from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Tuesday’s high-profile social media fiasco related to the approval of Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETF). Senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyoming) wrote to the inspector general of the SEC on Friday requesting an investigation into the hack on the regulator’s X account. “The SEC’s failure to follow cybersecurity best practices is inexcusable, particularly given the agency’s new requirements for cybersecurity disclosure. Additionally, a hack resulting in the publication of material information for investors could have significant impacts on the stability of the financial system and trust in public markets, including potential market manipulation.” Someone compromised the SEC’s X account on Tuesday and issued a false statement claiming the regulator had approved spot Bitcoin ETF applications, whipping the crypto world into a temporary frenzy. SEC Chair Gary Gensler took to the social media platform 15 minutes later to explain that his agency’s profile had been hacked, and the false statement was deleted later that day. The SEC legitimately approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the following afternoon. X’s update page confirmed the SEC hack on Tuesday evening but claimed it wasn’t due to any breach of the social media giant’s systems. Rather, an unidentified individual reportedly secured control of a phone number associated with the SEC’s account. X also noted that the regulator failed to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for its profile, despite the fact that Gensler publicly encouraged investors last year to secure their financial accounts with that very feature. Hi @GaryGensler this is a reminder to secure your financial accounts as well as protect against identity theft and fraud. Remember to:
?Use strong passphrases or passwords
?Set up multifactor authentication
?Keep account alerts turned on#CybersecurityAwarenessMonth pic.twitter.com/KBNOV3KhAJ — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 10, 2024  Wyden and Lummis specifically called out the SEC’s lack of MFA in their letter. “We urge you to investigate the agency’s practices related to the use of MFA, and in particular, phishing-resistant MFA, to identify any remaining security gaps that must be addressed.” They aren’t the first senators to call out the SEC on its snafu. On Tuesday, J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) sent a public letter to Gensler demanding an explanation for the hack, which they noted led to Bitcoin price volatility and public confusion.

,,Swifties Fall For a Ponzi Scheme Featuring DeepFake Taylor Swift Promoting a Le Creuset Giveaway,"  Through social media postings, videos, and outfits, Taylor Swift is well-known for deliberately promoting her favorite businesses. The Le Creuset cookware fetish of Lavender Haze hitmaker has been featured on a Tumblr site devoted to her collection of home décor items on several occasions. The kitchenware is also included in the Netflix documentary Miss Americana, which was featured on Le Creuset's Facebook page, and in the gifts she choose to give at a fan's bridal shower. Meanwhile, as per Fox News, a deepfake video advertisement tricked Swifties into falling for a ponzi gimmick. The widely shared Le Creuset cookware commercial combined Swift's appearance and a phony rendition of her voice alongside pictures of the brand's cookware to advertise a prize.    McAfee Advisory!

Noted AI expert Marva Bailer explained that the fake ad ""may be generated using AI, but a human chose to risk their reputation, consumer loyalty or their job by allowing ads that do not have contractual rights for endorsement. The idea that the picture is ‘entertainment,’ or this is for ‘fun’ does not equate to the world of business and brands. Marketing agencies and professionals for the most part are aware of these requirements.""      ""With the age of AI, artificial intelligence, the barrier to entry to create and disseminate content is not limited to professionals. Free tools that create professional images and campaigns are launched in minutes reaching global audiences of millions.  The ‘meme’ culture of creating a context for entertainment changes drastically when the content is used to represent brands and commerce without legal consent,"" Bailer further stated.       She concluded, ""The speed at which content is created and consumed is estimated at 4,000-10,000 ads per day. With our attention span of 8 seconds, less than that of a goldfish, it presents opportunities for fake ads to slip through. AI is leveraged to understand preferences and increase personalization. [There is] potential to create fake reviews to show interest, create visuals that show use of the product that are imaginary. The promise of happiness, and beauty tied to a great deal and the quick press of the button may leave consumers disappointed."" Swift's team remained unavailable for comments.

,,That Taylor Swift AI-generated Le Creuset ad is not real,"        Le Creuset said it’s not affiliated with the artificial intelligence-generated Taylor Swift ad that has popped up online appearing to promote a cookware set. The ad, which began circulating on social media earlier this month, used Swift’s likeness by deepfaking her voice and layering it over camera shots of Le Creuset cookware spliced with clips of her speaking. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the voice says in a robotic tone. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” It appears to have originally been posted by a Facebook page titled “The most profitable shares,"" and as of Wednesday morning it had amassed about 2,300 views. A spokesperson for Meta told NBC News that the ad has been removed. A spokesperson for Swift did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the cookware company said it has nothing to do with the fake ad. “Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway,” Le Creuset said. “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads.” The ad is the latest in a string of AI-generated posts attempting to fake a celebrity's or influencer's endorsement of a product. In November, Scarlett Johansson’s legal team demanded the app Lisa AI, which generates stylized avatars based on real photos of people, to stop using an AI-generated version of her in an online ad. YouTube star MrBeast has also called out a viral deepfake video using his face and voice to advertise an purported iPhone 15 giveaway — just days after Tom Hanks posted his own statement on Instagram to clarify that he had “nothing to do with” a video using his AI-generated likeness to promote a dental plan. Although deepfake technology has been around for years, rapid advancements in generative AI over the past year — along with its growing mainstream use — have sparked renewed concern over the ease of replicating people’s likenesses without consent. In August, NBC News viewed more than 50 videos posted to platforms like Facebook, TikTok and YouTube that used digitally manipulated images and audio of public figures. All of those videos seemingly aimed to scam viewers of their money. The increasing accessibility of this technology has even led experts to speculate on the possibility of a “deepfake election” cycle this year, with political disinformation through AI-manipulated videos likely to run rampant. Others also worry about a growing market for deepfake porn, which thrives off producing fake videos featuring the likenesses of real people without their consent. Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.

,,Scammers created a deepfake of Taylor Swift giving away 'free' luxury crockery sets,"Adverts on behalf of Taylor Swift have appeared on social media offering free sets of expensive Le Creuset cookware. The adverts featured Taylor Swift's synthetic voice, generated by artificial intelligence. It addressed fans on her behalf with an invitation to receive sets of Le Creuset pots and pans. To do so, all they had to do was pay the shipping fee of just $9.96. However, after paying for shipping, the victims of the scam did not receive any cookware. Instead, regular payments were deducted from their cards. Le Creuset representatives confirmed that there was no free product giveaway. This is not the first case of using celebrity deepfakes in fraudulent schemes. But so far there is virtually no legislation in this area.

,,"Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez deepfakes used in Le Creuset giveaway scam","Deepfakes, technology to face-swap images, have ushered in a new era of scams. In the past year, fake video of celebrities like Tom Hanks and Mr. Beast have been used to shill products they don't actually endorse. The latest of these scams is a phony giveaway of cookware Le Creuset by deepfaked Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, the New York Times and others report. In these AI-generated videos that ran on Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) and TikTok, Swift's appearance and voice were imitated to express that she's ""thrilled"" to give away free Le Creuset sets. There are also fake ads of Selena Gomez, according to cybersecurity site MalwareTips, where a deepfaked Gomez promises free cookware due to a warehouse error. These ads included links to websites appearing to be the Food Network and other legitimate news outlets, saying that the ""free"" Le Creuset items required a one-time ""small shipping fee of $9.96."" Users that attempted to claim the free set and entered their personal information didn't receive any Le Creuset, but instead were signed up to a monthly $89.95 subscription in addition to that ""shipping"" fee of $9.96, MalwareTips states. A Meta spokesperson told the Times that these fraudulent ads violate its policies, but are often missed by its review systems because creators cloak their content. Meta has taken legal action against some perpetrators of these scam ads. A TikTok spokesperson told the Times that creators are required to disclose whether media is synthetic or manipulated, and that advertisers must obtain consent for ""any synthetic media which contains a public figure."" AI fools us — and will continue to as the technology advances. Here's a rule of thumb: If an ad featuring a celebrity isn't on that celebrity's or the company's social media accounts, it's likely fake.

,,IDAHO BEWARE: NEW TAYLOR SWIFT SCAM TARGETS YOUR PERSONAL INFO," The holidays might be over but scammers aren't done trying to rip us all off. This time, it's in the form of none other than Taylor Swift. If you're unfamiliar with artificial intelligence (A.I.), you might want to buckle up because things are going to get twisted. One of the biggest controversies that we're seeing right now with artificial intelligence is its use to replicate the art of others. For example, users are getting creative with its use and have gone as far as to have A.I. create songs by their favorite artists using that artist's voice without their permission. That's what scammers are doing with Taylor Swift's voice in a viral ""ad"" promoting a cookware giveaway. In the since-deleted video, Taylor is seen ""talking"" briefly before cutting to a series of videos of people opening Le Creuset cookware. ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here and due to a packaging error we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets so I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free,"" the ad begins in Taylor's voice. Seriously - imagine reading this by itself in an email and not in Taylor's voice, you would likely pick up on a scam. ""If you're seeing this ad you can get a free Le Creuset cookware set today,"" Artificial Taylor says before ""reminding"" Swifties, ""But just a heads up there are a few rules: you must live in the United States and you can only get one per kitchen set per household."" If you're at this point in the video and are a hardcore Swiftie, we could see hear why their guard would be down by this point. The voice does resemble Taylor, but if you pay close attention to the video, you'll see that the audio doesn't match her mouth very well. ""All you have to do is click the button below and answer a few questions. These will only be given out until the end of the day today so don't hesitate. Supplies are running out so get yours while you can. Thank you guys for all your support and I hope you love your new cookware set!"" While we couldn't find the link anywhere (nor we would want to access it) but according to several reports, the link takes you to what appears to be a legit Food Network site that asks you a series of personal questions. There's no telling how many people had their personal and bank account info compromised but it was enough for Le Creuset, the cookware brand, to issue a statement on the matter according to Delish.com: Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads. This is just another example of how A.I. and deepfake technology can be used in malicious ways and why we need to continue to do what we can to fact-check any promotions we see online. We searched through the web hoping to find the video to share with you and it seems like most of them have been taken down (understandably so).

,,Taylor Swift Fans Duped By AI-Generated Ads Using Pop Star’s Likeness In Fake Cookware Giveaway,"AI-generated videos of Taylor Swift’s likeness promoting a fraudulent Le Creuset cookware giveaway have tricked several fans into purchasing it. The deepfake videos feature what appears to be Swift doing a promotional pitch, per a CBS News report. The videos have been circulating on Facebook. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the Swift replica can be heard saying in the video. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” Viewers, whom the AI image addressed as “Swifties,” were then instructed by the faux Swift to click a button below the ad to complete a survey. The ad conveys a sense of urgency, saying that “supplies are running out.” People who clicked on the ad were sent to websites that appeared to be legitimate, like The Food Network. They were next shown fake news coverage of the product and testimonials by fake customers, per The New York Times. Scam victims were asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware. They didn’t realize that paying that fee would lead to a hidden recurring charge and would not result in getting the pricey cookware at all.   A Facebook account called “The most profitable shares” promoted the deepfake video, though CBS News noted that it’s unclear who is behind it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP Fans were likely duped in part because Swift is known for her love of Le Creuset. In 2020, the brand shared an image on Facebook from the Grammy Award winner’s Netflix documentary “Miss Americana.” The post showed her in the kitchen using the brand’s round Dutch oven. This is not the first deepfake ad scam featuring a celebrity to make the rounds on social media. In October, Tom Hanks warned fans that he was not promoting a dental plan and that any ads featuring his likeness were fake, as The Daily Wire previously reported.  “BEWARE!! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it,” Hanks shared on Instagram at the time.  CBS Mornings host Gayle King’s AI likeness was also associated with a scam. King denied any connection to the fake weight loss-related video from a company called Artipet.

,,University of Michigan School of Information,"Here’s a news flash: Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift are not giving away Le Creuset cookware at too-good-to-be-true prices. But according to Mashable, some trusting individuals have been tricked by deepfakes of celebrities into signing up for expensive, unwanted subscriptions. If you think you’re going to get that $200 casserole for $9.96 in shipping costs, remember that Taylor and Selena are not Ellen. Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas (aka CES) offers a showcase for new and aspiring products – some of which will actually come to market. And tech reporters are eager to catalog their top picks. Variety’s favorites include a transparent TV and a budget-friendly alternative to Apple’s upcoming Vision Pro, while The Verge is highly impressed with a Hyundai that can turn on its axis. Goodbye, parallel parking woes. So says a convicted iPhone thief, explaining to Wall Street Journal tech reporter Joanna Sharpe in a video interview how he stole passcodes and thousands of dollars from his victims. Her story led Apple to add new anti-theft protection rolling out this month, according to The Verge. TL; DR: Don’t hand your phone to strangers bearing drugs. Insomniacs might disagree, but a study by scientists at McGill found that the average human spends 9.1 hours asleep each day. What we do with the other 14.9 hours is illustrated in a pie chart published by Scientific American. We spend most of our waking time taking care of ourselves, they found, and very little time–about five minutes–taking care of the planet. Even a few more minutes a day could make a meaningful difference, they believe. Two massive public library systems were hit by hacker attacks in October. The Toronto Public Library is currently storing returned books in 12 tractor trailers off site as they wait to be checked back in, according to the CBC. Meanwhile, Euronews reports the British Library’s catalog came back online in January after an attack took down its entire website. In both cases, the hackers attempted to auction off patrons’ information on the dark web; both libraries are still considered crime scenes. Chicago high school principal Seth Lavin, writing for the LA Times, reflects on his experience swapping his smart phone for a flip-phone. Despite the scorn of students and family, he spends less time scrolling and more time connected to his world. Though he admits he does have to print out directions now. Tempting as it might be to discredit your employer after being laid off, experts agree it’s probably not the smartest career move. Yet a current trend among tech workers who have recently lost their jobs is to film themselves as they’re being fired online and then post the dismissal on social media. As the BBC asks, what could possibly go wrong? It’s no secret that robots can be made to look like humans–Disney did it decades ago. But if you want to see something a bit unnerving, watch the humanoid robot Ameca appear to amuse herself making faces in a mirror. This Laughing Squid article includes videos of Ameca reflecting on her best day and getting some bad news about the destruction of the planet, which doesn’t seem to scare her much. But then, she’s not a squishable human. The cold snap last month brought a rude awakening to some Tesla drivers who discovered that battery-powered vehicles don’t do well in frigid weather. The New York Times chronicled the woes of drivers facing long lines at charging stations or needing to be towed when their battery died.

,,Taylor Swift fans scammed by AI-generated Le Creuset endorsements,"  In the increasing list of AI-generated scams, fraudsters have now produced counterfeit advertisements featuring Taylor Swift for a high-end cookware brand Le Creuset.
The ads, created using Swift's deepfake video and AI-generated voice, tricked her fans into parting with their money and personal information.
These deceptive endorsements had been spread across social media platforms like Facebook and TikTok, imitating the pop star. The impersonations of celebrities using AI tools are on the rise. Recently, Hollywood icon Jimmy Stewart's voice was recreated by a voice-cloning startup Respeecher, using a voice actor.
Similarly, Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson have also been victims of voice-cloning in the past. Johansson also sued an app by the name of Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar for using her voice and face in its ad. In these bogus ads, the AI-created Swift excitedly offers to give away free Le Creuset cookware sets to her followers, known as Swifties.
It urged the users to click on a button and answer a few questions before the day ended.
Upon clicking the link, they got directed to seemingly authentic websites, such as the Food Network, showcasing fabricated customer reviews and false news stories about the product. Once the user(s) is on the link, they were scammed into paying a ""small shipping fee of $9.96"" for the cookware. Eventually, they end up paying a concealed monthly charge while never receiving the promised Le Creuset pot.
Dr. Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor, informed the New York Times that it takes under 45 minutes to generate a ""decent-quality"" video using AI tools, which are becoming increasingly available. Swift isn't the only celebrity targeted in such cons.
Country singer Lainey Wilson, interior designer Joanna Gaines, and lifestyle blogger Ree Drummond have also reportedly been implicated in similar scams.
Meanwhile, Le Creuset confirmed they were running no such deals, and had no association with Swift.
They further urged consumers to buy products from their official website, further cautioning them against clicking on dubious ads. ",www.newsbytesapp.com,https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/ai-used-to-scam-taylor-swift-fans/story,
,,Taylor Swift fans are being 'scammed' by deepfake Le Creuset ad starring singer," Taylor Swift fans have been warned not to fall for a deepfake AI ad circulating Facebook, with the 'singer' claiming to be offering 'free Le Creuset cookware' to her fans. In the ad, which is seemingly realistic to an unsuspecting user, 'Swift' offers fans free kitchen pots from the luxury cookware brand, if they sign up to pay a shipping fee. Those who have done so, of course, have never seen any product, just unusual monthly payments coming out of their accounts.

,,Is that Taylor Swift shilling for Le Creuset cookware? No. It’s an AI deepfake.," Please enable JavaScript        Taylor Swift likes to cook and Swifties know that she has a thing for Le Creuset cookware, documented in a Tumblr account, some gifts for a fan’s bridal shower, and shots of it in a Netflix special. Le Creuset included some of that on their Facebook page. So when her face and voice showed up in Facebook and TikTok ads that endorsed Le Creuset, most people didn’t give it much thought. I mean, given her affinity for Le Creuset, it seemed like a natural fit. Actually, those ads are deepfakes. They feature an AI version of both her face and voice mated together with various shots of her with the cookware taken from legitimate sources. What was suspicious, though, was that Fake Tay-Tay said she was “thrilled” to be giving away free cookware sets. All anyone had to do was click on a link and answer a few questions. The cookware could be yours for just $9.96 in shipping. Fake fake fake. People were phished. Not only were they dupe out of their $9.96, but they also found themselves subjected to hidden monthly charges. And the cookware? Never showed up. Fake Tay-Tay wasn’t the only AI bait. The campaign also used a fake Martha Stewart and a fake Oprah. (Oprah was also burned by a 2022 fake ad that had her endorsing weight loss gummies.) How was this done? Probably with any number of text-to-speech programs available for free online. This is a growing problem. Tom Hanks, Tom Waits, Gayle King, MrBeast, and others have all had their images, likenesses, and voices stolen to create these videos which bait people into clicking things they shouldn’t. There’s a nearly six-minute video of Taylor talking about government stimulus cheques. Be careful out there. Deepfakes are everywhere.

,,New Deepfake Video Scam has “Taylor Swift” Offering Free French Cookware,"A new wave of ads utilizing video of well-known celebrities seemingly promoting video games, fake giveaways, and more are starting to popup, and fans are falling for this trap. McAfee posted a tweet on X earlier this month about how their latest technology exposes deepfake audio and video scams for their true nature. They offer a copy of the video that shows what looks like Taylor Swift talking about giving away Le Creuset cookware sets. What makes the scam so convincing to the untrained and unprepared eye is that it starts with Taylor talking (although the video doesn’t match with the words she’s “saying”) and quickly shifts to video of a surplus of cookware. The use of deepfake audio is the key here. The combination of a convincing audio track and mixing in some video of “Taylor” speaking is apparently all that’s needed to trick would-be victims. The crux of a good scam is the “illusion of credibility” – often attained through person, domain, or brand impersonation. In the Taylor Swift scam, it’s the deepfake voice and a bit of video. Regardless of the techniques or technologies used, individuals seeing such content from any celebrity or well-known figure should quickly realize that Taylor Swift doesn’t want to give everyone a dutch oven. The old adage “if it looks too good to be true, it usually isn’t” stands true here. Scammers are going to continue to hone and improve their craft using deepfaked audio and really good video to trick their victims. We're already starting to see this trend this year.

,,SWIFTIES BEWITCHED BY AI-GENERATED TAYLOR SWIFT IN COOKWARE SCAM,"In recent events, fans of Taylor Swift, popularly known as Swifties, found themselves ensnared in a deceptive Ponzi scheme. The scam involved a deepfake video featuring an AI-generated Taylor Swift, falsely promoting a Le Creuset cookware giveaway. The deepfake video, astoundingly realistic, displayed an AI model resembling Swift uttering,  “Hey, you all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.”  This fake endorsement exploited Swift’s known penchant for endorsing her favorite brands, a trait that has been evident through her social media and documentary appearances. The cunning use of Swift’s likeness in the video misled many fans, leading them to believe in the authenticity of the giveaway. Le Creuset and Meta, Facebook’s parent company, responded quickly to this fraudulent activity. Le Creuset clarified through an official statement that neither the brand nor Taylor Swift was involved in the ad, emphasizing that legitimate promotions would only come from their official channels. Meta, on their part, confirmed the removal of the deceptive advertisement from their platform. This incident underscores the complex landscape emerging in the age of artificial intelligence. Marva Bailer, a noted AI expert, pointed out the risks and ethical concerns around using AI in creating content, especially when it infringes on the rights of individuals and brands. The ease of creating and distributing AI-generated content poses significant challenges, blurring the lines between entertainment and misleading commercial representations. The rapid creation and consumption of content, estimated at thousands of ads per day, coupled with our diminishing attention spans, pave the way for such fake ads to infiltrate consumer consciousness. The incident is a cautionary tale about consumers’ need to be vigilant and discerning, especially in an era where AI is increasingly used to personalize and target content. Disclaimer.

,,DON’T GET SCAMMED BY THE TAYLOR SWIFT LE CREUSET GIVEAWAY,"Zero Thought Subhan N December 25, 2023 A fake online campaign that claims the mega-star Taylor Swift has collaborated with Le Creuset for an epic Christmas giveaway has made its way into social media via manipulated ads as well as questionable websites. The supposed freebie for cookware is aimed at stealing the data and money of users instead of providing a reasonable charitable donations from celebrities. This article reveals the shrewd fraud strategies that these scams use to profit financially even the most prudent of people, and provide advice on avoiding possible damages. Examine these Instagram elements that are questionable that are connected to the free Le Creuset offers: Taylor Swift tagged in unrelated other accounts she didn’t design herself Captions encourage immediate action via dangerous external links that “claim” prizes Profiles only discuss contest details, without any expectation of personal sharing The presence of suspicious visual filters can distort the credibility The list of locations includes countries that are not related to any known U.S. corporate operations Particularly the case of any Instagram video purporting to be Taylor Swift gifted Le Creuset sets is worth a careful examination before moving on. Dangerous TikTok Videos Promoting the Taylor Swift Scam The increasingly frequent celebrity-fronted giveaway scam is beginning to circulate on the internet. advertisements that are seen on popular platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. They feature fake AI video content that shows Taylor Swift enthusiastically explaining an exclusive deal that grants the free Le Creuset kitchenware to fans who are able to enter at the correct the time frame: “Hey guys, Taylor Swift here with some exciting news!” is the opening line of the promo video. “To celebrate the holidays and thank my amazing fans this year, I’ve teamed up with Le Creuset to give away some of their gorgeous Dutch ovens totally FREE!” The fake Swifty depiction claims that the viewers just need to follow the links provided and pay small shipping vouchers approximately $10 to secure contest rights to the expensive kitchenware. But, they are redirection from social media to a variety of elaborate phishing websites totally unrelated to Le Creuset or the real Taylor Swift and her management. Decoy portal pages like “foxlifestyleoffers.com” showcase the Le Creuset logo alongside fake news articles depicting the giveaway already covered widely by established outlets like Fox and People Magazine. This is aimed at removing initial suspicion to justify requests later asking for the sensitive payment of customers and personal data, rather than triggering suspicions. The headers of the website proclaim: “Taylor Swift Partners With Le Creuset for Massive Nationwide Cookware Giveaway – Claim Yours Now!” After navigating through fake news stories about the shortage of inventory and customer reviews, customers end up with customized order forms that promise to deliver the cookware sets for free dependent on tiny $9.96 upfront shipping/handling charges. The hidden subscription clauses permit recurring monthly fees from partners, rather than one-time payments under $10. The consumers don’t get the premium cooking items that they were promised. The compromised data allows fraudsters to to cause financial harm through unscrupulous underworld data sales channels due to the unlocked credit card or account access given to chase deals that appear too tempting to not take advantage of. Inform relevant banks and credit institutions to be aware of a fraud scheme involving appliances with celebrity endorsements, under fraudulent pretenses to allow unidentified charges to accounts without consent. Request information on launching fraud cases and a temporary repayment during the investigation. Get customer contact details from documents that are linked to fraudulent subscriptions and services. Contact each service clearly and state that you have that you have cancelled your authorization and realizing that you profited from deceit, rather than the fair terms that were presented initially to secure free products which require just shipping. The confirmation of your record is required if remain unaffected, which is typical for unethical organizations dealing with lack of trustworthiness. Check statements regularly to ensure cancellation is not a problem since follow-up contacts are often inaccessible to mostly anonymous companies located overseas. Because sharing personal information or access to accounts can create weaknesses, you should immediately change passwords and implement strong multi-factor authentication across all logins. You should consider proactive monitoring of credit as well as bureau alerts to inform suspicious activities that require immediate intervention. Completely report offenders as well as scam portals and the losses incurred in false pretenses to government agencies and third-party protection agencies. Document the events. Give all website names that are available as well as header images showing trademarks not registered and celebrities’ media that aid in deceiving. These reports support the investigation of general repeat offenders patterns, eventually necessitating legal intervention to assist those who have been negatively affected by that they had been misled at first without hesitation. Red Flags Exposing Deceptive Taylor Swift Giveaway Scam Sites Alongside manipulative postings on social media, this celeb appliance scam also makes use of the network of sites that offer phishing to lend false credence to the demand for sensitive details and payment information later. Let’s examine a variety of regular suspicious patterns on websites that reveal the underlying fraud despite the convincing first impressions of professionalism. False websites deliberately display logos of established media brands such as Fox News, ABC and CNN without permission, in order to fool visitors into thinking that they have read a that previous reviews by journalists have confirmed the sweepstakes’ legitimacy already. Another method of creating the appearance of credibility from third parties involves creating a vivid collection of celebrity quotes that praise the huge Christmas cookware contest’s and its urgency. However, a deeper examination uncovers no evidence linking the quotes to actual press announcements. Although prominent images call for immediate participation, they are not able to review the rules, hidden clauses and conditions reveal people signing up for expensive subscriptions that cost more than $100 per month instead of reasonable one-time shipping charges that guarantee “free” devices as depicted often in the ads above. This clearly shows intent in eliciting the financial market in deceitful ways versus revealing. While amazing holiday sweepstakes that are closely tied to the status of celebrities can entice engagement on a superficial level By focusing on the details, you can protect people from privacy-related and financial losses constantly. Be sure to evaluate emotional triggers in relation to factual facts. In addition to fraudulent external websites, the alleged Taylor Swift free Le Creuset giveaway is also heavily distributed through the major social media platforms like Facebook Instagram, Facebook and TikTok with manipulated video content as well as other deceit techniques that target users. Let’s examine the suspicious signs that generally reveal the questionable cooking equipment on each platform. Facebook Tactics Exploiting the Taylor Swift Le Creuset Scams Be cautious when posting on Facebook that show these problems Videos that advertise using fake celebrities who endorse cooking equipment that is free Links in unpaid posts as well as descriptions that redirect to domains that are not on Facebook to unapproved domains Profiles spreading hype demonstrate very limited previous activities Hard-sell language demands that readers take action before deadlines fictional Comment sections focus on excitement about the contest instead of logically questioning anomalies For instance, fake spots that claim Taylor Swift gifted free Le Creuset sets should be scrutinized prior to engagement. Sophisticated deepfakes depicting Taylor Swift endorsing improbable massive Le Creuset contests The captions in the captions direct click traffic to platforms that do not have protections All positive comments are focused on the need for immediate participation The force of the call to action incentivizes rapid response which is in direct contradiction to the an advisable checking If you come across an oddly convincing video that is diverting away from the platform, which seems like being true, follow your gut and independently confirm its authenticity. All social platforms the alleged celebrity-associated opportunities that sacrifice very little in exchange for a substantial gains warrant careful examination prior to taking part, ensuring that one is protected from potential harm. The best thing that can happen isn’t until it’s proven otherwise. Keep a healthy sense of skepticism. While initially convincing however, a series of consistent warning signs can reveal if the giveaways of celebrity products are actually aimed at to encourage financial theft instead of legitimate lead generation for marketing or charitable donations: The absence of evidence from Swift’s publicist or verified accounts proves that Swift is the fact that Swift is announcing giveaways of appliances for free. Stress triggers such as countdowns with ticks or inventory claims trigger emotions, thereby avoiding the critical process of screening. Profiles of users spreading massive hype have very few prior platform activity, causing legitimacy questions. Redirects from legitimate social media platforms remove users from the internal moderation safeguards. Monthly subscription fees that exceed $100 do not match reasonable one-time delivery charges. If they recognize these patterns in the early stages people can avoid risking the privacy of their data, finances and personal information and can better evaluate shocking celebrity gifts prior to participation. Be skeptical before engaging in areas that have emotional triggers. Find the answers below to the most frequently asked queries regarding alleged Taylor Swift sponsored Le Creuset holiday giveaways that are currently being circulated on social media as well as suspicious external websites. Despite the fact that advertisements feature impressive video footage that appears to show Taylor Swift endorsing an extraordinary Le Creuset giveaway for fans The entire campaign is an elaborate scheme to try to steal people’s credit card numbers and personal details instead of offering expensive cookware to anyone. There is no evidence that suggests the legitimacy behind the claims of promotions. The scam typically uses manipulative “deepfake” style video content which falsely portrays Swift supporting the giveaway along with images showing her baking treats for the holidays inside Le Creuset Le Creuset-branded Dutch ovens. Furthermore, the elaborate portals mimic news logos and warnings of urgency that call for actions beyond reasoned thinking. The tiniest terms and conditions disclosures additionally conceal monthly subscription costs that exceed $100 instead of paying for one-time shipment costs that are estimated to be around $10. There is no reason to believe that an individual celebrity gifting complete strangers sets of cookware worth $400+ providing minor shipping logistics. It’s hardly logical. Although it is possible in the future album promotion, the rumored online Le Creuset contests fronted by Ms. Swift are more likely to be frauds by third parties trying to deceive the public into believing that they are advocating for private agendas that are subtly pushing for irreparable financial harm.

Follow these steps to mitigate the impact of the scam and protect your assets: Symptoms: The unwanted application can cause several adverse effects, such as displaying intrusive pop-up ads and slowing down internet browsing. The threat can manipulate the settings of an internet browser. This manipulation forces users to visit the hijacker’s website and conduct internet searches using their search engine. Distribution: Browser hijackers or adware such as Taylor Swift Le Creuset Giveaway Scam can spread through deceptive pop-up ads, free software installers that are bundled with malware, and fake Flash Player installers. Removal: To remove the threat, scan your system with powerful SpyHunter anti-malware software  The purpose of adware or browser hijacker is to generate revenue through targeted advertising. It collects user data, such as browsing habits and preferences, to deliver personalized ads. By bombarding users with ads, the unwanted program aims to increase the chances of users clicking on them, leading to potential revenue for its developers. While adware is primarily an annoyance and can compromise user privacy, it is often a means for companies to monetize free software and services without directly charging users. The primary objective of a browser hijacker is to promote certain websites, generate traffic, and potentially earn revenue through advertising or other means by exploiting the user’s browsing experience without their consent.  Devices can fall victim to browser hijackers or adware through the download of infected files, malevolent email attachments, or visits to compromised websites. These hijacking tools may be bundled within browser extensions or included as part of software packages. Additionally, browser based threats can stem from shareware, freeware, or spyware infections, further expanding their potential sources of origin. Potentially unwanted programs like Taylor Swift Le Creuset Giveaway Scam often find their way onto users’ devices unintentionally, as users can be deceived into unknowingly downloading them. This can occur when users agree to an extra download mentioned in the terms and conditions of software installation. Another tactic involves misleading users with a choice to decline the installation of the browser hijacker software, but the wording deliberately confuses them, resulting in the inadvertent download. Once installed, PUP initiates its malicious actions by manipulating the user’s browser activities through embedded malevolent code.  Browser hijacking refers to the unauthorized modification of web browser’s settings or behavior by malicious software or websites.  It can have various impacts on users and their browsing experience. Here are some common impacts of browser hijacking:  This undesirable application can cause instability in web browsers by modifying critical settings, introducing incompatible software, or consuming system resources. Users may experience frequent crashes, slow performance, or unresponsiveness while browsing. In more severe cases, browsing hijacking can lead to unauthorized access to online accounts. PUPs may attempt to steal login credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data, putting users at risk of identity theft or fraud. Furthermore, browser hijacking can be a part of a larger malware infection. In such cases, adware or hijacker may serve as a gateway for other malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or spyware, further compromising the user’s system and data. Also, browser-based threats with data collection abilities can cause severe problems. They can gather sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal details, leading to identity theft and fraud. The collected data may also be sold to third parties, compromising user privacy. Additionally, targeted advertising based on the collected information can result in a flood of intrusive and potentially malicious ads.

,,Taylor Swift Deepfake: Le Creuset Cookware,"Introducing the Deepfake Detection Dashboard                                     A recent online scam involving a Taylor Swift deepfake has highlighted the potential dangers of advanced AI. Deepfakes, which use AI to digitally impersonate people’s appearance or voice, are becoming increasingly commonplace. This incident involved the use of a deepfake posing as music superstar Taylor Swift to dupe fans into purchasing non-existent cookware. Summary of the Taylor Swift Deepfake Incident A series of fraudulent ads featuring a deepfake of Swift recently circulated on social media, particularly Facebook. The ads used convincing AI-generated video and audio of Swift promoting Le Creuset cookware and offering free sets to fans. The deepfake Swift claimed that fans could receive free Le Creuset pots and pans by answering a few questions and paying a small $9.96 shipping fee. However, those who provided payment information never received any cookware. The ads were realistic enough to fool some devoted Swift fans. The deepfake accurately cloned Swift’s voice and appearance by manipulating video footage that seems to have originated from her 73 Questions interview with Vogue. Le Creuset has denied any partnership with Swift or involvement with the ads. Swift and her team have not publicly commented on the incident.  Resemble Detect results for the Taylor Swift Video Dangers Highlighted by the Scam This fraudulent use of deepfake technology raises concerns. As deepfakes become more sophisticated, it gets harder to detect bogus videos and audio. This places individuals’ reputations and privacy at risk. It also erodes public trust in media authenticity. Other celebrities have fallen victim to similar deepfake scams, including Scarlett Johansson and Tom Hanks. As the technology spreads, more high-profile deepfake scams are likely.  A still from the fraudulent Taylor Swift deepfake video used in an online scam to falsely promote Le Creuset cookware giveaways. The doctored video featured convincing AI-generated audio and likeness of Swift making dubious claims about free cookware sets for fans.

– Deepfakes can damage reputations, privacy and trust in media authenticity

In summary, this incident involving a highly realistic Taylor Swift deepfake shows how AI can be misused to spread misinformation and endanger people’s finances and data privacy. As deepfake technology proliferates, individuals and organizations must be more vigilant in identifying fraudulent content. Ongoing education about deepfakes and their risks is crucial.

,,"No, Taylor Swift isn't selling cookware","Over the last several weeks, a series of ads have appeared on Facebook featuring Taylor Swift’s voice encouraging “Swifties” to sign up to receive free Le Creuset cookware sets, all they had to do was click a link and provide some information about themselves.  While, as the New York Times reports, Swift is a fan of the brand — her collection has appeared in the background of the several Tumblr and Instagram accounts dedicated to her home decor — the advertisement was actually a scam. It was created using artificial intelligence technology that mimicked the singer’s voice, which was then laid over slips of Le Creuset Dutch ovens.

,,"Be careful out there: ""Taylor Swift fans scammed by fake AI-generated endorsement for Le Creuset cookware"""," The ad was on TikTok, too. I reported it once I saw it, but it was disturbing to have the algorithm promote it to me. I don't even think it was a ""sponsored' post, if I remember correctly  Goes on Youtube, scam ads everywhere. If it can happen on Youtube, it can happen eveywhere. Anything promoting/promising free high-end cookware is an automatic “that’s a scam” from me. I do like that color blue tho. Very 1989. Also, did anyone read the words “dental plan” in the article and immediately think “Lisa needs braces?” Sometimes when all is quiet, I just hear “dental plan — Lisa needs braces” in my head Surprised it didn't appear in my feed as Taylor and Le Creuset feels like the most targeted possible combination for me! Couldn't be me. Now if the scammer was promising free Staub? Here, just take my whole bank account. Love my Le Creuset, though. I don’t understand how people are dumb enough to fall for this kind of stuff. If a celebrity is involved in something their official social media will promote it. I think everyone has been burned once by something internet? You're tired after a long week and you're finishing up rushing thru emails and then for some dumb reason you click something you normally wouldn't? Once you've been burned, you learn the hard way and never do it again. Taylor doesn’t endorse anything, why would she suddenly endorse enameled cast iron?!

,,Taylor Swift fake AI ad dupes fans," Emma Stone comments on her 20-year friendship with Taylor Swift while accepting an award at the 2024 Golden Globes. A new ad featuring an AI-generated Taylor Swift offering a giveaway of high-end cookware is not the real deal. An ad for Le Creuset appeared on social media this month, featuring a likeness of Swift and a fake version of her voice with images of the company’s cookware to promote a giveaway, according to multiple outlets. ""Hey you all, it’s Taylor Swift here,"" the voice says, according to NBC News. ""Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets, so I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free."" A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, confirmed to Fox News Digital that the ad has been removed from the platform. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Taylor Swift's AI-generated likeness and voice were used in an unauthorized ad for cookware company Le Creuset. (Lionel Hahn/Getty Images) Le Creuset confirmed to Fox News Digital in a statement that neither they nor Swift were involved in the ad. ""Le Creuset is not involved with Taylor Swift for any consumer giveaway. All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts. Consumers should always check Le Creuset’s official social accounts and website before clicking on any suspicious ads."" Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment. AI expert Marva Bailer noted that whoever created the ad ""may be using AI, but a human made the choice to risk their reputation, consumer loyalty or their job by allowing ads that do not have contractual rights for endorsement. The idea that the picture is ‘entertainment,’ or this is for ‘fun’ does not equate in the world of business and brands. Marketing agencies and professionals for the most part are aware of these requirements."" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER In a statement to Fox News Digital, Le Creuset confirmed that neither they nor Swift were involved in any kind of promotion or giveaway. (Gareth Cattermole) She continued, ""With the age of AI, artificial intelligence, the barrier to entry to create and disseminate content is not limited to professionals. Free tools that create professional images and campaigns are launched in minutes reaching global audiences of millions.  The ‘meme’ culture of creating context for entertainment changes drastically when the content is used to represent brands and commerce without legal consent."" Bailer explained that with the tools available and their rapid evolution, ""The speed at which content is created and consumed is estimated at 4,000-10,000 ads per day. With our attention span of 8-seconds, less than that of a goldfish, it presents opportunities for fake ads to slip through. AI is leveraged to understand preferences and increase personalization. [There is] potential to create fake reviews to show interest, create visuals that show use of the product that are imaginary. The promise of happiness, beauty tied to a great deal and the quick press of the button may leave consumers disappointed."" Swift is just the latest celebrity who’s had their likeness used without permission by an AI-generated ad. ROBIN WILLIAMS’ DAUGHTER, AND TOM HANKS, KEIRA KNIGHTLEY AMONG STARS FIGHTING AGAINST AI Last year, actor Tom Hanks took to social media to warn fans that an ad using his name and likeness was a scam. ""There's a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it,"" he wrote, signing his name in a post on Instagram. Actress Scarlett Johansson planned to pursue legal action against an AI image-generating app called Lisa AI: 90s Yearbook & Avatar for her voice and likeness in an ad posted on X, formerly Twitter. Johansson’s lawyer told Variety, ""We do not take these things lightly. Per our usual course of action in these circumstances, we will deal with it with all legal remedies that we will have."" LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS Tom Hanks and Scarlett Johansson have both spoken out about the unapproved use of their likeness in AI-generated ads. (Getty Images) In the ad, posted on Oct. 28 but apparently no longer available, footage of Johansson behind the scenes on ""Black Widow"" is used, where she says, ""What’s up guys? It’s Scarlett and I want you to come with me …"" before a graphic covers her mouth and the screen shows AI-generated images that resemble her. There was fine print under the ad that read, ""Images produced by Lisa AI. It has nothing to do with this person."" Celebrities, or anyone having their likeness and voice used without permission, may have legal recourse in the future. According to Bloomberg Law, a proposed ""No Fakes Act"" was released in October as a discussion draft by a bipartisan group of senators.

,,We’ve Reached The Era Where Taylor Swift Is Duping Fans Into Signing Up For Cookware Giveaways. Thanks AI.,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Oh, boy... Taylor Swift has had a busy, well, two decades, but the past year or so has been especially eventful for the multi-talented singer/songwriter. From the whole Ticketmaster fiasco to her brain chemistry-altering Eras tour, and, of course, her romance with Travis Kelce and that unhappy reaction to Joy Koy’s Golden Globes joke at her expense, the “Anti-Hero” singer has been everywhere. Unfortunately for some fans, she has not been promoting cookware giveaways on social media, as we have AI to thank for that recent Swift appearance. While many people have probably wondered what life would be like if they were famous at one point or another, the reality is that it does come with some disadvantages, like scammers using your likeness/voice without permission to sell any number of dubious goods and services. Well, this is officially the era where it looked like Taylor Swift was duping fans into signing up for a cookware giveaway, as some AI generated ads hit Facebook and other social media platforms recently, where the singer appeared to be promoting a Le Creuset giveaway. It seems that the ad does feature some real video of the record-breaking chart-topper, but what likely really took most people in was the use of her voice, which was cobbled together using AI to make it sound like Swift was giving away the very expensive, 20-piece cookware sets “to my loyal fans, for free!” We don't know who actually put these ads together, or who was collecting the “small shipping fee of $9.96” (along with hidden monthly charges that didn’t result in any cookware being delivered) the New York Times reports that fans were hit with if they followed through with clicking on the link to apply for the giveaway. However, everyone who fell prey to the scam should just forgive themselves and try to get their money back.  First, it’s not like the 2024 Golden Globe nominee has never promoted any products before. In fact, you’ve probably seen her in multiple Capital One credit card commercials over the past few years. Also, Swift is, in fact, a noted “Lover” of the Le Creuset brand, and even gifted some items from the collection to a fan when she attended her bridal shower in 2014. On top of that, scammers who become proficient in AI programming have increasingly used computer generated likenesses of celebrities to dupe people into believing a number of schemes. Though the deepfakes of Tom Cruise from a few years ago were basically harmless and done to show just how convincing the tech can be, and “unreal” videos of Keanu Reeves on TikTok didn’t cause any undue harm, it’s obvious that the concern that AI deepfake technology would be used for nefarious purposes is pretty real.  Many of the fake-Taylor Swift ads have been pinpointed and taken down, and it would be best, if you find one, not to click on any links it provides.

The fraudulent ads, which have made the rounds on Facebook, use an AI version of Swift’s voice and appearance. In the ad, AI Swift claims she is giving free Le Creuset cookware sets to her “loyal fans.” Viewers are prompted to click on a button and answer a few questions in order to receive the free cookware set — any personal information entered is stolen by the scammers. Le Creuset says it has no involvement in the ads, reports The New York Times. Representatives for Swift have not provided comment on the videos. Celebrity deepfakes are gradually finding their way into advertising and media. In April, the Better Business Bureau warned consumers of a “rise in deepfake scams and ever-improving AI technology.” This technology creates deepfakes of “well-known and trusted celebrities” who give “phony endorsements.” These scams are now “more convincing than ever.” “Before you make a purchase, take a minute to reexamine the post and social media account,” the Better Business Bureau advised. “The photos and videos are most likely fake. If you make a purchase, you’ll lose money (often more than you expected) on a product that is substandard or doesn’t exist.” In recent years, several public figures have openly distanced themselves from ads featuring their AI-generated voice or likeness. Oprah Winfrey expressed frustration over the prevalence of fraudulent ads in 2022, when a fan asked her about weight loss gummies. “It’s come to my attention many times over, somebody’s out there misusing my name, even sending emails to people, advertising weight loss gummies,” she said in an Instagram video. “I don’t want you all to be taken advantage of by people misusing my name.” Journalist Gayle King asked her fans not to “be fooled” by AI-generated advertisements of her promoting a weight loss product. “They’ve manipulated my voice and video to make it seem like I’m promoting it,” King wrote in an Instagram post in October. “I’ve never heard of this product or used it!”   In June, fake ads of country singer Luke Combs promoting a weight loss product began spreading online. In the ad, a fake Combs claims he was recommended the product by fellow country singer Lainey Wilson. Wilson denounced the ads in an Instagram video, saying: “Surprise. It ain’t true. People will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it is lies. ... I don’t want y’all spending money on something that ain’t real.” The ads were also shut down by Combs’ manager, Chris Kappy. “These companies are out of the country and are using AI to create ads using the likeness of Luke and other celebrities,” Kappy wrote on Instagram. “AI is a scary thing and they’re using it against us.” Fears over the invasion of AI was a major motivator for the historic Hollywood strikes in 2023. Both the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Performers were striking in part for “protections against the use of artificial intelligence,” per CNBC. Agreements that ended the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes both addressed growing concerns over AI, with some protections put in place, as reported by the Deseret News. “I think SAG-AFTRA has kind of drawn a line in the sand as far as some of the first regulations on AI in entertainment and it’s kind of this sticker shock for everybody, like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is something that we have to think about,’” SAG-AFTRA strike captain Iris Liu told Rolling Stone at the conclusion of the 118-day strike. “I think we all need to direct our collective energy toward fighting for government regulation on this so that not only SAG-AFTRA actors are protected, but everybody, our whole world. We all need protection from misinformation.”  Even the most sought-after Hollywood stars have considered how AI could impact their careers. In October, Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks issued a warning to his fans when an AI version of himself promoting a “dental plan” began circling the internet. “Beware!!” Hanks began his warning via Instagram. “There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it.” Hanks previously addressed the unfolding potential of deepfake technology creeping into the creative world during an appearance on “The Adam Buxton Podcast.” After his death, he could still appear in movies, Hanks explained. “Anybody can now recreate themselves at any age they are by way of AI or deep fake technology. I could be hit by a bus tomorrow and that’s it, but performances can go on and on and on and on,” Hanks said. “Outside the understanding of AI and deepfake, there’ll be nothing to tell you that it’s not me and me alone. And it’s going to have some degree of lifelike quality. That’s certainly an artistic challenge but it’s also a legal one.” “Without a doubt, people will be able to tell (that it’s AI), but the question is, will they care? There are some people that won’t care, that won’t make that delineation.” AI resurrections aren’t yet commonplace in Hollywood, but they have happened in a handful of recent Hollywood blockbusters. The late Paul Walker made a posthumous return to the “Fast and Furious” film franchise in “Fast X.” Carrie Fisher was revived through AI for an appearance in “The Rise of Skywalker.” Bruce Lee, Audrey Hepburn, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed have all returned to the screen posthumously.

,,AI-generated deepfake ad uses Taylor Swift's likeness,"AI-generated scam ads featuring the likeness of Taylor Swift have been circulating on TikTok and Meta's Ad Library. The social media ads for Le Creuset products feature an AI version of Swift's voice, blending it with footage of her and Le Creuset cookware. The company has since confirmed that the giveaway is fake and a scam. More: Zoom out:  ",inside.com,https://inside.com/ai/posts/ai-generated-deepfake-ad-uses-taylor-swift-s-likeness-409678,
,,Watch: Taylor Swift used in deepfake Le Creuset ad,"  Celebrity’s image is used in AI-generated deepfake video endorsing a fake ‘giveaway’ Taylor Swift’s image has been used in an AI-generated deepfake scam video endorsing a fake Le Creuset cookware “giveaway”. 
A video being shared across various social media platforms purports to show the singer urging her fans to hand over their bank details for a chance to win one of 3,000 cookware sets.
In the deepfake clip using Swift’s likeness, the AI-generated voice says: “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.
“If you’re seeing this ad, you can get a free cookware set today – but just a heads-up, there are a few rules.”
The voice says fans should submit details in a form below the video.
They are then directed to a website where they are asked to provide a “small shipping fee of $9.96 (£7.82)”. However, the New York Times reports that those who gave over their card details were then hit with recurring charges.
“These will only be given out until the end of the day today so don’t hesitate,” the AI-generated Swift adds.
Several clips of the singer taken from a 2016 video interview with Vogue play throughout the bogus advert, alongside various images of Le Creuset products.
Fans are urged to act quickly as “supplies are limited”. The video then adds: “Thank you guys, for all your support.”
Swift, 34, is a known fan of the cookware brand, which appears in documentary scenes filmed at her home. In 2014, the popstar surprised a fan, Gena Gabrielle, by attending her bridal shower – bringing with her two Le Creuset items as gifts.
A spokesman for Le Creuset confirmed there was no giveaway promotion with Swift. 
They added: “All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts.”
It is unknown who is behind the scam, which has been posted across several Facebook groups before being rapidly deleted.
Text-to-speech platforms can allow criminal gangs to create deepfake videos quickly and cheaply. 
These services can translate a script into an AI-generated voice, and then pair the vocals with a video using lip-syncing software.
In Britain, one in 12 have already been targeted by cybercriminals impersonating their loved ones in this way, according to a study by McAfee, the software company, with 77pc of all victims losing money as a result.
A survey by the company found 95pc of people were unable to tell a fake AI-generated voice from a real one. 
Last year, fraudsters used an AI–generated deepfake video of trusted consumer champion Martin Lewis to convince victims to part with their money.
At the time, Mr Lewis said: “Government and regulators must step up to stop big tech publishing such dangerous fakes. People’ll lose money and it’ll ruin lives.”
Swift has been approached for comment. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, was also approached for comment.

,,Taylor Swift Fans Duped By AI-Generated Ads Using Pop Star’s Likeness In Fake Cookware Giveaway,"AI-generated videos of Taylor Swift’s likeness promoting a fraudulent Le Creuset cookware giveaway have tricked several fans into purchasing it. The deepfake videos feature what appears to be Swift doing a promotional pitch, per a CBS News report. The videos have been circulating on Facebook. “Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here,” the Swift replica can be heard saying in the video. “Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.” Viewers, whom the AI image addressed as “Swifties,” were then instructed by the faux Swift to click a button below the ad to complete a survey. The ad conveys a sense of urgency, saying that “supplies are running out.” People who clicked on the ad were sent to websites that appeared to be legitimate, like The Food Network. They were next shown fake news coverage of the product and testimonials by fake customers, per The New York Times. Scam victims were asked to pay a “small shipping fee of $9.96” for the cookware. They didn’t realize that paying that fee would lead to a hidden recurring charge and would not result in getting the pricey cookware at all.   A Facebook account called “The most profitable shares” promoted the deepfake video, though CBS News noted that it’s unclear who is behind it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP Fans were likely duped in part because Swift is known for her love of Le Creuset. In 2020, the brand shared an image on Facebook from the Grammy Award winner’s Netflix documentary “Miss Americana.” The post showed her in the kitchen using the brand’s round Dutch oven. This is not the first deepfake ad scam featuring a celebrity to make the rounds on social media. In October, Tom Hanks warned fans that he was not promoting a dental plan and that any ads featuring his likeness were fake, as The Daily Wire previously reported.  “BEWARE!! There’s a video out there promoting some dental plan with an AI version of me. I have nothing to do with it,” Hanks shared on Instagram at the time.  CBS Mornings host Gayle King’s AI likeness was also associated with a scam. King denied any connection to the fake weight loss-related video from a company called Artipet.

This article from Sinch Mailgun is the best I've seen so far: https://lnkd.in/eCfrhekT

The new rules apply to bulk senders, hitting >5k emails in one day to Gmail and Yahoo addresses.

Here's the TL;DR from the article - senders will need to:

- Authenticate their email: Senders will be required to verify their sender identities with standard protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

- Enable one-click unsubscribe: Senders will need to implement a single-click unsubscribe link within emails if they haven’t already, to allow recipients to easily opt out.

- Only send emails users want: Gmail and Yahoo are getting serious about spam monitoring and senders will need to ensure they’re keeping below a set spam rate threshold.

Most of these are key for deliverability anyway so you've probably got it covered - but always worth a check ✅

,,Swifties swindled by deepfake Taylor: Is AI moving too fast?,"Artificial intelligence is so sophisticated these days that it can use celebrities like Taylor Swift to scam people, and that's precisely what happened. Someone created a deepfake using Taylor Swift's image and voice for a Facebook ad claiming to give away Le Creuset cookware, but as it turns out, neither the cookware company nor Swift were involved. ""Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free,"" the deepfake of Swift says in the video. Switfites who clicked the link were directed to fake versions of reputable sites with phony articles about Le Creuset that prompted shoppers to provide $9.96 for shipping to get their free products. The Swift supporters received no cookware and, instead, were stuck with new fraudulent monthly charges added to their credit cards. Le Creuset has reported that no such giveaway was going on. KNX News' Chief Correspondent Charles Feldman spoke with Aaron Rafferty, a behavioral scientist, tech expert, and CEO of a tech startup called Standard DAO, who said while the technology isn't anything new, it has become more lifelike, and that presents some problems. ""There's many of these instances where you have lifelike and actual people with the same voice speaking in a manner that is very persuasive, and it's also potentially extremely hazardous to the human sentiment as well as the social condition,"" said Rafferty. Rafferty warns that the technology will only improve, and with the presidential election coming up, deepfakes could prove disruptive. ""There are companies today where anyone can create their own deepfake. [It] takes two minutes,"" Rafferty said. And while the latency for the tech is, at best, five seconds, in his view, it is a ways away from real-time fakes. While some reject calls for government intervention in the name of preserving innovation, Rafferty believes regulation is critical, saying this would be the government's opportunity to get on it before it's too late.

,,Miranda Lambert Warns Fans Of Cookbook Scam," Miranda Lambert’s new cookbook Y’all Eat Yet: Welcome to The Pretty B*tchin’ Kitchen is out today (4/25), and already her team has warned fans about a scam involving the new release. They posted a message to Twitter warning fans, “Hey yall. Please be aware that there is a scam going around promising to send you Miranda’s new cookbook plus a cookware set for free if you pay for shipping. This is NOT legit, and we are working to shut it down.” They continued, “You can order the book online from official sellers at yalleatyetbook.com. And Miranda’s cookware line, Wanda June Home, is available only from Walmart.” See that tweet here. Lambert said of her new book in a statement, “What started during the pandemic as me, my mom and her friends staying close, made me realize all the ways food brought us together for laughter, projects, escaping and even tough stuff. Then I thought, ‘Wouldn’t making one of those spiral-bound church cookbooks be cool?'” She added, “But once I got started, I realized with all that living, these women – beyond mom, Neicy, Heidi, and Vicki, there’s my grandma Nonny and her friends – really created a world that shaped who I was. That’s how Y’all Eat Yet? became so much more than just their recipes! It became a book about chasing my dream, how we live life and bring people together.” Miranda continued, “Good food nourishes the heart and the soul as much as the body. It doesn’t have to be fancy or hard to make; just something that tells people how loved and welcome they are. By stripping things down to the basics, whether it’s the holidays, glamping, or just sitting around playing songs, you can make being together special without much fuss. That’s how I was raised and try to live!” Tim made his Grand Ole Opry debut in December 2003. After that, he played it a few times, but never that much, and now he doesn’t play the Grand Ole Opry at all. Not sure why.  Faith played the Opry in the late 1990s when her career started to hit. She didn’t play the Opry stage much after that.  Vince Bucci/Getty Images George played the Grand Ole Opry show once, his debut performance on the stage in October of 1982. That was the first and last time, and no one really knows why. There is a theory that he could not make the Opry commitment to play the stage very much because he never lived in Nashville; he has always resided in Texas. Miranda played the Grand Ole Opry several times in her career, and some of her most recent performances on the Opry stage were in 2014 with then-husband Blake Shelton and in 2015 and 2016. She does not play it often now, and in 2015, she told me when asked about the Grand Ole Opry and someday becoming a member, “It’s sort of something I don’t talk about or have never asked or say that out loud. It was always a big deal to Blake, so that was something we always talked about, and he became a member, but I’d never really set it out for myself.” She added, “It wasn’t on my radar before because I focused on that for him, but I would definitely never say no to being a member of the Grand Ole Opry.”  Scott Gries/Getty Images Kenny made his Opry debut in 1996. He has been on the Opry stage a handful of times and once when he paid tribute to George Jones singing his classic, “White Lightning.” These days it’s very rare to see Chesney on the Grand Ole Opry stage.

,,Taylor Swift fans should watch out for bizarre new Le Creuset AI scam advert,"NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Taylor Swift’s likeness has been hijacked for a series of scam adverts using AI (artificial intelligence) to suggest the global pop icon is flogging Le Creuset cookware. The Cruel Summer hitmaker, who was in attendance at Sunday’s Golden Globes, is known to be a fan of the premium brand, which produces everything from casserole dishes and saucepans to stoneware storage pots, plates and bowls, in a variety of eye-catching colours. However, the 34-year-old star – who does not have a deal with Le Creuset – has appeared in social media ads for their products on platforms including Facebook. Le Creuset is also not involved in the creation of the videos. In them, the Anti-Hero singer appears to tell her fans she’s giving away cookware sets to ‘loyal fans’, thanks to the deepfake version of her face and voice. In the advert, fake Taylor is heard – and briefly seen – saying: ‘Hey y’all, it’s Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can’t sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I’m giving them away to my loyal fans for free.’     ‘If you’re seeing this ad, you can get a free cookware set today – but just a heads-up, there are a few rules,’ she continues. She then explains that US-based fans should click a button below and answer a few questions to be able to receive the Le Creuset items. After urging interested people to hurry as supplies are limited, the AI version of Taylor then adds: ‘Thank you guys, for all your support.’ However, the advert is reported to be a scam by The New York Times, as fans are directed to a website where they are asked to provide a ‘small shipping fee of $9.96 (£7.82)’.  According to the outlet though, buyers who have handed over their card details to pay this fee have subsequently been hit with recurring charges. ChatGPT has officially gone off the rails – spouting Latin and making up words AI predicts what Kurt Cobain would look like now on his 57th birthday Eamonn Holmes is (quite rightly) being dragged by Taylor Swift fans An AI chatbot has gone rogue and gave refund that airline has to honour Unsurprisingly, none of the promised Le Creuset cookware items have made it to them either. Le Creuset confirmed to Metro.co.uk that there was no consumer giveaway in place with the star. ‘All approved Le Creuset giveaways or promotions come from the official Le Creuset social accounts,’ a spokesperson added. Le Creuset also advised shoppers to check the brand’s official online accounts before clicking on suspicious ads. Taylor’s fondness for the brand has become evident thanks to a Tumblr account dedicated to her home décor, as well as featured in a Netflix documentary. She also gifted items from Le Creuset at a fan’s bridal shower back in 2014. Metro.co.uk has contacted reps for Taylor Swift for comment. Got a story?

,,TAYLOR SWIFT’S UNLIKELY CULINARY VENTURE – AI-GENERATED COOKWARE GIVEAWAYS RAISE EYEBROWS,"In a surprising turn of events, Taylor Swift finds herself entangled in a peculiar controversy involving AI-generated cookware giveaways. Fans were taken aback as they stumbled upon ads circulating on social media platforms, seemingly endorsed by the multi-talented singer.  These ads, cleverly crafted using artificial intelligence, urged fans to participate in a Le Creuset cookware giveaway. The real twist lies in the fact that Swift had no hand in this promotional endeavor. The question arises: How did fans fall victim to a cookware giveaway scam, and who is responsible for orchestrating this deceptive AI-driven campaign? The world is no stranger to the multifaceted Taylor Swift, whose recent years have been marked by controversies and triumphs alike. However, the newest chapter in her saga involves an unlikely culinary venture orchestrated by artificial intelligence. Fans were led to believe that Swift was endorsing a cookware giveaway, enticing them with the promise of a 20-piece Le Creuset set “for free.” The catch? A seemingly nominal shipping fee of $9.96, coupled with hidden monthly charges that left participants empty-handed. The AI-generated ads cleverly incorporated real video footage of the chart-topping artist, but the true deception lay in the synthesized voiceovers that mimicked Swift, urging her loyal fans to seize the apparent opportunity. The lingering question remains: Who masterminded this elaborate ruse, and what motivated them to exploit the singer’s image and voice for a fraudulent cookware promotion? For those quick to dismiss the idea of Taylor Swift promoting products, it’s worth noting that the singer has a history of endorsing brands. Capital One credit card commercials have featured Swift in recent years, showcasing her versatility beyond the realm of music. Swift has publicly expressed her admiration for the Le Creuset brand, gifting items from their collection to a fan during a 2014 bridal shower. The scammers’ choice of cookware was not entirely arbitrary, exploiting Swift’s genuine affinity for Le Creuset. The emergence of AI-generated deepfakes in recent years has posed significant challenges, with scammers increasingly harnessing this technology to execute deceptive schemes. While past instances, like the harmless deepfakes of Tom Cruise, were crafted for entertainment and demonstration purposes, the misuse of AI deepfake technology for fraudulent activities is becoming a tangible concern. The wave of fake Taylor Swift ads serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with AI-generated content. As technology advances, the line between reality and fabrication blurs, leaving unsuspecting fans vulnerable to scams. The culprits behind these deceptive cookware giveaways remain elusive, their motives shrouded in mystery. As authorities work to take down these fraudulent campaigns, the public is urged to exercise caution and refrain from clicking on links provided by dubious AI-generated advertisements. The aftermath of the AI-generated cookware giveaway scam raises pertinent questions about online safety and the exploitation of celebrity likeness through advanced technologies. Many of the fake Taylor Swift ads have been identified and removed, but the damage has been done for those who unwittingly parted with their money in pursuit of a non-existent culinary windfall. In a world increasingly dominated by AI, where even the voices of our beloved celebrities can be replicated with alarming accuracy, how can we protect ourselves from falling victim to such scams? The onus falls not only on platforms to enhance their scrutiny of content but also on users to exercise discernment when encountering enticing offers online. As the investigation into the perpetrators of this deceptive AI campaign continues, the broader conversation around the responsible use of AI technology and the need for robust safeguards gains momentum. The Taylor Swift cookware giveaway saga serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the digital landscape and the potential consequences of unchecked AI advancements. As technology evolves, so must our awareness and vigilance in navigating the intricate web of online interactions. How can we strike a balance between embracing technological progress and safeguarding ourselves from the pitfalls it presents? The quest for answers continues, urging us to reflect on the evolving intersection of AI, celebrity culture, and online security. Disclaimer. The information provided is not trading advice.

,,TAYLOR SWIFT DEEPFAKE ADS—WHAT BRANDS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GENERATIVE AI RISKS AFTER PHONY LE CREUSET PROMO,"                 Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and other celebrities have been deepfaked in ads on social media. Deepfake Taylor Swift is like the Oprah of Facebook giveaways—everyone who clicks gets an iPhone, a Dutch oven, a $500 gift card. Except the fake Swift ads are social media scams involving offers for iPhones, stainless steel Stanley tumblers, Le Creuset cookware, Visa gift cards, or anything to induce a click from an unsuspecting fan. The ads are phony, using deepfake artificial intelligence to impersonate the superstar on platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. The ads reflect a darker side of AI that is starting to corrupt the ad world and beyond, causing trouble for brands.      Similar ads have used other fake endorsements—from actress Selena Gomez, billionaire Elon Musk and podcaster Joe Rogan. In one Facebook ad, an AI-generated voice of Rogan asks fans to enter a crossbow giveaway. Musk’s fake ad claims it will double a person’s bitcoin if they first send the cryptocurrency to him. The ads are “deepfakes, cheap fakes and shallow fakes,” said Philip Cowdell, global chief strategy officer at social media and digital video marketing firm Channel Factory. Cowdell has studied the rise of AI in advertising, where generative AI has made creative tools more accessible for legitimate marketing. But the technology is also wreaking havoc on the online information landscape in ways that are detrimental to brands, celebrities and the general public discourse.      Besides Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, AI-generated marketing material has appeared everywhere from YouTube to TikTok. The ads sometimes use sophisticated deepfake technology that recreates a celebrity’s image with almost complete accuracy. Other times the fakes are less convincing, what Cowdell would call “cheap fakes,” and they don’t require generative AI at all. For instance, a scammer could use real video of Swift and dub over it with any voice, and that could still fool consumers, Cowdell said. “All this disinformation is now cheaper and easier to make and disseminate, and it is going to fuel polarization,” Cowdell said. “It used to be hard and expensive, and now it’s cheap and prevalent, and social media is the easiest way to push it out to the world. That’s not good for consumer confidence.” Also read: General Mills combats AI deepfakes A search across platforms shows that AI-generated fakes are everywhere. The ad world has helped spearhead AI adoption, embracing tools such as ChatGPT for text generation and Midjourney for image creation, and they streamlined ad production. Top brands from Coca-Cola to Mondelēz have accepted the AI call, using the technology to upgrade their marketing. Last year, Coca-Cola, created a website where consumers could generate images using its marketing assets. The site is called “Create Real Magic,” and shows how some brands see AI as a way to democratize access to their advertising and give people power to shape how they interact with the companies. At the same time, though, bad actors have used similar tools to build fake ads, misleading websites and spin disinformation. And the largest digital platforms, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, TikTok and more, are having trouble separating the good AI from the bad, according to ad leaders, who are trying to figure out how to incorporate AI while being vigilant about abuse. “We’ve been banging on about the absolute wonders and unlimited potential of AI, particularly in the creative world and the business world,” said Ellie Bamford, chief strategy officer, North America at VML. “It’s an exciting moment, but this is a very serious moment.” Bamford is particularly concerned about disinformation during the U.S. elections this year and with the proliferation of deepfake pornography. There needs to be regulations, Bamford said.  “It’s time for a pivot and for us to really discuss the serious impact of what this is going to do,” Bamford said. “We need better detection and removal policies.”  Meta and Google declined interviews for this story. They did point to their ad policies that prohibit scam ads, and newer rules that address manipulated media. Meta, for instance, has a lengthy policy against “fraud and deception,” and said it removed 1.3 billion accounts from October 2022 to December 2022 for violating those rules, its most recent stat. Meta considers the fake Swift ads a form of “celeb-bait,” and these types of scams have plagued the internet for years, even before the recent AI boom, a Meta representative said in an email. Meta is investing significantly to combat such scams, but the attackers are always getting more sophisticated. For instance, a fraudulent ad could fool Meta’s detection systems, using a method called cloaking, which hides the content of the ad from the moderation system. On Google’s YouTube, meanwhile, there have been ads that use AI-generated voiceovers that mimic popular personalities. There also is a whole genre of AI-generated videos from accounts that create commercials and use brands’ logos and jingles, including Oreo, Arby’s, Chevrolet, Burger King and others. In most cases, the AI videos appear harmless, or even funny, but in some cases they insert politically charged messages or push cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin, the popular memecoin. A Google spokesperson said that the platform requires creators to label synthetic material accordingly, a policy it announced last year. Google said it removed 5.2 billion ads in 2022 for policy violations and suspended more than 6.7 million ad accounts in 2022. The Google rep also said that the company is aware of the emerging “deepfake celebrity endorsement” trend and that it is investing heavily to combat it. Brands and advertisers are worried about the abuse of AI and how it could affect their operations, according to Nicole Denman Greene, VP analyst at research firm Gartner. A recent Gartner study found that 55% of brand reputation leaders said generative AI poses a risk to their brands, Greene said. Part of that risk is the proliferation of misinformation created with the help of AI and deepfake scams that co-opt their brands. “There’s a lot of work for brands and their agencies to do right now,” Greene said. “They’re going to have to manage both the consumer and business risks as generative AI content and adoption increases.” The fraudulent Swift ads promoted Le Creuset cookware, a brand that Swift has been known to like. Other social media ads, with digitally altered celebrity endorsements, hawked iPhones, as well as gift cards for Visa and Walmart. “You need to monitor your brand, and you need to understand what is, and what isn’t, part of your brand [identity],” Greene said. “That will help you when generative AI content of your brand is out there.” A YouTube creator makes fake ads for Oreo, which appear to be innocuous but they show the interest in making fake ads. Fans of Burger King’s Whopper jingle create AI-generated videos on YouTube. Gartner found that 60% of chief marketing officers will likely adopt technology that can help authenticate content, which could be used to prove when digital material is actually from the brand. Brands could also use this technology to authenticate user-generated AI content. They should also enhance online monitoring to watch out for when trademarks are being abused, Greene said. Cybersecurity software firm McAfee is working on a deepfake audio detection system. The firm found that nearly 70% of Americans said deepfakes make it hard to trust what they see online, according to a recent study by McAfee. “AI-generated voices can be used for a wide range of purposes,” said Steve Grobman, McAfee’s chief technology officer. “Some of them can be nefarious, traditional scams that can be enhanced by a celebrity hawking a product.” Another crafty scam that spread online recently featured MrBeast, the popular YouTuber, according to Grobman. The video used real footage of MrBeast, aka Jimmy Donaldson, but inserted deepfake audio to promote a gambling app. It was one of many online scams that misappropriated MrBeast’s image. In some cases, these scams are directly related to advertising, Grobman said, because they prompt consumers to download apps or visit websites that monetize by serving ads. Some advertisers have been taking deepfakes seriously. Last year, General Mills tapped Zefr, a third-party brand suitability measurement firm, to monitor ad campaigns on social media to quantify the level of AI-generated misinformation. Zefr delivers post-campaign reports from TikTok, YouTube and Meta to understand the level of misinformation that appeared near an ad. What is and isn’t misinformation is defined by standards set by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media. There is a dilemma, however, in advertising regarding how to handle generative AI. Deepfakes have opened access to marketing potential, especially for small businesses. In 2022, Queen Latifah teamed up with Lenovo and allowed her AI likeness to be used in small business advertising in the U.S. and Canada. That’s the type of celebrity deepfake that most brands can get behind, said Bamford of VML. “Creatively, with our agencies, deepfakes have been used as an interesting creative tool to create scale and to unlock access to celebrities,” Bamford said. “It can be tapped into as a positive thing, and I think that’s really interesting, but there is a whole other side of this and it’s worth calling attention to.” In this article: Garett Sloane is Ad Age’s technology, digital and media reporter.

,,Taylor Swift AI Scam Sees Singer Slinging Artisan Cookware,"Taylor Swift may get a lot of airtime at NFL games and award shows, but that doesn't mean you should believe it when you see her selling cookware on social media. In the internet's latest “Wait, what?” moment, the iconic singer has found herself the subject of an insidious AI scam. AI deepfake technology has gotten a little too good over the years, leading to a wide range of celebrity doppelgangers being used to scam unsuspecting users out of their online data and personal finances. Now, one featuring the famous “Anti-hero” singer's likeness is being used to sell Le Creuset products to unsuspecting users on social media. As if anyone needed another reason to splurge on artisan cookware during a global economic crisis.  Get the latest tech news, straight to your inbox Stay informed on the top business tech stories with Tech.co's weekly highlights reel. According to a report from the New York Times, a deepfake AI scam has been showing up on social media platforms like TikTok and Facebook that shows Taylor Swift promoting, endorsing, and even giving away Le Creuset cookware products. The actual video features the likeness of the singer, as well as a synthetic version of her voice using phrases like “Swifties” to convince users of its authenticity. Even worse, Taylor Swift is a known lover of Le Creuset products, with her cookware appearing in exposés and documentaries on multiple occasions, which lends even more credibility to the recent scam. 🔎 Want to browse the web privately? 🌎 Or appear as if you're in another country?

Then, of course, they're asked to provide financial information to cover the shipping for their free cookware, which is now in the hands of scammers to do with it what they please. While Taylor Swift is one of the most famous AI deepfakes to pop up lately, she's certainly not the only celebrity likeness that has been used to scam users out of their money and personal data. In fact, the likeness of MrBeast was used in a scam last year that saw the most popular YouTuber in the world giving away iPhones on social media. Given the MrBeast's proclivity towards charity, the claim is far from farfetched, which is a notable theme across these kinds of scams. Other celebrity deekfake scams that have popped up over the years include Tom Hanks, Gayle King, Steve Harvey, Ice Cube, Oprah and even The Rock. Now that you know your favorite celebrities could be lurking on social media platforms waiting to trick you into buying stuff that will never show up, you probably want to learn how to spot these kinds of scams. After all, most people can't spot deepfakes on their own, so a little help can go a long way. First off, a simple online search of the endorsement or giveaway will almost always yield the information you need. In fact, these kinds of scams are tracked by websites just like Tech.co, so you can keep an eye out for known threats to your online security. There are also AI image detectors out there, but in most cases, an inquisitive eye should be able to discern the authenticity of a deepfake. Simply put, thinking critically about a celebrity endorsement before handing over your financial data is always a good start to avoiding scams.

Share your insights with us Fake adverts generated using AI used the likeness of Taylor Swift appearing to endorse a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway to steal money and data. In one of the videos, 'Swift' says 'Hey y'all, it's Taylor Swift here. Due to a packaging error, we can't sell 3,000 Le Creuset cookware sets. So I'm giving them away to my loyal fans for free.' Users were then directed from the ads, which ran on Facebook, tikiTok and other sites, to survey questions requesting personal information and a payment that supposedly covers shipping costs for the 'free' product.  According to the New York Times, the fake promotional videos featured an uncanny Swift lookalike that was created with AI technology to replicate her appearance and voice.

,,Look What You Made Me Do: Why Deepfake Taylor Swift Matters,"NEWARK, NEW JERSEY - SEPTEMBER 12: Taylor Swift attends the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards at the ... [+] Taylor Swift’s famous lyric “look what you made me do” took on a new meaning recently as scammers used artificial intelligence technology to create a synthetic version of the singer’s voice which, cobbled together with footage of her standing beside Le Creuset Dutch ovens, falsely offered free cookware sets. This type of fabrication is a “deepfake,” something that uses artificial intelligence technology to create a seemingly real video or audio clip that mimics a person’s face, voice, or both. The level of verisimilitude that deepfakes can create is both impressive and alarming. Before panicking, though, it’s worth considering the pros, cons and media’s current response to these concerns. The Downside With the Le Creuset incident fresh in our minds, it’s not hard to see the problems deepfake technology can present. Many celebrities, in addition to Swift, such as media mogul Oprah Winfrey, entrepreneur Martha Stewart, actor Tom Hanks, journalist Gayle King, and YouTube personality MrBeast have all been fabricated and used to either scam people or promote products that the celebrity doesn’t actually endorse. But it’s not just celebrities that are at risk of being deepfaked. Regular people can be synthesized as well, like Clive Kabatznik, an investor in Florida whose “voice” was used by scammers to try and wire money out of Kabatznik’s account. The Upside Deepfakes may be scary—as new things generally are—but they’re not all bad. They can be used to create more realistic visual effects in movies or to generate realistic simulations for training purposes. Beyond training, there are even broader applications in education; deepfakes can assist a teacher in delivering engaging lessons that would go beyond traditional visual and media formats. A “deepfaked” video of reenactments or hearing firsthand from an historical figure will be much more memorable than reading a textbook or hearing a lecture. Deepfakes can also support activists and journalists, allowing them to remain anonymous in oppressive or dictatorial regimes. PROMOTED That being said, one of the most compelling upsides to deepfake technology is presented by Jessica Silbey & Woodrow Hartzog, who postulate that deepfakes don’t create new problems so much as make existing problems worse, “There have been cracks in the system for awhile now, and deep fakes might just be what breaks them wide open and presents an opportunity for us to repair them.” Silbey & Hartzog are particularly bullish on the opportunities for improvement regarding education, journalism, and representative democracy. The Safe Side So, the question then becomes: what do we do to protect ourselves? Media organizations are already being impressively proactive. The Wall Street Journal has a division of 21 journalists whose job it is to combat misinformation, particularly deepfakes. The Washington Post has added a team of video experts to their fake news detection team specifically in order to counter deepfakes. And Reuters is collaborating with Meta to detect deepfakes, and even has a course devoted to debunking them. Print media aren’t the only ones taking precautions. Internet-based companies are also being proactive. Google GOOG +1.2% has volunteered their datasets of manipulated and non-manipulated videos for the research community. X (formerly known as Twitter) has its own protocols, using a set of four rules to combat deepfakes: identification through notice tweets, warning of manipulated content before sharing it, inclusion of a link to genuine news articles explaining the manipulation, and elimination of potentially safety-endangering materials. Meta, with the help of fact-checking organizations, makes its best effort to delete faked materials from their social network. And, on top of their collaboration with Reuters, Meta has financed an initiative called, the Deepfake Detection Challenge. Forbes Daily: Get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.    The Bright Side Thankfully, as explained by Peter Soufleris, chief executive of IngenID, a voice biometrics technology vendor, “Synthetic speech leaves artifacts behind, and a lot of anti-spoofing algorithms key off those artifacts.” That being said, the technology is going to improve. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” says Dr. Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” He added that it’s now possible to make a “decent-quality video” in less than 45 minutes. This trend means that the defensive mechanisms will need to improve as well, and we can’t just count on technology to protect us. In April of 2023, the Better Business Bureau put out an article telling people how to spot fake celebrity scams. It’s helpful when consumers are vigilant, and even more helpful when the folks behind the tech are also trying to do the right thing. While the deepfake of Taylor Swift brings to light the risks and ethical concerns surrounding the use of deepfakes, deepfake Tom Cruise is attempting to present a model of acceptable deepfaking behavior. Tom Graham, a London-based tech entrepreneur and co-founder of Metaphysic, the company behind @deeptomcruise asserts that, “The technology is moving forward, whether anybody likes it, really.” His company’s goal is to “really, really focus on trying to develop our product in a way” that avoids adding to the harmful deepfakes already being created by others. Deepfakes are not the first instance of media being potentially harmful. Like all the media that has come before it, deepfakes have the potential to do as much good as they do harm. Maybe there’s a reason Swift hasn’t commented on the Le Creuset debacle; it’s possible her lyric of choice is “You need to calm down.” Falon Fatemi is the CEO of Fireside which she co-founded with Mark Cuban.

The real twist lies in the fact that Swift had no hand in this promotional endeavor. The question arises: How did fans fall victim to a cookware giveaway scam, and who is responsible for orchestrating this deceptive AI-driven campaign? The world is no stranger to the multifaceted Taylor Swift, whose recent years have been marked by controversies and triumphs alike. However, the newest chapter in her saga involves an unlikely culinary venture orchestrated by artificial intelligence. Fans were led to believe that Swift was endorsing a cookware giveaway, enticing them with the promise of a 20-piece Le Creuset set “for free.” The catch? A seemingly nominal shipping fee of $9.96, coupled with hidden monthly charges that left participants empty-handed. The AI-generated ads cleverly incorporated real video footage of the chart-topping artist, but the true deception lay in the synthesized voiceovers that mimicked Swift, urging her loyal fans to seize the apparent opportunity. The lingering question remains: Who masterminded this elaborate ruse, and what motivated them to exploit the singer’s image and voice for a fraudulent cookware promotion? For those quick to dismiss the idea of Taylor Swift promoting products, it’s worth noting that the singer has a history of endorsing brands. Capital One credit card commercials have featured Swift in recent years, showcasing her versatility beyond the realm of music. Swift has publicly expressed her admiration for the Le Creuset brand, gifting items from their collection to a fan during a 2014 bridal shower. The scammers’ choice of cookware was not entirely arbitrary, exploiting Swift’s genuine affinity for Le Creuset. The emergence of AI-generated deepfakes in recent years has posed significant challenges, with scammers increasingly harnessing this technology to execute deceptive schemes. While past instances, like the harmless deepfakes of Tom Cruise, were crafted for entertainment and demonstration purposes, the misuse of AI deepfake technology for fraudulent activities is becoming a tangible concern. The wave of fake Taylor Swift ads serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with AI-generated content. As technology advances, the line between reality and fabrication blurs, leaving unsuspecting fans vulnerable to scams. The culprits behind these deceptive cookware giveaways remain elusive, their motives shrouded in mystery. As authorities work to take down these fraudulent campaigns, the public is urged to exercise caution and refrain from clicking on links provided by dubious AI-generated advertisements. The aftermath of the AI-generated cookware giveaway scam raises pertinent questions about online safety and the exploitation of celebrity likeness through advanced technologies. Many of the fake Taylor Swift ads have been identified and removed, but the damage has been done for those who unwittingly parted with their money in pursuit of a non-existent culinary windfall. In a world increasingly dominated by AI, where even the voices of our beloved celebrities can be replicated with alarming accuracy, how can we protect ourselves from falling victim to such scams? The onus falls not only on platforms to enhance their scrutiny of content but also on users to exercise discernment when encountering enticing offers online. As the investigation into the perpetrators of this deceptive AI campaign continues, the broader conversation around the responsible use of AI technology and the need for robust safeguards gains momentum. The Taylor Swift cookware giveaway saga serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the vulnerabilities in the digital landscape and the potential consequences of unchecked AI advancements. As technology evolves, so must our awareness and vigilance in navigating the intricate web of online interactions. How can we strike a balance between embracing technological progress and safeguarding ourselves from the pitfalls it presents? The quest for answers continues, urging us to reflect on the evolving intersection of AI, celebrity culture, and online security. Read More In a groundbreaking move, a group of Hong Kong-based researchers has spearheaded an initiative to revolutionize education by introducing a comprehensive framework centered around the realms of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.  The AI4K12 initiative aims to familiarize young students with the rapidly evolving landscape of these emerging technologies, tailoring its approach to K-12 education. The initiative unfolds through five pivotal principles, addressing crucial aspects of AI and robotics education for the formative years of students. Under the AI4K12 framework, the first big idea involves immersing students in the concept of AI and robotic perception. Teachers are encouraged to employ diverse learning techniques to convey the idea that AI-based robots perceive their environment through sensors.  Weipeng Yang, an assistant professor at the Education University of Hong Kong, emphasizes the importance of distinguishing AI’s unique perception process from that of humans, ensuring children acknowledge the distinctive features that complement human qualities. The second principle mandates students to familiarize themselves with AI reasoning, delving into the introduction of algorithms and codes. This step aims to lay the groundwork for young minds to comprehend the intricate processes behind AI decision-making. Yang insists that this early exposure will empower students to navigate the digital society’s complexities effectively, shaping responsible AI users from a young age. Building on the foundation of reasoning, the third principle focuses on understanding AI models’ learning capabilities. Students are introduced to the concept that AI can learn through processing data, instilling a crucial understanding of AI’s adaptive nature. This principle aims to cultivate a generation aware of AI’s dynamic functionalities, setting the stage for future innovations driven by informed minds. The fourth ambit of the framework emphasizes that AI and robotic systems lack consciousness but are powerful tools with communication abilities. Students are encouraged to recognize AI as a human-made tool rather than an autonomous entity. This distinction ensures a pragmatic understanding of AI’s role as a collaborative partner, aligning with human intentions. The final principle underscores the importance of students familiarizing themselves with the societal and long-term impacts of widespread AI usage. Weipeng Yang envisions that integrating AI education from preschool onward will contribute to effective AI tool application in the evolving digital society, ensuring safe and responsible AI usage. While technology firms introduce AI models to enhance student learning, concerns emerge over the emotional well-being of students relying on AI chatbots. UNESCO warns about potential harm to emotional health, advocating for human interaction with teachers. Organizations propose higher age limits for AI usage and advocate integration with emerging technologies to safeguard young learners’ privacy. UNESCO Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, stresses the need for public engagement, safeguards, and government regulations to navigate the challenges associated with AI integration into education. The debate revolves around balancing the opportunities for human development with potential harms and prejudices that AI, especially generative AI, may bring to the educational landscape. To ensure AI’s lawful operation and resilience against challenges, proponents argue for the integration of an enterprise blockchain system. This system guarantees data input quality and ownership, providing a secure environment for AI to thrive. The immutability of data becomes a crucial aspect, aligning blockchain technology as the backbone supporting the evolution of AI. As Hong Kong researchers pioneer the AI4K12 initiative, transforming education with a comprehensive AI and robotics curriculum, the broader educational community grapples with concerns surrounding the use of AI chatbots in schools.  How can society strike a balance between embracing the innovative potential of AI in education and safeguarding the emotional well-being and privacy of young learners? The dialogue continues, urging stakeholders to collaboratively shape the future of AI in education while ensuring responsible and ethical integration.

,,Taylor Swift the latest celebrity to get the deepfake treatment as AI-generated image used in scam,"If you’ve seen an ad on Facebook lately featuring Taylor Swift talking up Le Creuset cookware, beware — it’s a fake. Swift is the latest celebrity to find herself at the centre of a deepfake scam. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Taylor Swift the latest celebrity to get deepfaked. Stream the world's best reality, entertainment and true-crime shows free on 7plus >> The bogus ad uses AI to fake Tay-Tay’s face and voice as she extols the virtues of Le Creuset, with fans told they could win a free cookware set from the pricey brand. “In several ads, Ms Swifts cloned voice addressed ‘Swifties’ ... and said she was thrilled to be handing out free cookware sets,” The New York Times reported. “All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.” Le Creuset said it had played no part in the deepfake ads and urged its customers to be careful about which links they clicked on when browsing social media. Swift’s likeness was probably used because she has a known fondness for the Le Creuset brand. Her collection of Le Creuset cookware even features on a Tumblr account dedicated to her home decor, so it would be easy for fans to assume the deepfake ad is legitimate. But Swift is just one in a long and ever-growing list of celebrities to suffer the fate of being used for AI-created scams. In October last year, actor Tom Hanks, journalist Gayle King and YouTuber Mr Beast were all subjected to AI scams involving fake ads for dental plans, iPhone giveaways and so on. As AI develops and deepfake videos begin to look more and more realistic, the problem is unlikely to go away any time soon. Experts say the Taylor Swift scam involved AI technology which created a synthetic version of the singer’s voice cobbled together from footage of her, alongside clips showing Le Creuset items. Representatives for Swift have not yet commented on the scam. Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor at the University of Buffalo in the US, told The New York Times it was getting easier and faster to create deepfake videos. “These tools are becoming very accessible these days,” Dr Lye said, adding it was now possible to make a “decent-quality video” in under 45 minutes. “It’s becoming very easy, and that’s why we’re seeing more.” For more engaging celebrity content, visit 7Life on Facebook.

,,AI Scammers Use Taylor Swift's Deepfake in Le Creuset Cookware Ads,"   Follow Us The digital world has been stirred by a recent scam harnessing the power of advanced Artificial Intelligence technology. Fraudsters have created deceptive advertisements featuring a deepfake of globally acclaimed artist, Taylor Swift, falsely endorsing Le Creuset cookware. Despite Swift's known affinity for the brand, she has not officially endorsed the product, and these fraudulent advertisements were created without her involvement. The scam ads, widely circulated on platforms such as Facebook and TikTok, used AI to mimic Swift's voice and image. They promoted a nonexistent giveaway of free Le Creuset sets, enticing consumers into clicking a link and paying a 'small shipping fee'. Subsequently, consumers found themselves trapped in a hidden monthly charge, with the promised cookware never materializing. The scam reached another level of duplicity with the creation of fake news coverage and customer testimonials on hoax websites, meticulously designed to resemble legitimate ones like the Food Network. Dr. Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor, highlighted the growing accessibility of text-to-speech and deepfake technology. This, in turn, has facilitated the emergence of such cons. Furthermore, Swift isn’t the first celebrity to be exploited in this manner. Other well-known figures such as Joanna Gaines, Lainey Wilson, and Ree Drummond have also fallen victim to similar schemes. Le Creuset has confirmed the absence of any partnership with Swift, urging customers to purchase only from their official channels and remain alert to suspicious ads. Representatives for Taylor Swift have yet to comment on the issue. Meanwhile, McAfee Corp announced its AI-powered Deepfake Audio Detection technology, known as Project Mockingbird, at the Consumer Electronics Show. Developed to protect consumers against cybercriminals utilizing fabricated AI-generated audio for scam purposes, this technology could provide a vital defense against scams impersonating celebrities like Swift.

,,Taylor Swift is latest celeb to get deep faked,"KTLA      by: David Lazarus Posted: Jan 9, 2024 / 02:31 PM PST Updated: Jan 9, 2024 / 06:46 PM PST Commentary    If you saw an ad on Facebook or another platform recently that features Taylor Swift extolling the virtues of Le Creuset cookware and kitchen gear, you were had. Yes, Swift is a fan of the brand. But no, that’s not her voice, realistic though it may seem. Tay-Tay is the latest celebrity to have his or her voice or image deep faked with AI technology to dupe you into thinking the celeb endorses a product or organization. Tom Hanks, Gayle King and YouTube personality MrBeast have similarly been deep faked with bogus AI versions of themselves. As the New York Times reports, someone coupled a synthetic version of Swift’s voice with old footage of her alongside Le Creuset Dutch ovens. “In several ads,” the Times reported, “Ms. Swift’s cloned voice addressed ‘Swifties’ — her fans — and said she was ‘thrilled’ to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.” Le Creuset says it played no role in the deep-fake ads and urged shoppers to be wary of clicking on suspicious marketing. This is the latest example of how AI can be used by scammers to trick people into thinking an offering is legitimate. After all, if Swift supports it, it must be good. In the past, such ploys were often transparent to anyone who took the time to wonder why an A-list celebrity would be stooping to product pitches. But AI has grown so sophisticated so quickly that it’s harder than ever to tell what’s bogus and what isn’t. That’s why it’s vital that lawmakers step up, fast, with regulations for this technology. As it stands, there are currently no federal laws addressing AI scams. Two bills — the Deepfakes Accountability Act in the House and the No Fakes Act in the Senate — are currently pending. But they focus more on disclosure or seeking permission to use a celebrity’s voice or likeness. That’s a start. But scammers aren’t known for following rules or seeking permission to fool people. To nip this problem in the bud, online platforms need to be held accountable for the content they run, including ads. It’s not that difficult. Any sensible Facebook employee should have wondered if someone of Swift’s stature would really be selling utensils or whatever. If the veracity of the ad can’t be confirmed, it shouldn’t be posted. Period. Digital technology continues to be light years ahead of existing laws and regulations. We need to catch up, and we need to do it now. And social media need to be held accountable for ensuring users aren’t being taken to the cleaners (or the kitchen) by deep fakes.   Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

,,,"  The explosion of artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and integrations in recent years has sent sepia-toned twentieth-century legal doctrines scrambling to keep up with decidedly technicolor twenty-first century technology. As more and more companies and consumers continue down the yellow brick road of using AI to buy and sell products and services, 2024 is set to be a year in which advertising law comes to the forefront to address the dramatic increase in false and misleading commercial information entering the marketplace that is generated by or associated with AI. 2023 brought countless legal questions and lawsuits over whether the training of generative AI constituted copyright infringement (or fair use) as regulatory and legal frameworks attempted to wrap their hands around what AI is or can be. As we move into 2024, the legal focus is poised to respond to AI’s undeniable potential – and nascent implementation – for use in advertising. In traditional consumer retail, there has been an explosion of AI-enabled “try-on” features, personalized product consultations and chat bot influencers, as well as a surge of increasingly tailored and specifically targeted advertising based on a consumer’s online and even offline behavior. And in the B2B context, companies race to find ways to make their products and services more efficient (and competitive) through AI enhancements and integrations, which they then use to market those offerings. AI’s growing prominence in advertising brings increased legal risk and scrutiny – from government regulators, competitors, consumer advocacy groups, and more. The variety of AI-related use cases each implicate different aspects of regulation, including different regulators: Consumer protection agencies have noted the potential discriminatory impacts of advertising practices based on biased algorithms, and the possible associated liabilities. There has been an uptick in activity from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) expressing concern over claims relating to AI, including how it was trained, what benefits it provides, whether it functions as advertised, and whether technology is properly characterized as ""AI."" Potential exists for Lanham Act false advertising claims, particularly to the extent AI-related representations are deemed material. Perennial advertising topics such as basic accuracy, claim substantiation, and the potential use of deepfakes are slated to rise to the forefront of public and legal awareness. We’re already seeing increased activity across these channels. Last month, AI-generated video scams duped consumers into believing Taylor Swift was giving away “free” sets of Le Creuset cookware – in exchange for a “small shipping fee” of course – with the ads using AI-generated versions of the singer’s face and voice. Ms. Swift is just the latest in a line of celebrities contending with AI versions of themselves being used to peddle deceptive products and services. Actress Scarlett Johansson, for example, sent a cease & desist letter back in November to the company behind an AI image and voice simulation mobile app that purportedly used “deepfakes” of Ms. Johansson in its advertisement for the app. The US Congress has even taken note of this increase in deepfake advertising and introduced legislation to address it with the “Defending Each and Every Person from False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject to Accountability Act of 2021” [DEEP FAKES Accountability Act] (H.R. 2395; 2021-2022 Session) and “No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications Act of 2024” [NO AI FRAUD Act] (H.R. 6943; 2023-2024 Session) in the House of Representatives, as well as the “Nurture Originals, Foster Art, and Keep Entertainment Safe” Act of 2023 [NO FAKES Act] (discussion draft) in the Senate, to place more regulation on this increasing – and deceptive – advertising practice. Even a standard advertising practice – product placement – is getting the AI-treatment. Advertising companies like Rembrand are developing software platforms that utilize generative AI to insert virtual products into videos and photographs post-production. This technology permits advertisers to partner with content creators and include sponsorships in advertising that cannot be skipped or ignored given its integration into the content. It also raises a host of truth-in-advertising questions. And, of course, just as the legal market has recently seen lawyers relying upon case law that was wholly invented by AI (without checking the citations), advertisers proceed at their own risk if they publicize advertising claims generated by AI that may not have the requisite substantiation or grounding in data, exposing the advertiser to potentially significant false advertising liability. As AI advertising continues to take root, companies can expect increased regulation, litigation, and policy in this space. Advertisers must stay informed of these trends and should apply the principles of transparency, accuracy, and human oversight that guide the use of AI more broadly.

,,Le Creuset giveaway scam: Taylor Swift deepfakes everywhere,"Please enable JavaScript    Deception in the digital age has taken a sophisticated turn with the emergence of the Le Creuset giveaway scam. Exploiting advanced deepfake technology, this elaborate scheme impersonates global icons Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, luring unsuspecting individuals with the false promise of a Le Creuset cookware giveaway. This exploration delves into the intricacies of the scam, revealing the tactics employed by scammers to exploit the trust associated with celebrity endorsements and renowned brands. As we navigate through the shadows of deepfake deception, the Le Creuset giveaway scam raises pressing questions about the security of personal information and challenges our very understanding of reality in the age of seamless technological replication. No, the Le Creuset giveaway scam is a deceptive scheme that utilizes deepfake technology to impersonate celebrities and promote a fictitious giveaway of high-end cookware from the renowned brand Le Creuset. In this particular scam, Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez are targeted, with their images and voices manipulated through artificial intelligence to create convincing videos endorsing the fraudulent promotion. The scammers distribute these deepfake videos on popular social media platforms, including Meta-owned platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, as well as TikTok. In these videos, the deepfaked Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez express excitement about giving away free Le Creuset sets. The scammers employ sophisticated techniques to imitate not only the appearance of the celebrities but also their voices, making the deception more convincing. To add an additional layer of credibility to the Le Creuset giveaway scam, the perpetrators create fake advertisements resembling legitimate news outlets, including one that appears to be from the Food Network. These ads contain links that direct users to websites claiming to facilitate the giveaway. The scammers inform users that they can obtain the supposedly “free” Le Creuset items by paying a nominal one-time “small shipping fee of $9.96.” However, the reality is far from what the users expect. Those who fall for the scam and provide their personal information in an attempt to claim the free cookware find themselves entangled in a subscription trap. Instead of receiving the promised Le Creuset items, users end up subscribed to a monthly charge of $89.95, in addition to the initial “shipping” fee. The Le Creuset giveaway scam exploits the trust and excitement associated with celebrity endorsements to trick unsuspecting users into divulging personal information and subscribing to unauthorized services. It highlights the evolving challenges posed by deepfake technology in the digital age and underscores the importance of user vigilance and skepticism to avoid falling victim to such deceptive practices. Platforms, including Meta and TikTok, are actively working to combat these scams, but the complexity of deepfake technology poses an ongoing challenge for detection and prevention.

,,Student tracking Taylor Swift’s jet pushes back on threatened legal action: ‘Look what you made me do’,"CIProud.com      by: Miranda Nazzaro, The Hill, Addy Bink Posted: Feb 21, 2024 / 10:47 AM CST Updated: Feb 21, 2024 / 10:47 AM CST    (The Hill) — The attorney for a college student who has tracked singer Taylor Swift’s jet pushed back at the superstar’s threat of legal action, arguing there is “nothing unlawful” about his client’s actions.  The letter, on behalf of University of Central Florida student Jack Sweeney, comes in response to multiple requests by Swift’s attorneys that demanded Sweeney stop tracking and sharing the flight information of the global superstar online.  For several years, Sweeney has maintained social media accounts that track the takeoffs and landings of planes owned by high-profile figures, including politicians, celebrities and billionaires. Sweeney uses public data from the Federal Aviation Administration and often notes the carbon emissions from each flight.  Swift’s legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to Sweeney in December, arguing the singer would “have no choice but to pursue any and all legal remedies” if he did not stop the “stalking and harassing behavior.” A spokesperson for Swift previously told Nexstar that “the timing of stalkers suggests a connection” to the flight tracking account. “[Sweeney’s] posts tell you exactly when and where she would be,” they explained. Sweeney on Monday posted his legal team’s Jan. 25 response on X, formerly Twitter, with the text “Look What You Made Me Do,” a nod to one of Swift’s hit songs.  Sweeney’s attorney, James Slater, noted his client and his client’s company — GRNDCTRL, LLC — are using publicly accessible information to track the jets. He argued that Sweeney’s social media account (@taylorswiftjets on Instagram) was “engaged in protected speech” that does not violate Swift’s rights.  “Your letter’s tone of alarm is unfounded,” Slater wrote in the letter. “Our clients’ website only provides the location of private jets using publicly available information. That information poses no threat to Ms. Swift’s safety.”  Slater maintained Sweeney has not made any credible threats against the singer, pushing back on Swift’s attorney’s stalking claim. He added later he “doubts” Swift will pursue legal action, but vowed to defend Sweeney’s rights should she do so.  Swift’s attorneys and Sweeney did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.  In a statement previously shared with Nexstar, Sweeney defended his tracking accounts and explained that if Swift’s team is concerned about her privacy and safety, they should register the plane to a trust rather than an LLC, “especially when the LLC is the initials to the names in your family.” Additionally, Sweeney called out the tail number on Swift’s plane, N898TS, which contains Swift’s initials and her birthday, 1989. “When the Embassy of Japan in the USA expresses confidence that Swift can make a flight from Tokyo to the Super Bowl, it indicates public interest,” he noted. “Therefore, one should reasonably expect that their jet will be tracked, whether or not I’m the one doing it, as it is public information after all.” The “All Too Well” singer has faced scrutiny over her use of private jets and the resulting carbon emissions. Sweeney’s accounts were referenced in a 2022 study that found Swift to be one of the biggest celebrity carbon dioxide polluters. Swift is currently on the 2024 leg of her “Eras,” tour that includes nearly 150 shows around the globe. It kicked off on March 17, 2023, and runs through early December 2024. She is next expected to perform four shows in Sydney, Australia, this weekend before making her way to Singapore next week.  Sweeney told a Florida news outlet earlier this month his accounts used to track Swift’s jet on Instagram, Facebook, and X were taken down hours after he received the cease-and-desist letter from the singer’s legal team, but not by him. The Instagram and Facebook accounts remained down as of Wednesday. The Hill reached out to X and Meta for further comment.   Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.
