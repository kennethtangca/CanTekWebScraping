,,Oprah Warns People That Her Name Is Being Used Without Permission to Sell Weight Loss Gummies,"“Please don’t be taken advantage of, and don’t give your personal information to them,” Oprah says. Our editors handpick the products that we feature. We may earn commission from the links on this page. Over the weekend, Oprah shared a short video on Instagram setting the record straight about fraudulent ads that feature her endorsement of weight loss gummies. “And so it happened to me again today,” Oprah told her 21.6 million followers in the clip. “A woman came up to me and said, ‘Can you help me get your weight loss gummies?’ And I said, ‘Ma’am, I don’t have anything to do with weight loss gummies. And let me just tell you, you’re the fifth person this week to mention it, so I’m going to address it.’” She continued, “There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out, and I want you to hear it straight from me that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of, and don’t give your personal information to them.” Back in 2015, Oprah made headlines when she partnered with WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) and has always been candid about her own weight loss journey. But gummies that claim to shed unwanted pounds are not part of her journey—despite the fact that some companies falsely advertise these products using Oprah’s name and image. In a statement to Oprah Daily, a spokesperson for Oprah said: “There is a company placing fraudulent ads claiming Oprah Winfrey is selling weight loss gummies, using a variety of methods including websites, texts, emails, and social media posts targeting consumers. These ads are false, Oprah Winfrey does not have anything to do with these products. We are working to have the fraudulent use of her name and image stopped.” Watch Oprah’s Instagram message above to hear her important message–and if you come across any of these ads, remember: They are fraudulent!

,,Oprah Winfrey wants fans to know that she doesn’t endorse weight loss gummies or pills,"Oprah Winfrey is warning fans against falling victim to companies selling weight loss products using her name and image. On Sunday, the 68-year-old former talk show host and media mogul took to Instagram to distance herself from gummies being sold online, saying she does not endorse edible weight loss products. In the short video, Winfrey said she felt compelled to address the online scams after being approached five times in one week by people looking for weight loss gummies. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills and I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name,” she told her 21.6 million Instagram followers. Winfrey, who does have a partnership with and stake in WW International, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers, added in the video caption: “Fraud alert! Please don’t buy any weight loss gummies with my picture or name on them. “There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out and I want you to hear it straight from me, that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of and don’t give your personal information to them.” CNN has contacted Winfrey’s representatives for further comment. Earlier this year, a series of sponsored videos began circulating online using Winfrey’s name and likeness to promote a product. One ad posted on Facebook on April 27 urged users to “Claim your fitness gummies from Oprah until the 30th,” with a promise that the product would induce considerable weight loss within three weeks. What's the magic number of steps to keep weight off? Here's what a new study says In May, Winfrey addressed the scams via her representative. “These ads are a complete fabrication,” Nicole Nichols told USA Today. “Oprah has nothing to do with this gummy product and does not endorse any such diet or weight-loss pill.” Winfrey has publicly shared her weight loss journey for years and famously declared “I love bread” in a Weight Watchers commercial back in 2016.

,,"Oprah Isn't Selling Weight-Loss Gummies, Regardless of the Ads You May Have Seen","And she really, really doesn't want you to fall for those fake ads.  Oprah Winfrey is no stranger to endorsing products she thinks her fans will fall in love with—after all, her new slate of ""Favorite Things"" just arrived in time for holiday shopping. But disreputable companies have been known to fake Oprah's seal of approval, and she's setting the record straight on one nefarious example. The media mogul took to Instagram on Monday to call out weight loss supplement brands for trying to attach her image and endorsement to their products in online ads and targeted email campaigns. Winfrey says she knew she had to come out and say something after five people approached her about the gummies over the course of a week. ""So it happened to me again today,"" Oprah explains in the brief video. ""A woman came up to me and said, 'Can you help me get your weight loss gummies?' And I said, 'Ma'am, I don't have anything to do with weight loss gummies, and let me just tell you, you're the fifth person this week to mention it.' So I'm going to address it."" Online fact-checkers—from Snopes to USA Today—have debunked the advertisements in the past. To be clear, Oprah isn't hawking a line of CBD with Whoopi Goldberg, nor is she involved with keto gummies from Weight Watchers. A spokesperson from Oprah's team denied her endorsement of a diet pill to Politifact back in March. But that doesn't seem to stop scammers from spreading those lies on social media. ""It's come to my attention many times over,"" Oprah went on to say in her Instagram post. ""Somebody's out there misusing my name, even sending emails to people advertising weight loss gummies. I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills, and I don't want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name. So please know: I have no weight loss gummies."" It makes sense that advertisers would want to tie Winfrey, who has been open about her health goals and journey in the past, to some kind of quick fix for weight loss. But while we might not always agree with Oprah's takes on health and wellness, her suggestions haven't typically leaned into diet pill territory—back in the days of Fen-Phen and Redux, Oprah was championing a more food- and fitness-based weight loss philosophy. Articles on her website still recommend a lifestyle of healthy eating and movement, only turning to supplements or pills in consultation with a doctor. We at EatingWell would definitely have to agree—most over-the-counter supplements go unregulated, and the only way to judge their safety is by checking out the Department of Defense's Operation Supplement Safety Scorecard. Even if you find a safe supplement that piques your interest, there's a good chance the supplement will be ineffective or result in unsustainable weight loss, as EatingWell Nutrition Editor Jessica Ball, M.S., RD, has pointed out. If you're really eager to lose weight, there are much healthier (and more sustainable) tips you can follow. For instance, transitioning to a customizable and varied eating pattern like the Mediterranean diet, which is chock-full of healthy proteins, fats and carbs, can help you balance your plate without feeling bored or stifled by eating the same dishes on repeat. Finding a kind of exercise you enjoy—whether it's kickboxing, taking a walk or dancing around the kitchen—can also be key to helping you feel your best. You'd also do well to remember that weight loss isn't as important as your health, and the two things might not always go hand-in-hand. Unless a doctor has told you differently, your top priority should be your overall health, which you can take care of by eating a wide variety of foods, getting some exercise, sleeping and making time for your mental health. An internet gummy is no match for sustainable choices that support your wellbeing.

In a 2015 campaign for WW International, the TV personality opened up about her weight loss journey. “Anybody who struggles with their weight — and I’m at the head of that class — knows it’s not just about the weight; it’s about something bigger,” she said at the time.

,,Oprah Winfrey Weight Loss Gummies Facebook Ads Are a Scam,"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is continuing to host at least dozens of different scam ads on the two social media platforms that claim there are ""career-ending allegations"" against Oprah Winfrey. Those ads lead to fake articles that were designed to fool users into thinking they're reading from a well-known news website. The articles say that Winfrey endorsed so-called ""weight loss gummies,"" usually mentioning either CBD gummies or keto gummies. However, there were no allegations against Winfrey. That part was clickbait. Further, Winfrey never endorsed any weight loss diet supplements or gummies of the CBD or keto variety. In the past, we published two different reports about this subject. The first one was presented on this website on Dec. 15, 2021, and debunked the rumor that Winfrey had endorsed CBD oil and CBD gummies. The second report was from May 12, 2022, and debunked the claim about Winfrey and keto gummies. More than one year after our first story was published, Meta is still accepting money from unknown advertisers who are using Winfrey's image and likeness without permission in order to push ""weight loss gummy"" scams, either about CBD or keto, to users. In fact, in order to push the scam to even more users, scammers are using one of Winfrey's own Instagram videos where she put out her own ""fraud alert"" about the ""weight loss gummies"" falsehood.   In the video's caption, Winfrey wrote, ""Fraud alert! Please don't buy any weight loss gummies with my picture or name on them. There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out and I want you to hear it straight from me, that I have nothing to do with them. Please don't be taken advantage of and don't give your personal information to them."" During the video, here's what Winfrey had to say about the ""weight loss gummies"" scam: And so, it happened to me again today. A woman came up to me and said, ""Can you help me get your weight loss gummies?"" And I said, ""Ma'am, I don't have anything to do with weight loss gummies, and let me just tell you, you're the fifth person this week to mention it."" So I'm going to address it. So this is my attempt to address it. It's come to my attention, many times over, somebody's out there misusing my name, even sending emails to people, advertising weight loss gummies. I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills and I don't want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name. So please know I have no weight loss gummies.  In the Instagram video, Winfrey's final and slowly pronounced mention of the three words ""weight loss gummies"" was trimmed out by scammers and used in new video ads, as if Winfrey had made the video to endorse the products. In other words, Meta, which hosted Winfrey's original Instagram video, was allowing scammers to repackage her words into a misleading clip, for which Meta then accepted money to be run as paid ads, and continues to do so today.

is taking legal action against a company that has been using her name to sell several weight loss products.  

The suit was filed on Wednesday by Harpo Inc., which is the production company founded by Winfrey. Harpo Inc. is also the owner of the Oprah brand. The complaint was field to the US District Court for the Central District of California. Get info without
leaving the page. The suit accuses Emblaze One, Limitless X Inc., and other brands of selling and promoting Oprah Winfrey Keto Gummies and Oprah Winfrey CBD Gummies online across multiple websites. In her lawsuit, Winfrey said the company has misled her fans into thinking she is connected to the wight loss products. Winfrey is also requesting that the company be prohibited from using her name. And she’s asking that all profits from sales of the items attached to her name be given to her.

“When consumers see advertisements like this one, the only logical conclusion is that Ms. Winfrey and/or her company signed off on the use of ‘Oprah Keto Pills’ and the pills do in fact work,” the suit read. Winfrey’s attorney also spoke about the issue. “The unlawful actions of Defendants amount to a willful and conscious disregard for [Oprah’s] rights and are intentionally designed to capitalize on the goodwill, celebrity and/or fame associated with Ms. Winfrey and/or the OPRAH brand,” the attorney added. Winfrey spoke out about the weight loss pills back in 2022, telling her fans in an Instagram video that she doesn’t endorse any edible weight loss products. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills and I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name,” she said in the video. “There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out and I want you to hear it straight from me, that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of and don’t give your personal information to them.” The post Oprah Sues Weight Loss Company for Using Her Name to Sell Gummy Products appeared first on 21Ninety.

,,Oprah Winfrey Warns Fans About Weight Loss Gummies ‘Misusing’ Her Name," “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills.”  We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. Why Trust Us? Whenever Oprah Winfrey drops her favorite things, we add them to our carts ASAP. Whether it’s her favorite Carroll Kelsey crossbody bag, the perfect pants, her go-to intimate wash from Barbara Sturm, or her favorite sneakers, the 68-year-old proudly gets behind products she uses and loves. But in a recent Instagram video, the talk show host spoke up about certain weight loss gummies that claim to have her coveted endorsement when they do not. Winfrey took to her Instagram account over the weekend to expose the supplement company that has been using her image and name in an attempt to sell the supplements—without her permission. In the video, Winfrey spoke directly into the camera to explain the situation to her followers. “A woman came up to me and said, ‘can you help me get your weight loss gummies?’ And I said, ‘Ma’am, I don’t have anything to do with weight loss gummies. And let me just tell you, you’re the fifth person this week to mention it, so I’m going to address it,’” Winfrey said into the camera. She continued, “So this is my attempt to address it. It’s come to my attention many times over, somebody is out there, misusing my name, even sending emails to people advertising weight loss gummies. I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills. And I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name. So please know I have no weight loss gummies.” And it’s more than just clearing her name that Winfrey is concerned about. The talk show host warned followers in the caption to beware of giving out their personal information to the fraudulent supplement company. “Fraud alert! Please don’t buy any weight loss gummies with my picture or name on them,” she captioned the video. “There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out, and I want you to hear it straight from me that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of and don’t give your personal information to them.” Winfrey has previously credited her weight loss to the lifestyle changes she made following WW. Before dropping 42 lbs. on the program, she was pre-diabetic and dealt with blood pressure issues. But why are diet pills and gummies something Winfrey wants nothing to do with? Weight loss pills and gummies that say they help shed pounds don’t have a ton of research to back up these claims—and there’s very little regulation of supplements by the FDA. “There is absolutely no conclusive scientific evidence to support the use of weight loss gummies to promote weight loss,” says adds Keri Gans, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition consultant and author of The Small Change Diet. “Unfortunately, these types of supplements are not regulated the same by the FDA as they do with drugs, and therefore the potential for harm is greater.” So we can totally see why Winfrey took to Instagram to address the issue with her fans directly. As Oprah warns, stay vigilant and be weary of claims. We’ll keep shopping Winfrey’s real favorites in the meantime!

,,Fact check: Ads claiming to sell Oprah Winfrey weight-loss gummies are scams,"A series of sponsored videos circulating widely on Facebook use the name and likeness of Oprah Winfrey to push a familiar clickbait trope, claiming a celebrity-backed product – in this case, weight-loss gummies – can spur significant weight loss. ""Grab Your Fitness-Gummy From Oprah!"" says the caption of one Facebook advertisement that has been viewed more than 120,000 times since April 27. ""Just three weeks in, and she already melted off 100!""  Other videos with tens of thousands of views make similar claims, interspersing footage of Winfrey and other celebrity figures with shots of brightly-colored gummy bears. The Facebook advertisements link to outside websites where users can purchase the gummies. One post links to a site featuring a story supposedly from TIME Magazine that says Oprah launched the ""weight loss miracle gummy"" product in partnership with Weight Watchers. But there's no such article and no such endorsement. These videos promote a scam, a spokesperson for Winfrey told USA TODAY. ""These ads are a complete fabrication,"" Nicole Nichols, a senior vice president of communications for Winfrey, wrote in an email. ""Oprah has nothing to do with this gummy product and does not endorse any such diet or weight-loss pill."" USA TODAY reached out to several pages behind the advertisements for comment. Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks While Winfrey does have a partnership with and stake in WW International, the company formerly known as Weight Watchers, USA TODAY could not find any evidence that Winfrey sponsors or sells weight-loss gummy products. Nichols told USA TODAY the star has never sold weight-loss supplements in the past and does not plan to sell them in the future. She also said the footage used in the ads was not authorized by Winfrey. Nonetheless, videos spreading the false claim have been circulating since at least February 2022, according to reporting from Politifact and Lead Stories. It's unclear whether the pages posting the ads are associated with each other. Previously, USA TODAY has identified several Facebook advertisements that falsely claimed celebrities sponsored their products, including videos claiming Shark Tank judges had endorsed a keto diet pill and others claiming the Pioneer Woman had endorsed CBD gummies that would ""reverse diabetes.""

,,Oprah sets the record straight on weight loss gummies,"   Stop hitting Oprah Winfrey up for her weight loss gummies — because they don’t exist. A frustrated Winfrey took to Instagram Sunday to set the record straight about slimming products bearing her name and image. “And so it happened to me again today.

But that hasn’t stopped her followers from falling victim to advertising that’s falsely using her name to sell weight loss gummies, and the confusion has gotten so bad that Winfrey decided she needed to clear the air with a public message. “It happened to me again today: A woman came up to me and said, ‘Can you help me get your weight loss gummies?'” Oprah recounted on her Instagram page. “I said, ‘Ma’am, I don’t have anything to do with weight loss gummies. And let me tell you, you’re the fifth person this week to mention it.'” Oprah explained that the many similar interactions she’d had lately have led her to realize someone out there is using her name in association with this product without her permission, even sending emails to customers who are being misled. But she assured everyone that the connection is totally fictitious. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills, and I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name,” she said. “So please know: I have no weight loss gummies.” And while there are, of course, many celebrities who make money by lending their likeness to dubious dieting solutions, it’s unfortunately becoming more and more common that these relationships are faked. In fact, that includes our very own Katie Couric, who commented on Oprah’s post: “Happened to me too. So frustrating.” One might understand, however, why some fans would believe that Oprah could be associated with a weight loss product like this. She brought viewers along on her own weight loss journey over the 25 years of The Oprah Winfrey Show, including the time in 1988 when she wheeled 67 pounds of fat on stage to illustrate how much she’d lost. (She later came to regret that stunt, which she called “one of the biggest ego trips of my life.”) She’s also been featured in advertisements for Weight Watchers, and she bought a 10 percent stake in the company back in 2015. Now we can all rest assured that gummies are not part of her dietary repertoire, but if you’re looking for a recommendation that is certifiably O-mazing, tried her deviled eggs recipe.

,,Oprah Winfrey calls out weight loss gummies using her name and image: ‘Fraud alert!’," The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Online scams are using the television personality’s name and image to sell weight loss gummies  Oprah Winfrey surprised by Prince Harry’s dedication to The Me You Can’t See Oprah Winfrey has warned fans not to purchase weight loss products using her name and image. On Sunday, the 68-year-old media mogul took to Instagram to set the record straight about weight loss gummies claiming to be endorsed by her. In a short video, the former talk show host cautioned her followers not to fall for online scams using her likeness in its advertising. “And so it happened to me again today,” she began the video. “A woman came up to me and said, ‘Can you help me get your weight loss gummies?’ And I said, ‘Ma’am, I don’t have anything to do with weight loss gummies.’” Winfrey said that she was compelled to address the weight loss scam after she was approached about the gummies five times in one week. “Somebody’s out there misusing my name, even sending emails to people advertising weight loss gummies,” she added. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills and I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name. So please know, I have no weight loss gummies,” Winfrey stressed. The author also captioned her video with a warning to her followers explaining that she hasn’t endorsed any weight loss supplement being advertised online. “Fraud alert!” she wrote. “Please don’t buy any weight loss gummies with my picture or name on them. There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out and I want you to hear it straight from me, that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of and don’t give your personal information to them.” This is not the first time Winfrey has needed to address weight loss gummies using her name and likeness to sell products. Earlier this year, Winfrey’s senior vice president of communications Nicole Nichols emphasised that Winfrey is not associated with weight loss gummies being sold online. ""These ads are a complete fabrication,"" Nichols told USA Today last May. “Oprah has nothing to do with this gummy product and does not endorse any such diet or weight-loss pill.” Several advertisements for weight loss gummies have recently circulated on Facebook. The advertisements – which have been labeled as “False information” by Facebook – intersperse footage of Winfrey throughout the ad. Another advertisement reads, “Grab Your Fitness-Gummy From Oprah!"". The videos are linked to outside websites where people can purchase the weight loss gummies. One advertisement links to a headline appearing to be from Time magazine, which reads: “Oprah Launches Breakthrough ‘Weight Loss Miracle Gummy’ in Partnership with Weight Watchers After Being Forced to Lose 60 LBS in Just Weeks”. While Oprah Winfrey has emphasised that she has not endorsed any type of weight loss gummy or diet pill, the philanthropist does have a partnership with and stake in WW International, formally known as Weight Watchers. Winfrey became a sponsor for WW after she personally used the company’s weight loss programme.

,,Oprah Winfrey Gets Real About ‘Weight Loss Gummies’ and ‘Diet Pills’ in New Video," ""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Oprah Winfrey warns fans against weight loss gummies that use her name or image on marketing materials. Winfrey revealed in an Instagram video that she does not endorse weight loss gummies and that the brand is using her name and image without permission. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills. And I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name,” Winfrey said. Whenever Oprah Winfrey drops her favorite things, we add them to our carts ASAP. Whether it’s her favorite Carroll Kelsey crossbody bag, the perfect pants, her go-to intimate wash from Barbara Sturm, or her favorite sneakers, the 68-year-old proudly gets behind products she uses and loves. But in a recent Instagram video, the talk show host spoke up about certain weight loss gummies that claim to have her coveted endorsement when they do not. Winfrey took to her Instagram account over the weekend to expose the supplement company that has been using her image and name in an attempt to sell the supplements—without her permission. In the video, Winfrey spoke directly into the camera to explain the situation to her followers. “A woman came up to me and said, ‘can you help me get your weight loss gummies?’ And I said, ‘Ma’am, I don’t have anything to do with weight loss gummies. And let me just tell you, you’re the fifth person this week to mention it, so I’m going to address it,’” Winfrey said into the camera. She continued, “So this is my attempt to address it. It’s come to my attention many times over, somebody is out there, misusing my name, even sending emails to people advertising weight loss gummies. I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills. And I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name. So please know I have no weight loss gummies.” And it’s more than just clearing her name that Winfrey is concerned about. The talk show host warned followers in the caption to beware of giving out their personal information to the fraudulent supplement company. “Fraud alert! Please don’t buy any weight loss gummies with my picture or name on them,” she captioned the video. “There have been social media ads, emails, and fake websites going out, and I want you to hear it straight from me that I have nothing to do with them. Please don’t be taken advantage of and don’t give your personal information to them.” Winfrey has previously credited her weight loss to the lifestyle changes she made following WW. Before dropping 42 lbs. on the program, she was pre-diabetic and dealt with blood pressure issues. But why are diet pills and gummies something Winfrey wants nothing to do with? Weight loss pills and gummies that say they help shed pounds don’t have a ton of research to back up these claims—and there’s very little regulation of supplements by the FDA. “There is absolutely no conclusive scientific evidence to support the use of weight loss gummies to promote weight loss,” says adds Keri Gans, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition consultant and author of The Small Change Diet. “Unfortunately, these types of supplements are not regulated the same by the FDA as they do with drugs, and therefore the potential for harm is greater.” So we can totally see why Winfrey took to Instagram to address the issue with her fans directly. As Oprah warns, stay vigilant and be weary of claims. We’ll keep shopping Winfrey’s real favorites in the meantime!

,,"No, Oprah isn’t selling or endorsing weight loss gummies","      For months, ads on social media have claimed celebrity Oprah Winfrey is selling and/or endorsing a line of weight loss gummies. Some even include video of Oprah talking about weight loss gummies, while others use shocking news headlines as part of their ad. That’s led several VERIFY readers to text us with questions asking if these products are real. One said they received a text from an “0prahsgiveaway” website about keto gummies allegedly sold by Oprah and WeightWatchers. Another sent a screenshot of an ad urging the reader to claim a free bottle of the gummies. Is Oprah selling or endorsing weight loss gummies? No, Oprah is not selling or endorsing weight loss gummies. Did you know VERIFY has a YouTube show? Subscribe for a weekly roundup of our top fact-checks. Oprah denied selling or endorsing any weight loss gummies in an October 2022 Instagram video. The gummies are instead a version of a common scam that uses “miracle” health and cosmetic products to take your credit card information and surprise you with charges. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills, and I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name,” Oprah said in the video after explaining she was addressing the issue because she kept getting questions about it. “So please know I have no weight loss gummies.” Ironically, scammers have edited that clip into more misleading ads.   Some gummy sellers have since used out-of-context clips from Oprah’s warnings within their ads. In this ad’s video, for example, there are two different clips pulling from parts of the video where she said “weight loss gummies.” Oprah Daily, the digital publication Oprah owns, also wrote an article denying Oprah’s involvement with weight loss gummies. “Back in 2015, Oprah made headlines when she partnered with WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) and has always been candid about her own weight loss journey,” wrote Oprah Daily. “But gummies that claim to shed unwanted pounds are not part of her journey—despite the fact that some companies falsely advertise these products using Oprah’s name and image.” The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a warning about scams like this on Feb. 17, 2023. The FTC says to approach celebrity testimonials with caution, search for the product online alongside words like “scam” and “complaints” and remember that the government doesn’t review or evaluate supplements. Also in February, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned of tainted weight loss products promoted as miracle cures. Some of these products are relabeled prescription drugs for unrelated ailments such as blood pressure and seizures, while others might have dangerous ingredients, the FDA said. Neither the FTC or FDA singled out the Oprah keto pills, but that’s because scams like this take on countless different forms. There are many variations of the specific ads used in this scam, but here’s a general overview of what to watch out for.  How does this scam work? Many of these celebrity-backed miracle cure ads will wind up taking you to a phony news article. VERIFY found such a fake article while researching the fake Mayim Bialik CBD gummies in 2022. The Oprah weight loss gummies ad also take their victims to a fake news article, in this case one that looks like a convincing mockup of the Time magazine website. More from VERIFY: No, Mayim Bialik is not endorsing CBD gummies You can tell the website is a fake because the URL doesn’t match up with the real website. In the archived Time article, the website URL was “brownketoclub.us” which is now defunct. These web pages normally don’t last long before they’re taken down, and so the scammers regularly have to move on to new URLs. VERIFY searched the real Time website for “oprah weight loss gummy,” and found that no such article exists. The “article” itself reads more like an ad than an actual news story. This is consistent for these kinds of ads, regardless of what the headline says.  If you click on any of the links within the articles, it will take you to a page that typically uses urgent and sensational language in an attempt to bait you into sharing your information. You can see archived examples for the link in the fake Time article here and another article’s links here. While the pages aren’t exactly the same, they use identical tactics. They promise a free bottle if you give them your information, and try to pressure you into making a hasty decision by claiming the time you have to get one is extremely limited. They also make sensational claims about the product’s effectiveness, and try to establish trust with apparent customer reviews. Neither store page makes a reference to Oprah, despite her name being used in the ads. If you do try to “RUSH YOUR ORDER” like the store page wants you to do, you’ll usually find it also asks for your credit card information even though it advertises an opportunity to get a free bottle. Whether you actually get a bottle or not, you will typically be charged more than you agreed to. Better Business Bureau (BBB) complaints for countless keto weight loss gummy companies, including some that reference Oprah, describe the same kind of scam. The customer pays for a bottle or expects a free bottle, and they are charged for far more than they’ve purchased and sometimes unknowingly sign up for a costly subscription. If the customer tries to cancel their order or get a refund for any reason, the gummy sellers allegedly make it difficult and sometimes impossible to get a refund, and often only give customers a partial refund if at all. There are many scams promoting a variety of products that follow this formula. For example, the customer question and answer section on this anti-aging cream’s Amazon page shows that the product was supposedly endorsed by Jennifer Aniston, Betty White, Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Lopez, and people reported being charged hundreds of dollars for a surprise subscription. Another skin cream’s BBB page is full of identical complaints. The VERIFY team works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

,,," Part of the McClatchy Media Network Wednesday, February 21, 2024 Today's eEdition No, Oprah Winfrey isn’t peddling weight loss gummies. The media mogul took to social media to set the record straight about fraudsters using her celebrity to sell weight loss supplements. In a video shared to her more than 21.5 million Instagram followers, Winfrey warned against “social media ads, emails, and fake websites” using her name and likeness to push the supplements onto unsuspecting consumers. It’s not clear who is advertising the product — or if there’s a real product at all. The award-winning journalist and talk show host sounded the alarm after she said at least five people reached out to ask how they could get their hands on the supposed gummies. “It’s coming to my attention, many times over. Somebody’s out there misusing my name,” she said. “I have nothing to do with weight loss gummies or diet pills. And I don’t want you all taken advantage of by people misusing my name.” Consumer watchdogs say it’s not uncommon for fraudsters to use fake celebrity endorsements to trick consumers into buying products and services. In 2016, the Federal Trade Commission sued a Florida-based marketer accused of sending spam emails and using phony endorsements to peddle “unproven dietary products.” “The sites also falsely represented that the products for sale had been featured or endorsed by Oprah Winfrey or the hosts of the television show ‘The Doctors,” the commission said. “These fake news websites then linked to other sites where consumers could purchase the defendants’ weight-loss products.” It’s not clear if any consumers have been impacted by the latest scam touting Oprah Winfrey’s name, or if the media mogul plans to take legal action.

,,How Oprah lost those 40 pounds,"  Oprah Winfrey revealed this week that she lost more than 40 pounds, and she did it using one of the most popular weight loss programs out there: Weight Watchers. In a story first published on People magazine’s web site, Oprah said she’s still eating the tacos and pasta that she loves, and she doesn’t feel deprived following the Weight Watchers system. Earlier, she told People that she’s exercising more, striving to take at least 10,000 steps a day. “Weight Watchers is easier than any other program I’ve ever been on. It’s a lifestyle, a way of eating and a way of living that’s so freeing. You never feel like you are on a diet and it works,” Oprah, 62, said in a release about a new Weight Watchers’ ad campaign. Weight Watchers works by using a point system for people to track calories. Although it dominated for decades, it recently faced challenges from Nutrisystem and free apps and sites designed to track health and weight loss. The company’s chief executive stepped down earlier this year. Still, the company saw a bump earlier when Oprah purchased a stake in the company – she’s the third largest shareholder in Weight Watchers, and has a stake worth about $77 million – and as she continued to share her weight loss successes. After the announcement this week of Oprah’s weight loss milestone and the company’s new ad campaign, Weight Watchers shares jumped 17%. Although the program has evolved in recent years, there’s a reason its point system and group meetings have stuck around. “It’s livable,” said Dr. Melina Jampolis, a physician-nutrition specialist, who is not in any way affiliated with Weight Watchers said in 2015. “With restaurants and holidays and parties, you have the tools to handle any eating occasion.” Weight Watchers has been a powerful and effective tool in the fight against obesity since the program was founded in 1963 by Jean Nidetch, a self-described “overweight housewife obsessed with cookies.” After struggling to lose weight for years, Nidetch began hosting weekly meetings at her home with friends, to discuss their difficulties with dieting and exercise. “Compulsive eating is an emotional problem,” Nidetch told Time magazine in 1972, “and we use an emotional approach to its solution.” Abiding by her philosophy – “It’s choice, not chance, that determines your destiny” – Nidetch managed to lose more than 70 pounds, and keep it off. According to its latest earnings release, Weight Watchers currently has 2.8 million active subscribers worldwide, down from 3.4 million one year ago. Weight Watchers works by using what it calls “SmartPoints,” where one number represents each food and drink’s calories, saturated fat, sugar and protein. For stress, superfoods are better than comfort foods When US News and World Report ranked 35 of the most popular diets, Weight Watchers tied for fourth place overall – and No. 1 for weight loss. (The diets taking the No. 1 and No. 2 spots overall were the DASH diet, MIND diet and TLC diet.) U.S. News called Weight Watchers “effective,” highlighting the upside that you can eat what you want and that no foods are off-limits. Downsides include the program’s price and tedious point tallying. “It’s based in real life, real food, real living,” Gary Foster, Weight Watchers’ chief scientific officer said last year. “We’re not a brand about exclusion, saying ‘you must eat this’ and ‘you can’t eat that.’ You’re in charge of what’s in and what’s out.” If you restrict eating to certain foods or certain times of the day, said Foster, you might get people to eat less, but the results are short lived. They’ll put the weight right back on. Cut this food and extend your life “Broadly, reality not meeting expectations is what trips people up,” said Foster. “The most common example is when people have unrealistic notions of what the weight loss journey will be – that they’ll lose the same amount (of weight) every single week, or eat perfectly every single day. Life gets in the way. Teaching people a different mindset around that and being aware of your thinking style is key. ‘All or none’ is not good for weight, relationships or work performance.” “The other thing is to not be so myopically focused on the scale,” said Foster. “It’s a piece of metal that gives you a number and is fraught with disappointment. It’s not a good measure in the short term. It’s better over the long term. Non-scale victories like looking better, feeling better, fitting into a smaller jean size” are far more important milestones. On November 15, 1988, Oprah opened an episode of her show titled “Diet Dreams Come True” by revealing her new slim figure. She showed – not just told – her audience how much weight she lost by wheeling 67 pounds of fat on stage in a bright red Radio Flyer wagon. How much sugar is OK? Paper adds to debate “This has been the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life,” Winfrey said. “Those of you who are starting dieting – this is what 67 pounds of fat looks like. … It’s amazing to me that I can’t lift it, but I used to carry it around every day. When you talk about making yourself the best you can be, I’m glad I did this for my heart, because my poor heart had to send blood to all of this. It’s shocking to me.” The episode was the highest rated in the show’s history. “Her journey has been so challenging and public with weight,” said Jampolis. I think as far as celebrity endorsements go, she has the potential to be more authentic than many, because people know her struggle and because she’s not looking for a quick fix.” “Oprah has all the money in the word and she’s still had a life-long battle with her weight,” said Jampolis. “If anyone can connect with and understand the consumer, it’s her.” “In the end, weight loss isn’t what people are pursuing anymore,” said Foster. “People are no longer saying … ‘I want to lose 20 pounds.’ They say, ‘What I’m after is a healthier, happier life.’” Health effects of carbs: Where do we stand? That is to say, weight is now a metric instead of the only metric. “Dealing with choice and balance is key to long-term success,” said Jampolis. “Just focusing on food is only a small part of the equation. Psychologically, there’s more than just being at a healthy weight.” “For most people, they have a really good general sense of what they should do. Everyone knows how to do it – it’s why you don’t do it. As a nation, we’re self-medicating a lot with food.” When Weight Watchers’ partnership with Oprah was announced, Jampolis applauded the broader focus on health and happiness.   “Most weight-loss doctors and dieticians say it’s one of the strongest programs out there,” said Jampolis. “There’s a lot of positive potential. It’s a very good program that could potentially be made better with (Oprah’s) guidance.” At the end of the day, you need to feel satiated on a basic hunger level. Beyond that, you need to feel satiated on a more cerebral level, she said. It’s about letting yourself have the food, but more importantly the experiences, said Jampolis. “Happiness comes from sitting around the table with people you care about, enjoying some of your favorite dishes.” CNN’s Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this story.

,,Oprah Winfrey Reveals the Secret to Her Weight-Loss Success to Fellow Weight Watchers Members,"Here's how she lost 30 pounds. &#151; -- Oprah Winfrey has lost 30 pounds on Weight Watchers, and, in a phone call with six fellow Weight Watchers members, she revealed her secret: a weight-loss buddy. That’s right. The 62-year-old media mogul and Weight Watchers ambassador and investor said having a program partner has been crucial to her success. And her weight-loss partner is Stedman Graham, also her life partner. “He kept asking me what every point was, and I said, ‘Why don't you just join?’” she said on the call, adding, “For me, it's so much better when other people are also counting points.” “Good Morning America” listened exclusively to Winfrey’s call, where she swapped tips and shared stories with the other Weight Watchers members.  The company is launching the new “Better Together” campaign in which it is encouraging members to bring family members and friends on board. “I'm excited that other people are bringing in their friends and family members because it's been my philosophy forever, that life is better together,” Winfrey said, adding that she and Graham, 65, helped each other on the plan. “We do hold each other accountable,” she said. The other Weight Watchers members had a chance to pose questions to Winfrey. Kara and Kyle Lowry, who are sisters, said Winfrey is their inspiration. “It was unreal that we got to talk to Oprah,” Kara, 33, said. “It was fun to know and learn that she's going through the same things that we are, and just being proud of small victories,” Kyle, 30, added. The Oklahoma natives had been overweight for all their lives, and they had all but given up until they found success with Weight Watchers. After joining the plan together, the siblings lost a collective 176 pounds over the course of two years. Kara Went from a size 24 to a size 10, and Kyle went from a size 16 to a size 2. Winfrey bought a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers in October and also joined the program. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/oprah-winfrey-reveals-secret-weight-loss-success-fellow/story?id=39546929,
,,"Oprah Winfrey confirms she's on a weight-loss medication, says she's tired of 'shaming'","Winfrey said she no longer believes her weight struggles are her fault. Oprah Winfrey has confirmed she is using a medication to help her maintain her weight loss, which she said has been a work in progress for the past two years. ""I now use it as I feel I need it, as a tool to manage not yo-yoing,"" Winfrey told People magazine. ""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for."" She continued, ""I'm absolutely done with the shaming from other people, and particularly myself."" Winfrey, who will turn 70 in January, did not name the type of medication she is taking. Over the past year, use of drugs that can lead to weight loss, including Ozempic and Mounjaro, have skyrocketed in popularity. Earlier this year, weight-loss focused companies including Noom and WeightWatchers -- the latter of which Winfrey owns stock in and sits on the board -- jumped into the obesity drugs market as well. Winfrey said she lost weight steadily over the past two years with a combination of diet and exercise, but had an ""aha"" moment on medication for weight loss this past summer, when she moderated a panel on weight for her Oprah Daily outlet. During the panel discussion, doctors and experts weighed in alongside Winfrey on the antiquated theory that weight loss is all about willpower. Winfrey said during the discussion that when she first heard about the growing popularity of drugs used for weight loss, she thought of them as ""the easy way out."" Speaking to People, Winfrey said the discussion with doctors led her to change her mind. ""I had the biggest 'aha' along with many people in that audience,"" she said. ""I realized I'd been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control. Obesity is a disease. It's not about willpower -- it's about the brain."" Winfrey said she ""released my own shame about it"" and consulted with her doctor, who prescribed a medication for weight loss.  In addition to taking the medication, Winfrey emphasized that she also continues to drink plenty of water, exercise and eat well. ""I eat my last meal at 4 p.m., drink a gallon of water a day, and use the WeightWatchers principles of counting points,"" she said. ""I had an awareness of [weight-loss] medications, but felt I had to prove I had the willpower to do it. I now no longer feel that way."" Obesity is a medical condition that affects nearly 42% of people in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With obesity on the rise, drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro, both designed for people with Type 2 diabetes, have surged in popularity over the past year, as they can help people lose weight. The drugs work by helping the pancreas increase production of insulin to move sugar from the blood into body tissues. They also slow down the movement of food through the stomach and curb appetite, thereby causing weight loss. Both Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes, but some doctors prescribe the medication ""off-label"" for weight loss, as is permissible by the FDA. Wegovy, a medication that contains the same main ingredient, semaglutide, as Ozempic, is FDA-approved for weight loss. Last month, the FDA approved another drug, known as Zepbound, as a weight loss management treatment for people with obesity, or those who are overweight with at least one related underlying condition, such as high blood pressure. As a diabetes drug, it is sold under the brand name Mounjaro, as the two medications contain the same active ingredient, tirzepatide.  Clinical studies show users of the medications can lose between 5% and 20% of their body weight on the medications over time. Medical specialists point out using medication to lose weight also requires cardio and strength training and changing your diet to one that includes proteins and less processed foods with added sugars. If someone has achieved weight loss successfully and is no longer overweight or obese, there is no data that shows how safe or efficacious weight loss drugs are to maintain weight loss achieved. When these drugs are used ""off-label,"" it is usually not covered by insurance and can be costly. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/oprah-winfrey-confirms-shes-weight-loss-medication-shes/story?id=105631132,
,,Oprah Winfrey Reveals She Uses Weight-Loss Medication as a ‘Maintenance Tool': ‘I’m Absolutely Done with the Shaming’ (Exclusive),"""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift,"" Winfrey tells PEOPLE in this week's cover story  Oprah Winfrey is no stranger to scrutiny over her weight. For as long as she has been in the public eye, the icon’s body journey has played out in the media, on magazine covers and on episodes of her own eponymous hit talk show that ran for 25 seasons. ""It was public sport to make fun of me for 25 years,"" Winfrey tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story. ""I have been blamed and shamed, and I blamed and shamed myself."" One hurtful moment came early in her career, when she landed on acerbic fashion critic Mr. Blackwell’s list. ""I was on the cover of some magazine and it said, 'Dumpy, Frumpy and Downright Lumpy,' "" recalls the co-producer of the new filmThe Color Purple. (Winfrey starred in the original 1985 film.) ""I didn’t feel angry. I felt sad. I felt hurt. I swallowed the shame. I accepted that it was my fault."" No more, she says. GILBERT FLORES/VARIETY VIA GETTY IMAGES Winfrey, who turns 70 next month, is optimistic that she now has a better handle on how to maintain a healthy weight long-term and rid herself of shame once and for all. Using a holistic approach that includes regular exercise and other lifestyle tweaks, Winfrey confirms she has also added a weight-loss medication to her regimen. Weight fluctuations ""occupied five decades of space in my brain, yo-yoing and feeling like why can’t I just conquer this thing, believing willpower was my failing,"" says Winfrey, whose dogged rehabilitation after knee surgery in 2021 kick-started what has been steady weight loss over the last two years. RANDY SHROPSHIRE/VARIETY VIA GETTY ""After knee surgery, I started hiking and setting new distance goals each week. I could eventually hike three to five miles every day and a 10-mile straight-up hike on weekends,"" she says. ""I felt stronger, more fit and more alive than I’d felt in years."" Now, she says, ""I eat my last meal at 4 o’clock, drink a gallon of water a day, and use the WeightWatchers principles of counting points. I had an awareness of [weight-loss] medications, but felt I had to prove I had the willpower to do it. I now no longer feel that way."" She adds, ""I was actually recommending it to people long before I was on it myself."" The turning point for Winfrey’s approach to using pharmaceutical aids herself came in July during a taped panel conversation with weight loss experts and clinicians, called The State of Weight and part of Oprah Daily’s Life You Want series. ARTHUR MOLA/SHUTTERSTOCK  ""I had the biggest aha along with many people in that audience,"" she recalls of the discussion, which posted online in September. ""I realized I’d been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control."" She adds, ""Obesity is a disease. It’s not about willpower — it's about the brain."" Once she reconciled the science, Winfrey says she ""released my own shame about it"" and consulted her doctor, who went on to prescribe a weight-loss medication. ""I now use it as I feel I need it, as a tool to manage not yo-yoing,"" she says, opting not to name the specific drug she takes. ""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for. I’m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself."" SOUL BROTHER/SOUL B PHOTOS/SHUTTERSTOCK Winfrey is aware of the buzz around her body size, especially as the use of medications like Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro for weight loss has surged in popularity. But she stresses it has not been a magic bullet or singular solution. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. ""It’s everything,"" she says of her all-encompassing health and fitness routine. ""I know everybody thought I was on it, but I worked so damn hard. I know that if I’m not also working out and vigilant about all the other things, it doesn’t work for me."" She took the medication before Thanksgiving ""because I knew I was going to have two solid weeks of eating,"" she says, and ""instead of gaining eight pounds like I did last year, I gained half a pound . . . It quiets the food noise."" Though she’s seven pounds away from her goal weight of 160 lbs., Winfrey says ""it’s not about the number."" Instead, she’s content building on the progress she has made during the two years since her surgery. ""It was a second shot for me to live a more vital and vibrant life,"" she says. PHILLIP FARAONE/GETTY ""In Hawaii, I live on a mountain, and there’s this big hill — I used to look out the window every morning and say, 'God, one day I want to walk up that mountain.' Last year over Christmas I did it . . . It felt like redemption."" ",people.com,https://people.com/oprah-winfrey-reveals-weight-loss-medication-exclusive-8414552,
,,'Shark Tank' Keto Gummies Weight Loss Reviews Are a Scam,"About this rating ""Shark Tank"" has never endorsed or invested in any CBD or keto gummies products. If readers were scammed by this, we recommend reading this article in its entirety. We also advise readers to bookmark this article or to email it to themselves, as we plan on updating it in the future. One online scam that never seems to come to an end is the lie that the cast of the TV show ""Shark Tank"" endorsed, invested in, or provided reviews for either CBD gummies or keto gummies for weight loss. For years, scammers have used the ""Shark Tank"" name to push the false idea that the cast of the show invested in CBD gummies and keto gummies, even though no such episode of the show ever aired. No one on the ""Shark Tank"" show has anything to do with CBD gummies or keto gummies. In this story, we'll spell out everything we know about these scams. We'll also provide ways to fight back. Some readers may have seen scam ads about ""Shark Tank"" and keto gummies online, perhaps in Google search results or on Facebook or Instagram. Such ads also appeared in email messages, like the one shown below. These ads led to scammy articles branded with the logos of major publishers. However, those articles were written by scammers and hosted on scam websites. Here's how the seemingly legitimate-looking articles were created. Scammers copied the designs of various news websites in order to fool potential victims into thinking they were reading from the publisher's official page. In the past, scammers copied and used article layouts from ABC News, Fox News, Us Weekly, ""Today,"" People magazine, Time magazine, and others. The articles usually claim that various celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Ree Drummond, Kelly Clarkson, Tom Selleck, Kaley Cuoco, Melissa McCarthy, Wayne Gretzky, the cast of ""Shark Tank,"" or others all endorsed either CBD gummies or keto gummies, even though they had no involvement with the products whatsoever. In reality, the image and likeness of each celebrity was being used without permission. Aside from the scammy ads, we often see numerous fake CBD and keto gummies reviews that use the ""Shark Tank"" name. These articles aren't really reviews, however. They're paid-for product pitches that appear as sponsored content. Outlook India, Tribune India, Mid-Day.com, and others all appeared to be accepting money in exchange for sponsored content articles that named ""Shark Tank"" alongside many different CBD and keto gummies product names. In recent months, our reporters received word from some users who said they received bags (not boxes) of CBD or keto gummies products at their doorstep, despite having no recollection of ordering the products. Some also said there was no charge on their credit card. It's unclear why people who hadn't ordered or been charged for the products were receiving them in the mail. Many of these users said that the return address on the package was for a nameless ""fulfillment center"" with a P.O. box in Smyrna, Tennessee, Tampa, Florida, or Las Vegas, Nevada. Typing ""fulfillment center"" into Google (without quotes) displayed the first search suggestion as ""fulfillment center smyrna tn,"" which perhaps showed just how many people were looking for help after being scammed. Unfortunately, more details about these ""fulfillment center"" addresses were not yet available at the time this article was published. It's unclear if anyone associated with these mailboxes or locations had any knowledge of or involvement with the scams. In the past, our reporters noticed that brand new CBD gummies and keto gummies product names popped up regularly, with no sign of a parent company or any other branding, as if such details had been omitted on purpose. It's possible that many of these products were the same and had simply been rebranded after previous product names received negative feedback. We also noticed that phone numbers on some product order pages for CBD and keto gummies are often missing or disconnected. Placing a call to any working number goes to a generic, nameless customer service phone line. When calling these lines, the person on the other end of the call declined to say the name of the company they worked for, nor would they give any information regarding the name of the apparent call center. One additional aspect of the ""Shark Tank"" CBD gummies and keto gummies scams, plus the scams that used the image and likeness of other celebrities, was that many users told us they believed they would be charged around $40 for their order, but were ultimately charged close to $200. From what we could tell, this information may have appeared in the fine print of the terms and conditions, but was not mentioned at all on product checkout pages. After having difficulties getting in touch with the phone line for the product they ordered, users consistently told us that they were offered a refund of 50%, something that apparently was a part of the call center's script. In 2022, ""Shark Tank"" cast member Mark Cuban tweeted about the seemingly never-ending keto gummies scams, where he railed against tech platforms that continue to accept money from scammers to allow ads to run that promote the scams. ""Does anyone really think keto pills work?,"" Cuban asked. ""Why would anyone take an ad for them with or without the fake endorsement? Where is the content filtering that we hear so much? If a platform can't detect fake keto or CBD gummy ads, can they really detect anything? Or do they not care that mostly seniors are getting ripped off!""   The official ""Shark Tank"" website on ABC.com also once published a page about scammers that use the show's name without authorization. ""The internet has become overrun with advertisements featuring products allegedly endorsed by 'Shark Tank' or the Sharks,"" the page read. ""Many merchants are using the names and images of the show and the Sharks in an attempt to sell their products. Unfortunately, with every new episode comes the opportunity for imposters to use false information to exploit the unwary. While many products claim to have been on 'Shark Tank,' that is not always the case."" On the subject of gummy scams, this story would not be complete without the inclusion of two past court cases. In 2021, famed film actor and director Clint Eastwood won $6.1 million in a lawsuit after alleging that a Lithuanian company had used his image and likeness without permission to promote CBD products. In the following year, Eastwood won another lawsuit, also pertaining to a CBD promotion. That time, he won $2 million. Cannabis Law Report said that the lawsuit had been filed against ""Los Angeles-based Norok Innovation Inc. and its CEO Eric Popowicz."" If you believe you've been a victim of fraud, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) allows users to file a report. Also, if any readers find one of the scammy articles that claims ""Shark Tank"" or other big-name celebrities endorsed keto gummies, or find a product order page that is believed to be involved in the scam, the domain URL can be reported to its registrar. Simply visit godaddy.com/whois and type in the website address. This form will display domain registration information for the website. Look for the ""Registrar Abuse Contact Email"" and ""Registrar Abuse Contact Phone"" in order to report the website to the company that allowed it to be registered. In recent years, we've often reported about these scams involving the ""Shark Tank"" name. We will continue to bring our readers further reporting about this subject in the future. If any readers were scammed, we recommend bookmarking this page or emailing it to yourself so that you can revisit it in the future to view further updates, as we do plan on adding additional information as it becomes available.

,,Building yard employees join the fire department,"Loan.Californiaislamiccenter ""The mayor didn't tell us to do it, but we know he wants us to do it"", the manager of the building yard, wolfgang schmidt, explained the reasons why the men from the building yard underwent the training. The combination of firefighting and building yard work is already a given in many cases, schmidt continues, and will now be further strengthened by the training of the manner. The deputy commander of the fire department sandberg sebastian friedel took over the training of the five construction yard men. ""Fire department and building yard benefit from cooperation"", schmidt and friedel are sure. When, for example, sewers or culverts have to be reeled in, this can now be done by the fire truck from the building yard itself. A specialist company is no longer necessary for this purpose. ""At the same time, this has the advantage that the building yard workers are familiar with the pump, which in turn is necessary for fire department operations"", friedel explained. Uncomplicated material use
But also material and equipment of the building yard can be used in the future for fire department operations without any complications. Schmidt is thinking of the chain saw for removing storm damage, as well as the wheel loader or tractor. ""And if we only manage traffic, we can support each other."" The instruction and familiarization of the firefighters from the building yard included training on the technical equipment, instruction in the firefighting equipment house and in the firefighting vehicle. Udo kaiser is also available as a driver for the fire truck. The schmalwasser commander christian holzheimer has already included the building yard employees in the alarm system, so that they are automatically notified by text message in the event of an operation. Working for the fire department is not linked to the working hours of the building yard, schmidt made clear. ""When there's a fire, we come running."" The support of the building yard is important, especially during the day, when many active firefighters are out at work. ""This period can be well covered by the building yard,"" explains, says friedel. ""We are ready to do our best. It is important that we have the fire department and that we can now support it"", summarized schmidt. Your email address will not be published.
