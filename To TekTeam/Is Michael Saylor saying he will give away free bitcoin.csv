,,Why is a blatant scam depicting Michael Saylor asking for Bitcoin allowed to be shown as an advertisement on Youtube?," Youtube is running advertisements that are blatant scams. I've ran into another one watching various youtube videos, and all essentially depict Michael Saylor going on about a new product or service being offered for Bitcoin. It uses a video of him in his chair and AI technology to depict his voice. They're about a minute long and essentially all the same. It's the age old ""send x amount of bitcoin and receive double the amount back. I thought seeing one was weird, but now I've seen a couple and thought I'd say something to bring awareness about this. I took a screenshot of what the advertisement looks like. https://imgur.com/gallery/o6XMq5f How does this even happen on youtube? Do they not do quality control of the advertisements that they put on their platform? The scam couldn't be anymore in your face, and I get you have to be pretty gullible to fall for it, but this is ridiculous. I just wanted to bring some attention to it, and apologize if it's been mentioned before. Bitcoin pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below.

I‚Äôve seen this scam ad along with ones for Cardano, XRP, and Solana. I report them each time but not sure google gives a flying fuck. Honestly, they should be held liable for anyone who becomes a victim. Will probably never happen, though. There's an ETH one with Vitalik as well. It's almost convincing due to the fact he's normally awkward as hell lol It‚Äôs actually so fucked how they‚Äôll de monetize creators for the smallest little infraction but let scam channels and ads run without any intervention. yt has long run ads that are blatant scams. AI has really stepped up to enable these scams too. YT needs to be taken to task for it. I never see such egregiously bad marketing on other platforms of similar size. FB had a time when they were pretty bad, but I've noticed the blatant scams are cut - or at least I don't see them anymore. Maybe YouTube should step up their AI game to detect these scam ads. I've seen them all too. XRP, ADA, then the new government stimulus scam ads too. It's at least 80% of ads. YouTube will take the advertising fee without vetting the company, and then once all the reports come in, they stop the advertisement and keep the money. The scammer don't care because they always make it back, then rinse and repeat We haven't even scratched the surface of this. Media companies better get on the fuckin ball right now. This is important. They NEED to have dedicated fact checking and digital analysis teams ready. The whole thing that Sorkin wrote about in ""The Newsroom"" Is already out of control and it's gonna get exponentially worse. We need something like the Fairness Doctrine in place again and other regulations on ""opinion/entertainment networks"" when it comes to labeling them news and making sure they aren't a part of the equal airtime thing We just had a post about an XRP scam a few days ago - that one was up for at least a month even though many users (me included) have reported it multiple times. The answer is: Youtube allows this as long as the advertisers pay. Scam is now part of their portfolio, or at least they told me clearly it's not breaking their ToS.

,,Michael Saylor scam ad," Just saw a Saylor ad offering to give out free Bitcoin on YT. It‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs funny. His mouth is moving so unnaturally and it‚Äôs so poorly edited. He looks like a human rabbit and it looks like a 12 year old edited the scam ad. It‚Äôs unfortunate that Google looks the other way whenever a scam crypto commercial is reported on YT. Saw this too. Reported it but I'm sure YouTube allows these things deliberately. Spread more scam stories for bitcoin. I saw it and did the same, kinda clever to make it look live I thought. I really hope MicroStrategy complains to TY about the infringement I reported it and received a written statement within 24h, from the Google Trust & Safety-Team - their statement: this is against the Google policy and they took action‚Ä¶this was 4 days ago.. so it is back again? Saylor, Vitalik, Garlinghouse, Anatoli are all featured in these ""2 for 1"" advertisements on YT. I keep reporting these scam ads but nothing ever seems to happen. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen from the kind folks like yourself who take the time to report. Google doesn‚Äôt give two shits. Maybe someone getting scammed big money and suing Google will make them reassess. I see those a lot and report them. Excellent. Have you ever received any genuine response where they took it serious and said they investigate them? I‚Äôve seen some screen grabs where the Google rep said the ads reported didn‚Äôt violate any policy. Hopefully some Google reps will take it seriously and put forth an effort to remove/ban these. Unfortunately some naive and greedy people will be taken in. No one is going to send you back double your btc...that should be obvious to everyone, but it isn't. Google is pretty heavy handed with various censorship but are cool with scammers stealing not only crypto but the image of various finance and business folks without their permission(Saylor, Elon and Brad from xRP) Someone posted in this sub not too long ago after falling for this scam.

,,Michael Saylor Bitcoin Scam.," I lost 2 Bitcoin! Don‚Äôt fall for it! They place banners and do voice overs on various interviews of Micheal Saylor found on YouTube. Last week they sent you to www.ms-give.com Yesterday they were at it again directing you to www.ms-net. If you have been scammed please go to the FBI sites IC3 and make a complaint. They will do nothing until they have enough complaints. I adore Michael Saylor and am so upset that they are using his name and content to steal our coins. God bless Bitcoin I was scammed a few months ago too when I first started out, its the worst feeling. Gotta keep spreading the word ‚Äúnobody is EVERRRRRR going go double your Bitcoin‚Äù if you see a giveaway its probably a scam. Exactly, also social media has been the most place for this. I have recently shut down a couple of requests like this on my Facebook and twitter after I got to know what's really going behind it.
Additionally, keep an eye on the network when making a transfer as I have seen, many have lost their precious money due to network issues. Isn't this a pattern in crypto scams? They lure you into some event or something like that on social media and in response ask you to deposit a small amount of crypto in their account for a giveaway or some hacks and that way they steal your money.

,,What actually is Michael Saylor's bitcoin strategy?....," ....being more specific than just saying he's accumulating as much bitcoin as he can. I Googled it but can only find pieces of it. he stepped down from ceo last year, but at the time he was the longest sitting ceo of a single corporation in wall st history. he‚Äôs shared stories of seeing ceos destroy companies by trying to beat inflation and stay profitable by buying companies, merging with companies, buying back stocks etc. when covid happened and the money printer went brrrrr he realized that no matter what he did, microstrategy was in a dire situation in that no matter how many hours he asked his employees to work or how many employees he hired, they could not keep making more profits to beat inflation since the money they earn and saved was being devalued. so he did a drastic move and went all in on bitcoin which cannot be manipulated or devalued. in today‚Äôs economic environment no one can beat inflation with their income alone, they need to take risks like invest in the stock market, buy real estate, have a side gig etc. corporations are in the same boat, they need to merge with other companies, buy other companies or buyback stocks etc. but as i explained those generally destroy corporations in the long run. so saylor‚Äôs strategy using his own metaphor is to stop fighting the wind of inflation by paddling harder and instead put up a sail (bitcoin) and harness the wind. bitcoin is volatile but as he says ‚Äúvolatility is vitality‚Äù meaning fiat is stable but is guaranteed to go to zero due to infinite printing whereas bitcoin is volatile but is guaranteed to go up in value due to it‚Äôs strictly limited supply. Is part of his strategy to issue more stock that is immediately sold to buy bitcoin? He‚Äôs also established MSTR as a better than ETF option for institutions that can‚Äôt legally buy BTC but want exposure to BTC; They buy his stock. His massive purchases of late are to fend off the actual ETF issuers. MSTR likely to take a haircut in its stock price when the ETFs hit. He wants to be able to give someone more exposure for less fees by just holding MSTR vs iBTC. I think it was a simple mathematical calculation for Michael. He calculated the true cost of capital was above 20% unlike what the government was claiming inflation was. He realized that if you're not making >20% APY then you are losing purchasing power. The only thing that has a chance of beating 20% is BTC. One thing no commenter has mentioned yet is that microstrategy is issuing shares of stock that people purchase in fiat and then MSTR is using that fiat to purchase Bitcoin. It‚Äôs basically the same concept if you taking out a personal loan to buy bitcoin and then paying off the loan when the bitcoin appreciates.  Buy and hold, because nothing will have a greater value than bitcoin. He believes it i do too maybe we are both fools, I dont think we are. It's funny because I'm rushing to put money into this system and I don't expect to even cash out. it's just exciting to know I'm contributing to a new and amazing prospect that could make the entire World a better place. 14% annualised growth per year hold them forever laura. his strategy is to help raise the price of btc so everyone benefits  ",www.reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18t94ne/what_actually_is_michael_saylors_bitcoin_strategy/,

,,Michael Saylor warns of deepfake crypto scams involving MicroStrategy,"English                                    The recent surge in cryptocurrency giveaway scams has raised concerns, particularly with the involvement of deepfake videos featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. These scams, utilizing AI-generated content, are prevalent on platforms such as YouTube and X, with notable personalities like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also becoming targets. Michael Saylor recently issued a warning after discovering fraudulent deepfake videos circulating on YouTube, falsely portraying him and MicroStrategy engaging in a Bitcoin giveaway. In these videos, the deepfake Saylor encourages viewers to send him Bitcoin, promising to double the amount. Saylor responded to this deceptive tactic by cautioning his followers, emphasizing the absence of a ‚Äúfree lunch‚Äù in the cryptocurrency space. The misleading video not only promotes the fake giveaway. They also make audacious claims, including predicting that the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would drive the price of BTC to an astonishing $1 million. Those who click on the video link are directed to a scam website claiming to host the ‚Äúbiggest crypto giveaway,‚Äù boasting 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH up for grabs. The website employs urgency, urging immediate participation with limited spots available and no prerequisite crypto knowledge. The deceptive website outlines the event, promising participants a share of 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH, emphasizing exclusivity with the statement, ‚ÄúYou can only participate once!‚Äù The deepfake Saylor on the site encourages investors to scan a QR code, ostensibly leading to the giveaway. It is noteworthy that Michael Saylor recently disclosed plans to sell $216 million worth of MicroStrategy shares to bolster his Bitcoin holdings. While the exact amount of BTC he currently owns remains undisclosed, Saylor shared in October 2020 that he possesses 17,732 BTC. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, the software intelligence firm under Saylor‚Äôs leadership, publicly reported holdings of 189,150 bitcoins as of December 2023. The prevalence of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts underscores a growing trend in the misuse of AI-generated content. These scams exploit the trust and credibility associated with influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry to deceive unsuspecting individuals. Investors are urged to exercise caution and skepticism when confronted with sensational claims or promises of free cryptocurrency. The saying ‚Äúthere is no such thing as a free lunch‚Äù resonates particularly in the volatile and often deceptive realm of cryptocurrencies. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of verifying information, especially in an environment where misinformation and fraudulent schemes abound. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, so does the creativity of scammers seeking to exploit the enthusiasm surrounding these digital assets. The rise of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency investors, featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance within the community. Read More One of the largest international banks on the planet, Standard Chartered has recently predicted that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank stated those funds could be seen in 2024, following approval of the investment product. Industry experts have increased their expectations of the product‚Äôs approval in the coming days, with many expecting approval to arrive by Wednesday of this week. Moreover, Standard Chartered has forecasted a massive price increase for the digital asset following approval of the more than a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently contemplating. JUST IN: Standard Charter Bank says #Bitcoin could see $50-100 billion in spot ETF inflows upon approval in 2024. Also Read: Bitcoin: Standard Chartered Says ETF to Bring 165% Gain in 2024 For the last several months, anticipation over a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States has reached a fever pitch. The digital asset industry is anxiously awaiting a decision on the host of applications. Subsequently, many are predicting what such an approval could mean for the industry as a whole. Among them is Standard Chartered Bank, which says that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank notes that the inflows will be between $50 and $100 billion. Additionally, they expect a massive impact on the price over the next year. Also Read: All Spot Bitcoin ETF Applicants Submit S-1 Final Amendments The bank also noted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $200,000 by the end of 2025.

,,Michael Saylor Issues Crucial Bitcoin (BTC) Warning,"Founder of MicroStrategy business intelligence giant Michael Saylor addressed the Bitcoin community, warning them about a new threat posed by the advancing development of artificial intelligence technologies. In the middle of December, a similar warning was made by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.

Those scam videos featured Saylor, Bitcoin trading and cryptocurrency giveaway scams every 15 minutes, per the Bitcoin evangelist. His tweet contained several ‚Äúwarning sign‚Äù emojis. He warned the community, saying ‚ÄúBe careful out there, and remember there is no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù The screenshots Saylor posted show ‚Äúhim‚Äù talking about the Bitcoin ETF likely to propel the Bitcoin price to the $1 million level. ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning‚ö†Ô∏è My security team has been taking down one AI generated deepfake video featuring me, @MicroStrategy, and #Bitcoin trading & giveaway scams on @YouTube every 15 minutes.

In the middle of December, Charles Hoskinson also commented on a tweet featuring a deep-fake video with him talking about a ‚ÄúCardano giveaway.‚Äù Hoskinson admitted that so far this video is imperfect and this is clearly visible; however, he believes that within the next two-three years, these AI-generated scam videos will become a lot more sophisticated and then hardly anyone will be able to tell reality from ‚ÄúAI fiction.‚Äù Many experts are expecting AI technologies to undergo a great deal of development within the next few years. Elon Musk, the founder of xAI and Grok chatbot, is among them. He believes that humanity is less than three years away from AI making new discoveries in physics, writing novels and generally from getting significantly better at anything humans are good at.

Conduct your own research by contacting financial experts before making any investment decisions. We believe that all content is accurate as of the date of publication, but certain offers mentioned may no longer be available. Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy who stepped down as the company CEO in August to focus on its further Bitcoin strategy and acquisitions, has engaged himself in a debate with Swedish researcher and current CIO of Arcane Assets fund Eric Wall regarding the Bitcoin Lightning Network. As part of it, Saylor decided to give away some Bitcoin. Eric Wall created a public poll on his Twitter page to pick his followers' brains to see if they believe the former chief of MicroStrategy has ever made more than three transactions using the Bitcoin Lightning Network. Saylor responded ""yes"" to that and promised to make ""three more transactions,"" each carrying 1,000,000 Satoshis, to three people who post memes about the Lightning Network in the comments to the tweet and who get the biggest amount of likes. The correct answer is Yes, and I will make three more transactions of 1,000,000 sats each to the 3 posters of the most liked #Lightning‚ö°Ô∏è memes in the comments below. https://t.co/qXZ90q4Ly9 This trolling of Saylor by Arcane Assets CIO began, apparently, after Saylor announced that MicroStrategy had begun developing its own SaaS (software as a service) based on Bitcoin Lightning Network in order to provide enterprises with solutions to enable new e-commerce use cases. In the comment thread, Wall continued making fun of Saylor, launching a Twitter poll that suggested that the aforementioned post about the BTC giveaway was published by Saylor's assistant.   Despite the fact that Saylor quit his position as chief executive, he remains in the company as an executive chairman. The position of CEO has been passed to Phong Le, who has been the company's president since 2020. Michael Saylor will now focus more on the firm's Bitcoin acquisition strategies and products based on the flagship cryptocurrency and, as we see from the said debate, on Bitcoin Lightning Network. Presently, MicroStrategy holds approximately 130,000 Bitcoins ‚Äì it has been buying BTC since August 2020 ‚Äì and is the company with the biggest amount of BTC on its balance sheet. This sum of BTC is worth roughly $3.9 billion at the time of writing. Disclaimer: The opinions expressed here are not investment advice; they are provided for informational purposes only.

,,The Giveaway Scams are Still Going: Using Microstrategy CEO to Steal From Hopeful Hodlers,"A new giveaway scam has just launched and is reeling in a few unsuspecting people, so once again, we remind our reader to be vigilant and not to fall for these. Table of Contents This time its the website https://bitcoin22.io/ and according to details on the site, each hodler of the digital asset has a chance to receive extra amount of Bitcoin by joining the giveaway. The site also includes a portrait of Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor as well as the brand emblem to make it more trustworthy. In November 2021, the figure of the CEO of Microstrategy was used for a Bitcoin scam. An impersonator of Michael Saylor took more than $4 million from victims in a gifting scam. The format of that scam seemed similar and the tagline showed less difference: ‚Äú Hurry up and take part in the giveaway of 5000 BTC.‚Äù The only difference is the amount promised. Despite the fact that Bitcoin‚Äôs global adoption has increased in recent years, there are still a lot of roadblocks in the way of public acceptance. Unlike traditional money transactions, which must go through an intermediary and incur various service fees, Bitcoin transactions can be made directly between participants at no cost. The unusual behavior has resulted in civil, commercial, and criminal lawsuits based on fraud and the misappropriation of millions of dollars in actual money. Scammers frequently imitate celebrities, such as Michael Saylor, and then request that the user donate bitcoins to a certain address. To generate trust, they offer to quadruple the amount of cryptocurrency that investors deposit. MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO, Saylor, is a huge advocate of cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy has purchased up to 114,042 BTC since August, making it the highest Bitcoin holding of any publicly traded business. At current market prices, the holdings are worth more than $6.57 billion. Scammers have imitated Tesla CEO Elon Musk, as well as government institutions and well-known businesses, in addition to Saylor. Around May 2021, cyber thieves took more than $2 million in bogus presents tied to Musk, according to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The scam involving the Indian Prime Minister‚Äôs Twitter account, which occurred on December 12 of last year, is particularly significant. Hackers gained access to Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs Twitter account, saying that India had purchased a big amount of bitcoin and was distributing it to citizens across the country. A fraudulent link was attached by the hackers. With over 73 million followers on Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the most popular incumbent politician. His Twitter announcement drew a lot of attention and was swiftly deleted. The incident occurred on December 12th, as India moves to stifle burgeoning cryptocurrency trading with a new law expected to be introduced in parliament this month. The Prime Minister‚Äôs account had been hacked for a short time, according to the regulatory agency, but Twitter had returned access to him. This is the second time Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs social account has been hacked under cyber attack. Last year, his other Twitter account was also hijacked and sent a tweet urging the public to donate to a fake Covid-19 relief fund. In recent years, cryptocurrency fraud has risen substantially. The business appears to have succumbed to its own success, as fraud cases are often linked to the rapid rise in digital asset prices. Nicholas Say was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

BeInCrypto attempted to access the website but received an error message. The fraudsters typically pose as a celebrity, in this case Michael Saylor, before asking users to send bitcoin to a designated address. They promise to multiply the cryptocurrency that investors send ‚Äì the giveaway ‚Äì but make off with the money instead. This time, a BTC user lost $179,000 to the scammers. At the time of writing, the primary bitcoin address in question received more than $4.16 million, or 72.14 BTC, in total, from 49 transactions. The current value of the address is $590,000 or 16.7 BTC. Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a big supporter of cryptocurrencies. Since August last year, MicroStrategy has bought up to 114,042 BTC ‚Äì the largest holding of any publicly-traded company. The holdings are worth over $6.57 billion at current market prices. Scammers aren‚Äôt only pretending to be Saylor. They also impersonate Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as government agencies or well-known businesses. In the instance of Musk, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported that online criminals stole more than $2 million in fake giveaways related to the influential billionaire during the six months to May 2021. Crypto fraud has risen sharply in recent years. The industry appears to have become a victim of its own success, as incidents of fraud tend to be linked to the exponential growth in digital asset prices. In 2020, crypto fraudsters targeted Twitter and took over high-profile accounts on the social media platform, including that of Musk. The scammers made off with over $120,000 in bitcoin from the hack. Open account on KuCoin & get a guaranteed bonus up to 700 USDT.

,,Michael Saylor Issues Critical Warning to BTC Holders,"     U.Today - Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy chairman, a leading business intelligence company and one of the largest Bitcoin holders, has issued a crucial warning to the Bitcoin community. He revealed that his security team has been taking down deep-fake videos generated by artificial intelligence (AI) that feature him promoting Bitcoin scams. Saylor revealed that his team pulls down roughly 80 fake AI-generated YouTube videos every day, but scammers continue to create more. The MicroStrategy chairman took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his worry and warn the crypto community about fake podcasts urging users to scan a barcode and send Bitcoin to receive double the amount back. These are typical Bitcoin scam tactics that aim to deceive and steal from unsuspecting victims. In this light, Saylor warns BTC holders that there is no risk-free way to double their Bitcoin, and MicroStrategy does not give away BTC to those who scan a barcode. He also urges them to always verify and not blindly trust. Saylor is not the only renowned crypto personality to be targeted by AI scammers. In November 2023, deep-fake videos of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse promoting fake XRP giveaways emerged on social media. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a sophisticated and quickly expanding technology that can generate realistic and convincing digital content such as photos, videos, audio and text. While artificial intelligence has many positive and beneficial applications, it can also be used for malicious purposes. The crypto community should be aware of the possible risks posed by AI and take action to safeguard their holdings. Some of the best practices for avoiding AI scams include verifying the source and authenticity of any information or offer related to crypto before taking any action. They should also never send crypto to unknown or untrusted addresses or platforms, especially if they promise unrealistic returns or rewards.

,,Michael Saylor Says There Is No Reason to Sell Bitcoin Anytime Soon,"MicroStrategy executive chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor says there is no reason to sell any of his Bitcoin anytime soon, in an interview with Bloomberg‚Äôs Katie Greifeld on Tuesday. Saylor said the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETFs is a rising tide that is going to lift all boats ‚Äì this phrase is metaphorically associated with the idea that as the market improves this will benefit all participants. ‚ÄúBut if you look at what the spot ETFs are doing ‚Äì they are facilitating the digital transformation of capital and every day hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analogue ecosystem into the digital economy,‚Äù adds Saylor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever,‚Äù adding  ‚ÄúBitcoin, is the exit strategy,‚Äù  Saylor told Bloomberg. The MicroStrategy chairman is making his rounds in the media and was recently quoted saying there is over a decade of pent-up demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, in an interview with CNBC. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs 10 years of pent-up demand people been waiting for these ETFs and finally, mainstream investors are able to access Bitcoin and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving the surge of capital in the asset class,‚Äù said Saylor. The MicroStrategy chairman discussed the state of the crypto industry, the rollout of bitcoin ETFs, bitcoin‚Äôs climbing valuation, and future plans. In the interview, Saylor also explained that MicroStrategy will be rebranding as a Bitcoin development company. He explained, that the rebrand was a natural decision due to the company‚Äôs success in its Bitcoin strategy and unique status as the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin. Saylor highlighted plans to develop software, generate cash flow, and leverage the capital markets to accumulate more Bitcoin for shareholders and promote the growth of the Bitcoin network. MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin investment has soared beyond the $10 billion mark, owning over 190,000 BTC as Bitcoin‚Äôs value climbs past $50,000. This achievement underscores MicroStrategy‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects and its utility as an inflation hedge, writes Arslan Butt from Cryptonews. Since joining the Bitcoin market in August 2020, MicroStrategy‚Äôs BTC portfolio has expanded significantly, even amidst the bear market‚Äôs challenges in early 2022. Despite experiencing a downturn in its fourth-quarter revenue and profit, MicroStrategy, under Michael Saylor‚Äôs leadership, continued to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, purchasing an additional 850 BTC for $37.2 million in January alone.

,,Michael Saylor to forever buy Bitcoin ‚Äì ‚ÄòNo reason to sell the winner‚Äô,"            Cointelegraph Team
Cointelegraph
Follow Michael Saylor has no plans to sell Bitcoin, even as the holdings of his company MicroStrategy have swelled to reach an unrealized profit just shy of $4 billion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever. Bitcoin is the exit strategy,‚Äù Saylor said, speaking to Bloomberg on Feb. 20 when asked if his firm would sell its 190,000 BTC stash ‚Äî worth around $9.88 billion at current prices. Outlining his bullish case for Bitcoin (BTC $51,372), Saylor claimed the cryptocurrency is ‚Äútechnically superior‚Äù to gold, the S&P 500 and real estate, despite each asset class having a far greater market capitalization than Bitcoin‚Äôs $1 trillion. ‚ÄúWe believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes. And that being the case, there‚Äôs just no reason to sell the winner to buy the losers.‚Äù MicroStrategy ‚Äî a business intelligence software firm ‚Äî became the first publicly traded company to start scooping up Bitcoin in 2020. The 190,000 BTC it held as of the fourth quarter of 2023 cost an average of $31,224 each, bringing MicroStrategy‚Äôs total investment cost to $5.93 billion. United States-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), excluding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), hold an estimated 270,000 BTC as of Friday, Feb. 16, according to HODL15Capital data. Saylor said the demand for Bitcoin, generated by a growing appetite for ETF products, ‚Äúhas been far in excess of the supply from the miners,‚Äù sometimes up to ‚Äú10 times as much.‚Äù However, he brushed off concerns that the ETFs would make it harder for MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin, saying it employs a ‚Äúlevered operating strategy‚Äù for investment in the digital asset. ‚ÄúThe spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre facilitating the digital transformation of capital, and every day, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a rising tide. It‚Äôs going to lift all boats,‚Äù he said. Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

,,Michael Saylor Claims Will Continue to Buy Bitcoin,"Source : Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash

Michael Saylor, one of the founders of MicroStrategy, stated that he will not sell Bitcoin and will continue to buy it.
 
In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday, Michael Saylor was asked if his company would sell the 190,000 BTC it holds.


Saylor confidently responded that he and his company will always buy Bitcoin and referred to Bitcoin as an exit strategy.

""I will buy that asset (Bitcoin) forever. Bitcoin is the exit strategy; it is the strongest asset, so what we are seeing now is Bitcoin emerging as a trillion-dollar asset class. And it sits alongside names like Apple, Google, and Microsoft,"" Saylor emphasized.

Saylor views Bitcoin as an asset that is inherently ""superior,"" surpassing even established giants like gold and the S&P 500.

This strong conviction has driven MicroStrategy's recent transformation into a ""Bitcoin Development Company,"" demonstrating their dedication to developing the digital currency ecosystem. Source: Photo by Dmytro Demidko on Unsplash
In the interview, Saylor also mentioned that the approval of a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US has opened the floodgates for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem, with demand outstripping current supply.

Saylor also dismissed concerns that the ETF would make it difficult for MicroStrategy to buy Bitcoin, stating that they use ""operational leverage strategy"" to invest in digital assets.
""If you look at what the ETFs are doing, they are facilitating the transformation of digital capital. And every day, hundreds of millions of dollars of capital flow from the traditional analog ecosystem to the digital economy,"" he said.

As a leading Bitcoin holder since 2020, MicroStrategy has amassed over 190,000 BTC, with an average purchase price of $31,224, making MicroStrategy's total investment cost $5.93 billion.

Last year, despite increasing losses, MicroStrategy continued to buy Bitcoin. In January, Saylor sold $216 million in MicroStrategy private stock options to buy more Bitcoin.

As of February, with the price of Bitcoin at $50,000, MicroStrategy is in a profitable position with an investment value of approximately $10 billion.  This content aims to enrich reader information.

,,Bitcoin User Loses Record $1.1M in Scam Michael Saylor Giveaway,"We use cookies to improve your experience.   A bitcoin user on Saturday lost $1.14 million to online thieves posing as MicroStrategy chief executive officer Michael Saylor. The user sent the equivalent of 26.4 bitcoins (BTC) to an address confirmed by crypto tracking service Whale Alert as a bitcoin scam. A nightmare come true, Whale Alert said, ‚Äúthis scam received the single largest payment ever to a fake giveaway.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe suspect this payment was made through a Coinbase address,‚Äù added the outfit, famous for tracking large-scale bitcoin transactions. It said the theft occurred via this website and on YouTube, both ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù scam platforms used by con-artists to impersonate Saylor. The YouTube channel has since been taken down, and a visit to the website returns an error message. The 26.4 BTC was sent to the primary scam address in five transactions, according to a record of the payments. The loot is worth $1.14 million at current market prices. The giveaway scam uses the identities of celebrities such as Michael Saylor in order to trick people into sending them bitcoin. They promise to multiply the crypto that investors send ‚Äì the giveaway ‚Äì but make off with the money instead. Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has been a big supporter of bitcoin. Since August 2020, his company bought 124,391 BTC ‚Äî the largest holding of any publicly-traded entity. The holdings are currently valued at $5.39 billion.

We report them every 15 minutes and they are taken down after a few hours, but the scammers just launch more. This is the latest fake giveaway involving Saylor. In November, someone sent nearly 3 BTC ($179,000), to a different giveaway impersonating the MicroStrategy head. Scammers aren‚Äôt only pretending to be Saylor. They also impersonate Tesla CEO Elon Musk as well as government agencies or well-known businesses. Whale Alert said in a 2020 report that cybercriminals are finding it very easy to fool people of their bitcoin because their schemes have become believably professional and aggressive. After analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points, it concluded that ‚Äúcrypto crime pays. A lot.‚Äù This is mainly because the bitcoin scam business is almost risk-free, as perpetrators have an extremely low chance of getting caught. Whale Alert says it tracks 9,214 scam websites and 92,955 fraudulent crypto addresses. To date, it has tracked over $803 million in stolen digital assets worldwide.

,,MICHAEL SAYLOR IMPERSONATED TO RUN GIVEAWAY SCAM,"TL;DR Breakdown Chief Executive Officer of Business intelligence firm MicroStrategy‚Äô Michael Saylor has been impersonated to run a fake crypto giveaway scam. They garnered over $1m in Bitcoin with the operation. The scam comes in the wake of many others that have become a threat to the crypto industry. Perpetrators pretend to be a famous person from the community and offer to double all BTC that users send to their wallets. Afterward, all BTC that is transferred to the scammers‚Äô addresses are lost, and the victim does not receive anything in return. As funny and cheap as giveaway scams sound, people continue to fall victim quite frequently in the hope of getting free money. Michael Saylor, whose company owns the most BTC and a personal HODLer himself, is frequently impersonated. His impersonation was revealed during the weekend as Whale Alert reported one address confirmed to be a Saylor-impersonating scam. Although it has been active for less than a month (January only), the wallet has attracted more than $1.1 million worth of bitcoin, reflecting how dangerous the scam could be. Saylor himself eventually commented on Whale Alert‚Äôs post later on, indicating that nearly 500 such scams went live on YouTube in just one week. 489 of these scams were launched on YouTube last week. We report them every 15 minutes and they are taken down after a few hours, but the scammers just launch more‚Ä¶ He said his team continues to report them ‚Äúevery 15 minutes, and they are taken down after a few hours,‚Äù but they continue to pop up frequently. Cryptocurrency giveaway scams have been a problem for those involved in the crypto-community since the last major bull run in late 2017. Giveaway scams are a form of social engineering in which a scammer attempts to deceive a cryptocurrency investor into believing that a major cryptocurrency exchange or celebrity is hosting a giveaway. The catch here is that in order to participate in the giveaway, you must first send a certain amount of cryptocurrency to a giveaway address so that you can verify your wallet address and receive your share of the giveaway.

,,Scam Alert: MicroStrategy.Fund Bitcoin Giveaway Scam Amasses Over $400k,"Fraudsters are impersonating MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO, Michael Saylor, via the website MicroStrategy.fund. Like most Bitcoin giveaway scams, the MicroStrategy.Fund scam is asking users to send BTC or ETH to a designated address with the hope of getting twice the amount back.   The scheme attracts participants by hijacking YouTube channels with millions of followers and then playing a clip of a Michael Saylor interview. The description and a link provided to the streaming video playback then directs users to the fake website to participate in the Microstrategy.fund scam. Michael J. Saylor is quoted as the main sponsor of the giveaway, with users being told they can only participate once.  As shown above, the fake  YouTube channel has over 6 million subscribers, compared to MicroStrategy‚Äôs official YouTube channel that has less than 20,000 subscribers. Sadly, the above MicroStrategy.fund scam is also popping up on Google searches for ‚ÄúMicroStrategy YouTube.‚Äù  Fraudsters are building on the goodwill that MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has built in the past year, making his company the largest known corporate bitcoin holding company. Earlier this week, the company breached the 100,000 BTC milestone and has held on to the stack despite current market conditions. But no, MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt giving away any of its bitcoins and doesn‚Äôt even hold Ether (ETH). At the time of writing, it is difficult to determine exactly how much the giveaway scam has amassed, with the video having been online for over three hours. The primary BTC address has a balance of over 12 BTC (appr. $370,000) and has moved 13 BTC (appr. $400,000) in an apparent attempt to convince unsuspecting users that they are indeed sending bitcoins back. On the other hand, the Ethereum address has mainly seen inflows, and now has a balance of over 20 ETH ($37,600). With the recent bull run and the industry seeing an influx of new entrants, the MicroStrategy.fund scam is apparently thriving, and we strongly advise readers against trying to participate. You simply won‚Äôt get any money back! Following the publication of this MicroStrategy scam alert article, readers brought it to our notice that scammers are also using other URLs such as mstrategy.io and btc2022.io/btc.

,,Michael J. Saylor,"Michael J. Saylor (born February 4, 1965) is an American entrepreneur and business executive. He is the executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services. Saylor was MicroStrategy's chief executive officer from 1989 to 2022. He authored the 2012 book The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. He is also the sole trustee of Saylor Academy, a provider of free online education. As of 2016, Saylor had been granted 31 patents and had 9 additional applications under review.[2] Saylor is an advocate of Bitcoin, stating that he believes it will replace gold as the global store-of-value asset.[3][4] Saylor was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on February 4, 1965, and spent his early years on various Air Force bases around the world, as his father was an Air Force chief master sergeant. When Saylor was 11, the family settled in Fairborn, Ohio, near the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.[5][6] In 1983, Saylor enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on an Air Force ROTC scholarship.[5][6] He joined the Theta Delta Chi fraternity, through which he met the future co-founder of MicroStrategy, Sanju Bansal.[6][7] He graduated from MIT in 1987, with a double major in aeronautics and astronautics; and science, technology, and society. A medical condition prevented him from becoming a pilot,[5][6] and instead, he got a job with a consulting firm, The Federal Group, Inc. in 1987, where he focused on computer simulation modeling for a software integration company.[7] In 1988, Saylor became an internal consultant at DuPont, where he developed computer models to help the company anticipate change in its key markets. The simulations predicted that there would be a recession in many of DuPont's major markets in 1990.[5][7] Using the funds from DuPont, Saylor founded MicroStrategy with Sanju Bansal, his MIT fraternity brother.[6] The company began developing software for data mining, then focused on software for business intelligence. In 1992, MicroStrategy won a $10 million contract with McDonald's to develop applications to analyze the efficiency of its promotions. The contract with McDonald's led Saylor to realize that his company could create business intelligence software that would allow companies to use their data for insights into their businesses.[6][7][5][8][9] Saylor took the company public in June 1998, with an initial stock offering of 4 million shares priced at $12 each.[10] The stock price doubled on the first day of trading.[11] By early 2000, Saylor's net worth reached $7 billion, and the Washingtonian reported that he was the wealthiest man in the Washington D.C. area.[5] In 1996, Saylor was named KPMG Washington High-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year.[7][12] In 1997, Ernst & Young named Saylor its Software Entrepreneur of the Year, and the following year, Red Herring Magazine recognized him as one of its Top 10 Entrepreneurs for 1998.[13] Saylor was also featured by the MIT Technology Review as an ""Innovator Under 35"" in 1999.[14] On August 8, 2022, Saylor resigned as CEO and remained executive chairman of MicroStrategy. Phong Le, the company's president, succeeded him as CEO. Saylor said in a press release, ""As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.""[15] As of 2023, he owns 2,407,408 shares, about 18.1% of the total outstanding, and has 64.7% of the voting power.[16] In March 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought charges against Saylor and two other MicroStrategy executives for the company's inaccurate reporting of financial results for the preceding two years.[17] In December 2000, Saylor settled with the SEC without admitting wrongdoing by paying $350,000 in penalties and a personal disgorgement of $8.3 million.[18][19][20] As a result of the restatement of results, the company's stock declined in value and Saylor's net worth fell by $6 billion.[21][22] In a 3,000-word memo to all MicroStrategy employees on March 16, 2020, entitled ""My Thoughts on COVID-19,"" Saylor criticized countermeasures then being recommended against the disease, saying that it is ""soul-stealing and debillitating [sic] to embrace the notion of social distancing & economic hibernation"" and predicting that in the worst-case scenario, global life expectancy would only ""click down by a few weeks."" Saylor also refused to close MicroStrategy's offices unless he was legally required to do so. The full content of the memo appeared on Reddit for only a few minutes and was reposted in the Washington Business Journal.[23][24] On MicroStrategy's quarterly earnings conference call in July 2020, Saylor announced his intention for MicroStrategy to explore purchasing Bitcoin, gold, or other alternative assets instead of holding cash. The following month, MicroStrategy used $250 million from its cash stockpile to purchase 21,454 Bitcoin.[25] MicroStrategy later added $175 million of Bitcoin to its holdings in September 2020 and another $50 million in early December 2020. On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it had sold $650 million in convertible senior notes, taking on debt to increase its Bitcoin holdings to over $1 billion worth. On December 21, 2020, MicroStrategy announced their total holdings include 70,470 bitcoins purchased for $1.125 billion at an average price of $15,964 per bitcoin.[26] As of February 24, 2021 holdings include 90,531 bitcoins acquired for $2.171 billion at an average price of $23,985 per bitcoin.[27] Saylor, who controls 70% of MicroStrategy's shares, dismissed concerns by observers that the move is turning MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin investment firm or exchange-traded fund (ETF).[28] In October 2020, Saylor disclosed he personally held 17,732 bitcoin at an average purchase price of $9,882. As of October 2021, he had not sold any bitcoin.[29] Between October 1 and November 29, 2021, MicroStrategy bought 7,002 bitcoins for about $414.4 million in cash at an average purchase price of $59,187, bringing its total holdings to 121,044 bitcoins.[30][31] Through April 2023, Microstrategy has purchased 140,000 bitcoin for an average price of $29,803.[32] In August 2022, Saylor resigned as CEO, remaining as executive chairman, to focus more on bitcoin.[33] On August 31, 2022, the Attorney General for the District of Columbia sued Saylor for tax fraud, accusing him of illegally avoiding more than $25 million in D.C. taxes by pretending to be a resident of other jurisdictions. MicroStrategy was accused of collaborating with Saylor to facilitate his tax evasion by misreporting his residential address to local and federal tax authorities and failing to withhold D.C. taxes.[34] Saylor issued a statement saying: ""I respectfully disagree with the position of the District of Columbia and look forward to a fair resolution in the courts.""[35] In June 2012, Saylor released The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything, published by Perseus Books, which discusses trends in mobile technology and their future impact on commerce, healthcare, education, and the developing world.[36] The book appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list, where it was ranked number seven in hardcover non-fiction books in August 2012,[37] and was ranked number five in hardcover business books on the Wall Street Journal's Best-Sellers list in July 2012.[38] In 1999, Saylor established The Saylor Foundation (later named Saylor Academy), of which he is the sole trustee. Saylor.org was launched in 2008 as the free education initiative of The Saylor Foundation.[39] ",en.wikipedia.org,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Saylor,

Speaking to Cointelegraph, CertiK blockchain analyst Jesse Leclere said phishing is evolving in sophistication, and one of the key elements driving its evolution is generative AI. 0xScope researcher Jerry Peng added that AI could form a key component in generating ever-more realistic deep fakes to fool crypto users. On Jan. 9, United States law enforcement officials warned that generative AI tools can lower the technical barrier of entry for would-be scammers. However, Rob Joyce, director of cybersecurity at the National Security Agency, also argued that AI could help authorities hunt down illegal activity more efficiently.

,,Michael Saylor Has Not Been Selling Bitcoin,"  Sign up Sign in Aden Rao (Gen Z Money) Follow Coinmonks 3  Recently there have been rumours that Michael Saylor has been secretly selling Bitcoin. This is not true. The articles and tweets that I have seen made an assumption that the wallet address ‚Äú1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ‚Äù belongs to MicroStrategy (MSTR). This wallet moved 1500 Bitcoin. This wallet has been active since 2019. Based on that, to me, it is pretty clear that this is not MicroStrategy‚Äôs wallet since they began buying Bitcoin in August 2020. This is most likely some exchange‚Äôs wallet.

,,Michael Saylor: Bitcoin's biggest convert,"Having been a declared Bitcoin doubter up until 2020, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy made a dramatic u-turn and has now become one of its biggest cheerleaders, putting his company‚Äôs money where his mouth is to the tune of $1.5bn. Find out what Saylor‚Äôs ‚Äòaha‚Äô moment was, and how‚Äôs he become Bitcoin‚Äôs biggest convert. On December 21, 2020, Saylor's company MicroStrategy committed their cash reserves to Bitcoin. They publicly announced their total holdings included 70,470 bitcoins purchased for $1.125 billion at an average price of $15,964 per bitcoin. He has since followed up with further purchases, taking the total to $1.5bn, but he isn‚Äôt stopping there, raising commercial debt to finance yet more purchasing. With Bitcoin recently hitting its all-time high of $48,226.25, it's an understatement to say that Saylor's investment has paid off.  Saylor has become evangelical about Bitcoin. His Twitter feed reads like a sermon on the benefits of investing in the cryptocurrency. In February 2021 MicroStrategy held a conference titled ""Bitcoin for Corporations"" encouraging institutional investment and attended by representatives of Elon Musk.   So what is Michael Saylor's story? How and why he has become so influential in crypto and assess his critics' validity. Could Saylor be the prophet to finally deliver institutional investment to the world of crypto or is his evangelism simply intended to pump the price and make a killing?  An MIT graduate, Saylor is certainly no fool. His career began in software consulting before establishing his own firm MicroStrategy in the 90s to help companies use their own data to improve operations.

Saylor controls 70% of the company shares with an estimated net worth of around $500 million - though his recent Bitcoin investments  have grown that significantly.  He personally owns 18,000 Bitcoin. Before 2020, Saylor publicly admitted that he didn't believe in Bitcoin, likening it to online gambling  But as he looked for ways to protect his company‚Äôs cash reserves from inflation and how other companies were turning to Bitcoin, he began to change his mind. 2020 brought the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating this inflationary headache, given the massive money printing by the federal level in the US to stop the economy from grinding to a halt.

Quantitative easing has been artificially pumping credit into the financial system since the crisis of 2008, but the level of stimulus in 2020 took this to a whole other level with monetary expansion jumping to around 20%. This led Saylor to re-examine his position on Bitcoin as an asset jumping head first into the Bitcoin rabbit-hole consuming a whole range of literature from the Whitepaper to Saifdean Ammous‚Äô ‚ÄòBitcoin Standard‚Äô Saylor emerged from his educational odyssey a complete convert, convinced that Bitcoin was the solution to protecting his company‚Äôs cash stockpile from inflationary erosion. In July of 2020, Saylor used a MicroStrategy quarterly earnings conference call to signal an intention to explore alternative assets such as Gold and Bitcoin to invest cash holdings.  A month later, MicroStrategy spent $250 million purchasing 21,454 Bitcoin. This was the moment that Saylor entered the world of crypto, but was the warning shot in a blitz of buying. Since then, MicroStrategy has spent nearly $1 billion more on buying Bitcoin and Saylor's media output has been taken over by his bullish position on the cryptocurrency.  This - for an example of his fervent enthusiasm - is his pinned tweet:  Other highlights include:  If Saylor is just attempting a monumental pump and dump, financed by his companies cash treasure chest, it is in plain sight, and if his evangelism is all an act, it is worthy of an Oscar. He has committed to holding Bitcoin for the long term - talking about a 100 year horizon = and already has a website dedicated to education, with Bitcoin becoming a big part of that. .  Saylor seems to truly believe that Bitcoin offers a viable digital alternative to gold. And because of this, it's the ultimate store of value for the 21st century.  An analogy that Saylor likes to make is that holding Bitcoin is like owning a Manhattan block in cyberspace. Its value isn't attached to fiat currencies and it's a secure, long-duration asset.  Among his many podcast and TV appearances he has provided anecdotes that suggest his intentions and concerns are genuine. He recalled the issue faced repatriating profits from a division in Argentina. Unable to simply send USD he was watching the Pesos slowly devalue. He became so desperate he even considered using the money to buy an expensive yacht and sail it to America. Due to currency controls, Saylor struggled to repatriate profits from a division in Argentina, where the Peso was continually declining in value. He became so desperate he even considered using the money to buy an expensive yacht and sail it to America. The recent MicroStrategy conference on Bitcoin is also an indication that Saylor is here to stay. Representatives from Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Tesla and many more were in attendance with the conference to convince corporations to add Bitcoin to their portfolio.  Institutional investment in bitcoin has long been held as the key to ""de-risking"" the currency and delivering long-term stability to crypto. Since the conference, Elon Musk has announced that Tesla has added $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to their portfolio. Could other institutions be about to follow? Saylor certainly believes so.  But what about his critics? Saylor has had trouble with the SEC in the past for inaccurate reporting of financial results and was ordered to pay hefty fines as a result. Furthermore, Saylor has faced criticism for speaking out against Covid-19 restrictions in early 2020.  In the world of crypto, many of his critics claim that his Bitcoin evangelism is simply a method of boosting the price. Whilst this may be partly true, it can't be said that Saylor hasn't put his money where his mouth is. It's also undeniable that his Microstrategy team has done their due diligence to understand Bitcoin's value as a long-term asset.  Saylor isn't perfect. He's a maverick who takes risks and thinks for himself. Because of this, he has become one of the most effective communicators in crypto. Saylor has a proven track record of success in technology since the early 90s and is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. He understands the culture of enthusiasm that surrounds Bitcoin and has emerged as a community leader.  That leadership quality came to the fore as, seeing the damage to Bitcoin's image from the negative perception of its fossil fuel consumption, he took the initiative of forming the Bitcoin Mining Council. A coalition of North American miners keen to promote a positive message around sustainable mining. If Bitcoin is to attract the holy grail of institutional investment, the community needs people like Saylor. People with proven track records of success that are trusted by the traditional investment world and also know how to communicate with the fast-paced, madcap world of crypto. üéì Access all our resources for free ‚Äî hurry, this offer is available for a limited time only!

,,Michael Creadon‚Äôs Post,"  Senior Fintech Executive. Former bond trader. Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Namibia) Thinking a lot lately about Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy who likes to use every spare penny his company has (and debt) to buy more bitcoin. At present, his publicly-traded entity owns $4.68 billion in BTC. In 2021, the company had net revenues of $510 MM. 

On balance - and let's be clear, no one has ever asked me for my opinion on the subject but I'll offer one, nonetheless - I think the strategy is over-the-top, bad risk management, and borderline foolhardy. I get it; Mr. Saylor loves and even adores bitcoin. Presumably, he feels the same way about his shareholders, clients and employees. The problem is, if he's wrong on the price of bitcoin - which cannot be ruled out as a possibility - he risks losing his company, which has been around for almost 35 years. His stock price is no longer a proxy for MicroStrategy earnings or EBITDA, it's purely an out-of-the money option (with a stock kicker) on the future price of bitcoin.

Hey, listen: far be it from me to tell him how to run his business. My concern is others may follow suit and find themselves in a pickle with lawsuits, regulators, counterparties and so on. No doubt he's been as transparent as possible about his company's intentions and he has his board's full support - which he needs - to execute these transactions. If bitcoin goes to the proverbial moon, he could become the wealthiest person on the planet because his holdings of the world's most valuable digital asset are so substantial. According to reports, his firm is now one of the top biggest owners of BTC by any one person or institution anywhere around the globe. While I certainly do admire his conviction, I do openly wonder if this isn't a vainglorious endeavor gone many steps too far. Time will tell, as always. Please do your own research. This isn't financial advice.  Open to comments; but for the sake of kindness, please, let's keep the hysteria and theatrics way down. Business Intelligence System Admin | Data/BI Engineer | Real Estate Investor | Podcast Host | Bitcoiner | Father of 3 | Freedom Maximalist Have you ever listened to the Saylor Series?

The first 4 episodes I was totally entranced and Bitcoin was hardly even mentioned, and supposedly it‚Äôs about bitcoin, but the historical recounting of automation, technology, energy harnessing was extremely interesting and informative.

In the end, it turned my skeptical father in law into a Bitcoiner and he has gone on to further study ancient civilizations and related topics.

A hypothetical for ya:
If Michael Saylor owned all the Bitcoin in existence what would a Bitcoin be worth?

I know my answer‚Ä¶
Curious to hear yours. Chief Operating Officer at AAAUM (OM) Coach: Soccer (Varsity); Basketball (Middle School) Ranney School The regulators initially wanted to regulate bitcoin to protect the average investor! Yeah right and I have a bridge for sale in Brooklyn.  Asking for a friend, how soon before they set an ownership limit on a currency ‚Äúbucking‚Äù to become an alternate currency of choice for those average people they were initially trying to protect.  As more of the larger institution gobble it up, how far removed from the initial concept does it get.  As Barry Fitzgerald said in The Quiet Man when asked if he wanted water in his whiskey, ‚ÄúWhen I drink water, I drink water and when I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey.‚Äù   Founder @ LVS.ai I'd be interested to learn of other companies doing something similar. I guess Elon wasn't the only one with Tesla.  His pitch to investors is more of a cheap financing play.  He claims he can borrow funds at the low end of market rates, cheaper than you, a retail investor could, and buys bitcoin with those funds.  I don‚Äôt think he has to worry about bitcoin going bust.  He would get liquidated way before that. Maximalist The only thing Michael Saylor laments is not buying BTC sooner than he and MicroStategy did. Same applies to many that criticize the move and are late to the game, although that type of latency isn‚Äôt even an issue today. Amongst all options below, where else can we think parking their assets was a better idea? Technology and Media Strategy Simple bet on collapse of financial systems as we know it. He might not be wrong in the very long-term...but will that keep him solvent in the present? Who knows.  To view or add a comment, sign in Senior Fintech Executive. Former bond trader.

Maybe not directly but most certainly indirectly. His Capital One holding (Berkshire Hathaway is the credit card companies biggest shareholder) is reportedly set to plop over $35 billion to purchase Discover. And the rich get richer.

While there is never any shortage of bears to tell you ""Stocks are SOOOO overvalued"" (and maybe, finally, they're right on tech), one of the wealthiest people in the world doesn't seem to think so. And according to reports he is not alone, as mergers and acquisition deals are up some 80% by various measures since last year. Rising stocks and the cheaper cost of money make company buyouts, oh so, much more attractive. I don't think that movie ends anytime soon, either.

""What's in your wallet?"" That tag line has been something I've been meaning to mention for some time now and now is good as any. There's just so much bad advertising and marketing that sometimes it's hard to comprehend why so many people even still have jobs in those areas. And... that sounds much harsher than I meant It to. Let me try that again: why is it hard to come up with a good, catchy, lasting slogan. Well, Capital One figured it a long time ago, and now their payday, in a way, has come. Bigger is usually better in financial services and all roads lead to an inevitable, eventual tie up. For Capital One and Discover, that day has finally come. The tide is nigh. (Made that last phrase up; maybe it'll stick.)  To view or add a comment, sign in Senior Fintech Executive. Former bond trader. Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Namibia) The story of the day, or even this year, from my perspective in terms of crypto has to be Ethereum. Considered dead for the umpteenth time only a few weeks or short months ago, ETH has quietly stormed back into extreme relevance and is now knocking on the door at $3k. A year and a half ago, when SBF got taken away in cuffs, this never seemed at least to some like a possibility we would see once again in our lifetimes. 

To be completely candid, I am not in love with Ethereum myself. Remember: this isn't financial advice. Please do your own research kindly. I simply think ETH is too expensive and I'm sticking with that thesis. Over time, blockchain fees inevitably and inexorably must come down and they will come down because the Invisible Hand and Adam Smith, even after all this time, still have extreme relevance. And I don't care if you're making pancakes or selling distributed ledger technology; the laws of economics remain very much the same.

Don't get me wrong. ETH has an amazing monopoly or something very close to it. (Random thought: how soon until anti-trust laws kick in with this in mind. At some point, in theory, they could - but who would you sue?) But truly, the volumes and fees and traffic draws in more than anything in the rest of the blockchain industry combined. My colleague Michael Nadeau has written many lovely treatises on the subject because he is an expert in data and facts in this space. For my part, I just keep thinking, over time, there must be competition. I know it's a trite analogy but Betamax had a great thing, until it didn't. Anyone here remember Blockbuster? I know you won't believe me but I actually had to Google the name of that movie-renting store; I actually couldn't immediately remember it. 

FWIW,  I hardly am suggesting ETH will die. But in the same way that Coke ruled soft drinks and beverages for decades, I see no reason chains like Solana, Chainlink, Accumulate, Avalanche, and Polygon, to name a few, can't bite at the ankles of Coca Cola long enough and with such precision so as to make a new name and opportunity for themselves like Gatorade, Prime, Body Armor, Dr. Pepper and Sprite eventually once did. 

Soda pop and blockchain and classic economics; that's all I've got for you today, folks.  To view or add a comment, sign in Senior Fintech Executive. Former bond trader. Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Namibia) Made my way with my son to mass at Saint Peter and Paul's Catholic Church because, well why wouldn't we. This is Cleveland Browns country. I've seen churches and basilicas all over the world, especially in Rome and Italy. Yet it's remarkable the artwork and painting you'll find in some of these otherwise unnoticeable places of worship you'll stumble upon if you crack open the big doors out front, and simply right walk in. For Prodigal's Son's like us, the entry way always remains wide and fully arms open.

What's the old Woody Allen line about how 90% of life is about just showing up.

Hey, by the way, did anyone else get a chance last night to stay up and watch the three-point shootout between Steph and Sabrina. All I can say is she 100% had the greatest shooter of all time on the absolute ropes. But he came through proving once again his undeniably the best ever. As for her, what else can you say but woman's sports and the legacy of Title IX takes one further tiny step forward as the goal towards greater societal equality marches on.

As for the mass, we encountered some 40-45 other steadfast parishioners. The two youngest attendees, besides my son and I, were the two altar boys, who were probably ten. This is an old Polish neighborhood from what I can gather and even has been conjoined with what was once Saint Theresa's parish. The gospel this morning from the First Sunday of Lent is about Jesus setting off into the wilderness with wild beasts. It's a most famous scripture and a beautiful one. 

This President's Day weekend, let's all pray for peace. From every and all religion. The world and our country needs peacemakers. The priest - during his annual appeal - said ""I assume everyone here at this mass is from Ohio"". My little boy graciously raised his right hand. The priest smiled.

We're in Ohio. Man, the hoops here is off the charts. I thought Chicago was the pinnacle; after seeing a 6'3"" Somalian 11-year old block 14 shots with his elbow, I'm no longer so sure.

You need the time off. The respite. I do. We all do.

I'll tell you my favorite thing that happened on this trip so far. It has nothing at all to do with hoops.

So, we're driving kinda late last night and it turns into a mini blizzard, and I've got like 359 miles to go, and it's freezing. And, no - fortunately - I didn't run out of gas.

Coolant light comes on. 

I start Googling, ""Low on coolant"", as I'm slip, sliding down the highway wondering: ""Do I pull over? Turn back? Is my engine toast?""

Next day - today - I sneak out early of hoops and find a Valvoline shop. I'm parked in line thinking, ""I'm screwed - they'll see the Illinois plates and this may turn into a second mortgage."" 

Why does all this stuff keep happening to me, I wonder, as a pipe just burst above us in Room 132 at the Double Tree in Independence. (Hockey teen fell asleep in the shower; he's OK. My quarters are drenched.)

Back to the coolant saga: kid opens the gate. Let's me in. I have no idea what to expect. 

He pops the hood and deposits some goop into the engine of my car. Tells me to pull outside. I'm like: ""Oh no.""

I go: ""So what's next?""

He says: ""You're good to go.""

Baffled, I'm like: ""What do I owe you?""

He's real calm: ""Nothing.""

And at that moment, my confidence in humanity gets a big, friendly Buckeye boost. I slip him a twenty and tell him to enjoy lunch. He laughs and goes: ""Thanks, man.""

I cut him off and go: ""No, no - thank you.""

An attorney, Mr. Navalny was a vociferous critic and opponent of Vladimir Putin, and now he is longer alive.

Russia is most certainly not a democracy even though for unknown reasons they host elections from time to time. Unambiguously, the country is a dictatorship and all dissent is stifled within the country by both media control and military muscle. 

Some 400,000 or thereabouts young and old Russians have been sent to their death in the blitzkrieg of Ukraine, and this is seen as perfectly normal in a county bereft of consciousness after decades, centuries even, of internal subjugation.

In places like India, South Africa, and even the United States we saw brave individuals like Ghandi, Mandela, and King fight for justice and risk or give their lives in the name of freedom. 

In Russia, there is no voice of reason and there is no hope for peace. It's a dangerous country run by a delusional, out-of-touch lunatic sitting on millions of nuclear missiles. I can't think of a bigger risk to global stability than Russia and Putin, and I pray that someday he is unseated and his nation and her brilliant people can be reseated at the table of free, law-respecting nations.

We all like public spaces. The only question is who pays for them. Who gets to use them and when. And, in this particular instance, who gets the distinct privilege of cleaning them up (and paying for that, too.)

All over the park district, there are signs everywhere that read: ""No dogs allowed"", and all winter long dogs run amok doing what dogs do: ripping grass out, digging holes, and creating general disarray. 

It's funny, too, because like 150 feet from the actual baseball diamonds there is this other quaint, charming area. You won't believe what you'll find in this safe, clean, fenced in spot. Why; that's a living, breathing real-life dog park, isn't it?

Well, for months, even years, the dog owners and kids' coaches went round and round. Finally, some genius in construction and other wiseman who knows all the cops and aldermen said, ""We have a solution.""

And presto, despite lots of online complaining and overall testiness by some neighbors, and interim solution is found. Enforced. ""Fence it off!""

And despite the howls of protests, some bring early morning coolers to celebrate the transition while others sulk. Either way, in about ten weeks, you'll see a bunch of six-year olds running around the Friendly, Spotless Confines with another phrase top of mind: ""Play Ball"".

Somewhere, Pony Boy is quietly, desperately weeping. Figuring. To view or add a comment, sign in Senior Fintech Executive. Former bond trader. Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Namibia) What would you rather own? A.) All the shares of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse? Or B.)....all the Tether and Binance Coin in the world?

If you sense a trick question here, you win a prize.

A.) Market Cap @$140 B
B.) ""Market Cap"" @$148 B

Coinbase did that smart ad recently talking about how 2/3 of all pennies are no longer in usage in our economy because 120 million gold-plated one centers get lost each year while Tether did like $7 trillion in transactions in 2023 or some crazy number like that. 

There's this living, breathing epic transition happening right before our eyes and the MSM barely recognizes, pretends to ignore it and mostly now keeps silent on it. ""But just you wait until the next perp walk - because you know it's coming!!"" 

In the meantime, BTC is jamming higher, and so too, is ETH. And on top of that coins 3-1000 and even into the thousands are generally riding along in the catbird seat looking to fly into the stratosphere. 

The whole industry is ""only"" two trillion dollars while MSFT is now 3. Hard to know what to do with that spread trade, if anything. Nvidia = $1.8 if that's any further help. Who ever came up with the term ""Software is Eating the World"" (and I think the answer might have been Marc Andreessen) probably made the call of the century when those words were first spoken, and if you look all you mostly see is the carnage and wreckage of many financial institutions who barely made it. Don't get me wrong; there are still stalwarts. Like Goldman Sachs: market cap - $123 B; Blackstone - $157 B; and Blackrock  - $116 N. Add it all up and what does it mean (or total)? Some @$400 B. 

What is the Ethereum market cap + Solana + a player to be named later (let's throw in PolkaDot)? 

Answer: if you guessed ""Virtually the exact same as the Goldman, Blackrock, Blackstone parlay"", you win a second prize. 

These numbers. It's like they play tricks on you.

Look at these names using their Spruce subnet - Citi The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) Wellington Management WisdomTree Asset Management.

It's a veritable Who's Who of Wall Street and some of the largest and most important financial institutions in the world. And they all have a common need: a third-party audit trail for trusted information. It's really that simple.

More to the point, the target market where this all matters in this particular context is private market assets. From the release: ""Private markets, although a $10 trillion asset class, are characterized by an infrastructure that is complex and manual, with a lack of standardization and transparency, leading to inefficient distribution and operations. There are often complex legal and regulatory restrictions related to private assets.""

Enter these players to solve that problem. And to take a $10 trillion asset class to a wider distribution network, and to do so in a legally, compliant manner. At scale. Boom.

________________________________________________________________

I drew a line there for a reason. This is the Editor's Notes section. 

I see a lot of well-intended, good people kvetching non-stop about BTC as the indispensable, Only One. I simply don't see it that way. As great as the bitcoin network is, there is reason - there are actually lots of reasons - Citi and others didn't build on BTC to solve this problem. No offense to BTC, but it doesn't have the same infrastructure AVA has and it isn't built to solve the same problem. Other chains besides Ethereum, another contender, create solutions not found elsewhere. That's why there's almost a certain inevitability to competing chains like Polygon, Chainlink, Solana, Accumulate, Provenance, and literally dozens if not hundreds of others. We know there will be winners and losers. And consolidation. But there also won't ever be a world with just BTC and ETH, either. And at least not in my view. This story demonstrates that. And if you think this partnership is a one off, well then, as my Dad used to say, ""I've got a bridge to sell you - in my backyard."" Senior Director of BD for Institutions & Capital Markets at Ava Labs After launching Avalanche Spruce, an Evergreen Subnet built for buy- and sell-side Financial Services Institutions to explore on-chain finance, today marks a major update as Citi and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) Digital Assets join the network and test the benefits of private market tokenization with key asset managers Wellington Management and WisdomTree.

Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Namibia) In what might be the coolest thing ever, these two - Steph Curry and Sabrina Ionescu - are set to face off in a legitimate 3-point shooting contest at the upcoming NBA All-Star weekend.

Now, I know what all you casual bad hoopers and smart alecks are probably thinking: ""Yeah, but Mike; WNBA players shoot from a closer 3-point line so it's not even apples to apples, now, is it??""

Answer: Incorrect. 

Ms. Ionescu has already insisted on shooting from the same distance ""because that's where I practice from and shoot from in games, anyways.""

In case you're wondering: she can really shoot. In fact, she made 37/40 points one time going around the world while Steph has only maxed out at 31/40, a stat that seems both mind boggling and terribly enticing for Vegas oddsmakers.

I hope she wins, gosh darnit. And I absolutely love Steph. He is in my troika with MJ and Mahomes. Just love the guy. 

This won't be no Billy Jean King - Bobby Riggs faux competition. And no offense to the great Ms. King. That match was a ploy. This shooting competition will show us who is the best in the world at deep shooting in a practice setting. My money, if I were to bet, is on her. Caitlin Clark is another hooper who could rise to this occasion someday. It's great to see so many female athletes changing the sport of basketball.

Gotta give a shout out to my former Fenwick classmate Rich Excell CFA, CMT, who's been dubious on softer prices heading into 2024. The end result as it pertains to markets today is stocks are sharply lower and bond yields are significantly higher than yesterday. There were unconfirmed, random Tweets on X the White House is in a ""panic"" over the fact the Federal Reserve may not be able ease the cost of money like investors were previously hoping for. In short, a tough day and time for a sentiment reset overall, even though there is plenty of time before this year draws to a close.

Crypto is also lower but highly volatile both ways of late. I see lots of red on my phone apps but this is also after a couple days of impressive gains. BTC is just below $50k as I write this and ETH is above $2,600, and these are prices not too many bulls would've minded last week, so you just keep a watchful eye and see how things unfold. The bitcoin halving, for what it's worth, is in like 10-12 weeks. Right around the corner, in other words.

The inflation data is unsettling, to revisit the earlier discussion. We have had so little inflation for so long that, frankly, even the top banks and academics and economists in the world don't have enough data to properly forecast how things will transpire. That's my own personal view, and others may disagree with how I see things. The fact of the matter is markets need to be convinced. They want to see the ""whites of their eyes"", as Burt used to say. And, right now, things are hazy and cloudy at best.  To view or add a comment, sign in 39,749 followers LINKEDIN Never miss a beat on the app Don‚Äôt have the app? Get it in the Microsoft Store.

The summit is gathering the most influential people focused on public policy for digital asset and blockchain innovations, according to the organizers. , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- MicroStrategy Inc. Chief Executive Michael Saylor told investors not to worry about a potential margin call on a Bitcoin-backed loan, saying the company has ample collateral to pledge if necessary.  ‚ÄúAs long as the Silvergate loan remains collateralized with an LTV less than 50%, there is no margin call,‚Äù Saylor wrote in a email to Bloomberg, referring to loan-to-value metrics. ‚ÄúWe manage accordingly.‚Äù The software firm said on a conference call in May that the price of the Bitcoin would need to fall to around $21,000 before a call would be triggered on its $205 million loan from a unit of Silvergate Bank, but that it may contribute more to the collateral package so it never gets there. Bitcoin was trading around $22,500 Tuesday after dipping as low as $20,800 earlier in the session. ‚ÄúWhen @MicroStrategy adopted a #Bitcoin Strategy, it anticipated volatility and structured its balance sheet so that it could continue to #HODL through adversity,‚Äù Saylor tweeted earlier in the day. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer also said the company should have plenty of Bitcoin to meet any margin call as the firm has more than 95,000 Bitcoins to post as collateral. The firm is required to maintain a loan-to-collateral ratio of 50% or less and has at least $410 million worth of Bitcoin in a custody account. ‚ÄúThere is no liquidation provision here,‚Äù Palmer said in a phone interview, also noting there is a ‚Äúvast amount of confusion‚Äù over the loan agreement.  The company has about $2.2 billion in debt, roughly $44 million in annual interest expenses and is expected to generate $90 million of free cash flow in 2022, Palmer added. MicroStrategy‚Äôs 6.125% notes due in 2028 last traded at about 80 cents on the dollar, according to Trace bond trading data.

,,How Did Michael Saylor Make His Money?,"Michael Saylor is a software developer and Bitcoin investor worth $1.8 billion. Although he originally wanted to become a pilot, a health condition forced him to change his goal. He applied his deep understanding of mathematics to create business intelligence products with predictive features. More recently, he has become a noteworthy Bitcoin investor who probably ranks among the cryptocurrency‚Äôs top 10 owners. Michael Saylor studied aeronautics and technology at MIT with hopes of becoming a pilot. A medical condition prevented him from reaching that dream, so he accepted a job offer from The National Group. At the consulting firm, he focused on building computer simulations that predicted outcomes. A year after joining The National Group, he became an internal consultant with DuPont. While at DuPont, he developed predictive models that anticipated downturns in some areas of the chemical company‚Äôs sectors. This initial success helped save DuPont countless dollars and established Saylor as an effective consultant.  Saylor worked with DuPont for four years before he had enough money to start his own business independent of The National Group. He reached out to Sanju Bansal, a fraternity brother whose work he had admired at MIT. Together, they co-founded MicroStrategy and started building business intelligence software. People often say that Michael Saylor worked at McDonald‚Äôs, but this is only partially true. Really, he worked with his team at MicroStrategy to build software solutions for the fast food giant. McDonald‚Äôs became MicroStrategy‚Äôs first major client in 1992 when it awarded a $10 million contract to the startup. MicroStrategy‚Äôs success with data mining and analytics earned it a positive reputation that led to several years of rapid growth. Saylor had an impressive career years before he started investing in Bitcoin seriously. His work creating innovative business intelligence solutions earned him awards from MIT Technology Review and other prestigious organizations. Saylor spent three decades as MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO. During that time, he took the company public and attracted major investors that helped build out its business intelligence solutions. Each release anticipated the growing digital needs of businesses. Saylor also had to contend with some emergencies during his term as CEO. The SEC reviewed MicroStrategy‚Äôs accounting processes and found discrepancies that led to a million-dollar fine. MicroStrategy never admitted to any wrongdoing, but it agreed to have a third party handle its accounting needs. Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy with two friends in 1989. Saylor served as the company‚Äôs CEO until 2022, when Phong Lee took the position. Saylor said that leaving the role would give him more time to concentrate on studying Bitcoin as an investment opportunity. During Saylor‚Äôs tenure as CEO, MicroStrategy released at least 13 business intelligence software solutions. MicroStrategy 2020 includes a revamped version of the software‚Äôs Hyperintelligence analytics tool. Saylor oversaw several important tasks as MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO. He acquired and sold several smaller businesses. He established fruitful connections with venture capitalists. He also took the company public. As his interest in Bitcoin grew, though, he wanted to give someone else oversight of the company‚Äôs operations. Michael Saylor made his money as co-founder and CEO of Microstrategy, and subsequently as a bitcoin investor. MicroStrategy invested $250 million in Bitcoin. Saylor has continued to buy more Bitcoin since. In November 2023, the company acquired 16,130 coins. It‚Äôs portfolio now includes 174,530 Bitcoin. Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility made investors worry that MicroStrategy would need to sell some of its coins as the value fell to $20,000. The company had enough cash reserves that it could hold its investment, though. The strategy paid off as Bitcoin has since reached $44,000. Bitcoin investing needs a strategy that accounts for the assets‚Äô volatility. During the 2022 crash, Bitcoin‚Äôs value fell from $69,000 to below $19,000. Why didn‚Äôt Saylor‚Äôs predictive analytics see the crash coming? After all, it‚Äôs a volatile currency with a history of sharp ups and downs. Unfortunately, Saylor probably couldn‚Äôt have predicted the fall because FTX declared bankruptcy after its founder committed fraud. No one could have known the company was hiding information. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, was arrested on securities fraud and wire fraud charges. Bitcoin investors lost confidence and sold their coins. As with any asset, the sudden surge in sales forced Bitcoin‚Äôs value down. Saylor lost about $1.3 billion in the crash. However, he was able to retain ownership of his coins instead of selling them to avoid further losses. Keeping the coins positioned Saylor and MicroStrategy for a comeback as Bitcoin‚Äôs value rebounded. Blockchains use anonymous addresses that make it hard to know who owns Bitcoin. Someone can also use multiple blockchain addresses, which makes research even more challenging. Some research and analysis firms think they have an answer. Many say Bitcoin‚Äôs creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has the most Bitcoin. If true, Nakamoto likely owns 1.1 million BTC spread over 22,000 addresses. Saying Satoshi Nakamoto owns the most Bitcoin raises other questions, though. The biggest problem is that no one knows who Nakamoto is. The name probably represents a group of technology developers that created Bitcoin and blockchain databases in the late 2000s. As Bitcoin‚Äôs creators, the person or persons behind Nakamoto had opportunities to buy coins from the beginning, meaning they could purchase whole coins for pennies. Regardless of who or what Nakamoto is, they‚Äôre universally regarded as the largest Bitcoin investor. Saylor thinks Bitcoin‚Äôs value will skyrocket before the end of 2024. Sure, that‚Äôs a bullish position, but he has reasons to believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs investment potential. Bitcoin caps the number of coins that can exist. This feature means that coins become harder and more expensive to mine over time. Saylor believes that the dwindling supply and high mining costs will force Bitcoin miners to start selling more of their coins. When this happens, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity will encourage investors to buy. Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin prediction depends on serious people taking over the industry. He believes reliable companies like MicroStrategy need to become the industry‚Äôs leaders instead of letting young, idealistic people like Bankman-Fried undermine Bitcoin‚Äôs future. As he put it, ‚Äúthe adults‚Äù need to take over and replace less serious people without business experience. There are good reasons to believe more mature, grounded influencers would benefit Bitcoin‚Äôs future as an investment asset. Bankman-Fried famously contended that FTX didn‚Äôt need a CFO because he knew where the money was, making the CFO position irrelevant. A more rational approach would apply sound business principles to Bitcoin instead of trusting eccentric individuals to lead the way. Is Saylor correct about Bitcoin‚Äôs potential? Only the market can say for sure. Although FTX scared investors, it also brought Bitcoin back into media headlines, which could rejuvenate interest in the crypto asset. If that happens, the market could find a new group of users. As they invest, Bitcoin‚Äôs value should grow and Saylor will become even wealthier. When Financhill publishes its #1 stock, listen up.

,,A Conversation on Crypto with Michael Saylor,"Cathy Merrill: Thank you all for joining us. We‚Äôre going to get going here in just a minute as we wait for everyone to come into the session. So thank you. Okay. I see the numbers are still climbing, but I also know that the numbers lag from when people actually come on. So we‚Äôre going to get started because we have a lot to talk about today. Hello. I am Cathy Merrill, I am the CEO of Washingtonian Magazine. Welcome. With me today is Michael Saylor. He is the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, which is a company right here in Washington, DC that is a terrific company that focuses on enterprise analytics and software helping a lot of other companies. He grew up in a military family. He lived on various air force bases around the country. He attended MIT where he got a dual degree in aeronautics and astronautics, that was one degree, as well as in science technology and society. He graduated with the highest honors while completing flight officer school and out of college joined the air force. At the age of 24, he founded MicroStrategy which went public in 1998. He holds more than 40 patents and is a best selling author. Welcome Michael. Michael Saylor: Thanks for having me Cathy. Cathy Merrill: Today we‚Äôre going to be talking to you about crypto as I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôm going to give a little facts that you know very well, but 20% of American adults own crypto at this point. The crypto market is valued at about 1.75 trillion, which is roughly the size of Google. The biggest player in that market is Bitcoin, which on its own would be I think the 11th largest currency in the world. You own 125,000 Bitcoins or about $5.5 billion worth, so you are the largest holder in the world. Michael Saylor: As of yesterday, we have 129,000. We announced we bought 4,000 more. Cathy Merrill: Oh, okay. I‚Äôm a little behind. Michael Saylor: You can‚Äôt can‚Äôt stop buying Bitcoin Cathy. Cathy Merrill: Cannot stop buying. Well, that‚Äôs what everyone wants to talk about. As you and I discussed, there‚Äôs a lot of questions. We‚Äôre going to try to do them rapidly so we can get through as many as we can. Let me start with a basic question. Somewhere in January of 2009, someone took some code, they broke it into 21 million bits and called it Bitcoin. They‚Äôll never be more than 21 million of these bits. They‚Äôre now each worth about $44,000. Is it a currency or is it a commodity? How do you think about it? Michael Saylor: I think the best way to think of it is digital property. Also, you could think of it as the world‚Äôs first digital commodity. The idea behind Bitcoin is to create perfect money or another way to think of it is create perfect gold. If I could take the entire supply of gold, like 6 billion ounces or whatever it is, and if I could reduce it to 21 million gold coins and then if I could dematerialize them so that they‚Äôre weightless and magically I could move them at the speed of light and compose and decompose them. If I could split them into 100 million little elements we call Satoshi and then I could store them in cyberspace. And if I could find an incorruptible software program that would keep track of who owns the 21 million virtual coins, then you would have Bitcoin. And so the idea a Bitcoin is we put our money in cyberspace, we put computers in charge, software programs in charge, but then we distribute the software program so it runs on hundreds of thousands of different computers and every computer has a copy of the same program and the same ledger so that nobody can cheat anybody and any of the nodes that get corrupted get thrown off the network. So it‚Äôs a living creature distributed in cyber space. And the purpose is to create a shared immutable ledger of who owns what. And that‚Äôs been a- Cathy Merrill: It‚Äôs like a giant Google drive spreadsheet, but every time someone touches it, you know who touch. Everyone can see who touched it, right? Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs right. And so the whole idea is you can‚Äôt mine anymore gold, it‚Äôs just capped to 21 million and you don‚Äôt have to worry about some central bank or some custodian taking your gold and selling it to someone else and you don‚Äôt know, and nobody can seize it. And the ownership of the Bitcoin is through the possession of private keys. So you can in theory own any amount of it, $10,000, $10 billion. And if you convey the private keys to someone else on the network, then the ownership moves to them away from you. And so for the first time, we‚Äôve got immortal money that can move at the speed of light and can be programmed on a computer. That‚Äôs the big idea. Cathy Merrill: So let‚Äôs talk about the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are now over 10,000 cryptocurrencies, some of which can be flooded the way potentially the gold market could be flooded because we could find a new gold mine vein tomorrow and not know that it exists. Are the other cryptocurrencies fundamentally different than Bitcoin in that way? Are they the same? Michael Saylor: Bitcoin is the world‚Äôs first engineered monetary system. And so the protocol is meant to do one thing really well, keep track of who owns everything forever without breaking in a secure fashion. The other cryptos, some of them pursued something similar, but a lot of them pursue other objectives. They want to be crypto platforms for building smart contracts or issuing NFTs, or they want to run decentralized exchanges. And these are all different missions and they generally end up with a lot more complicated code and different and types of code. If you think about creating life and cyberspace, my idea of life is a virus or a plankton or bacteria, but there‚Äôs someone else that comes up with an idea of life like a flying eagle. Okay. So is an Eagle life? Yeah, but is it like a swarm of hornets and is it like bacteria? No, it‚Äôs a different life. So Bitcoin is engineered to be this base layer of the entire economy, the monetary network. And the thing that‚Äôs unique about it is that it‚Äôs been copied hundreds, thousands of times. And there have been 20,000 different cryptos that have been launched. The issue is which one is best suited to be the fundamental technical, ethical base layer of the cyber economy. And you didn‚Äôt know for 12 years. You only know after you‚Äôve attacked it 25,000 times and copied it 25,000 times, they‚Äôve all failed or they‚Äôre all different. It‚Äôs like, if I release bunny rabbits into Australia and they fill up this niche in the ecosystem, the small furry mammal. Okay, will it work? You don‚Äôt know, but after a hundred years, if bunny rabbits dominate that niche, then they own that niche and they have that part of the food chain. So Bitcoin today is the winner of this global struggle to see what will be the dominant digital monetary asset in the world. And what makes it unique is it‚Äôs the strongest, it has the most energy, it is the strongest network, it is the most capital, it has the most support, it‚Äôs the most robust protocol, it‚Äôs the most unbreakable one, it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs been tested the longest, the most indestructible one, and of course the most well known one. It‚Äôs like the Coca-Cola of digital money and so you‚Äôve got the strongest brand. Cathy Merrill: So someone wrote in and asked if you owned other cryptocurrencies. And so it sounds like, no, but is that true or do you own them? Michael Saylor: No, I don‚Äôt own any others. I think the Bitcoin is unique. I mean, Bitcoin is a property. It‚Äôs like buying a block of Manhattan in cyberspace. Cyber Manhattan, it‚Äôs like Manhattan. And there‚Äôs a million people that want to launch other cities. I have another idea for a city, but it‚Äôs not Manhattan. So the risk of owning anything else is orders of magnitude higher. The return is orders of magnitude lower. I would liken all the other cryptos, they‚Äôre like investing in small startups, right? Like there‚Äôs Apple computer and then my cousin has an idea for a mobile app that‚Äôs to compete with Instagram. So there‚Äôs like 100,000 mobile apps launched and 99.9% of them all fail and then one of them will be WhatsApp or Instagram and Snapchat. So you might get a Snapchat, but you‚Äôll probably get one of the losers. And it‚Äôs not the same as investing in Apple stock, which is like holding the broad based index of all mobile functionality. So Bitcoin is the risk off asset in the space, right? It‚Äôs the most certain thing. Everything else is a risk on asset that has more security risk. You have to analyze it, there‚Äôs more competition, there‚Äôs more complexity, there‚Äôs more regulatory risk. And if you‚Äôre a specialist like a venture capitalist and you want to basically spend your full time analyzing the space, maybe you can invest in that space. But if any ordinary person said, ‚ÄúOkay, well I‚Äôm 60. I want to retire. How do I allocate my assets?‚Äù It‚Äôs like you some land, maybe in the S&P index you own a little bit of stock portfolio. And then if you want to own a digital property, Bitcoin is the risk off digital property, own some of that. And I‚Äôm not going to tell you to go investing in small startups. Cathy Merrill: Yeah. So for someone listening here who‚Äôs got a sizable 401k, maybe they‚Äôve saved, they‚Äôve owned their house, they maybe own some one off stocks that they‚Äôve picked themselves outside their 401k, maybe they own a little bit of gold. Where does in your world, Bitcoin or crypto fall into that? Is it like a little bit of gold or you would convert a lot of your 401k to it or? Michael Saylor: Bitcoin‚Äôs property. Cathy Merrill: About $5 billion. Michael Saylor: Yeah. So let‚Äôs just talk about why would you want to own property. If the money supply is expanding at 7% a year and you own property and it‚Äôs scarce and desirable, your property will probably go up in value 7% a year. And that‚Äôs the history of property for the past 100 years. So when you get to a point where you want to be invested, if you have money you want to save and give to your grandchildren, the least risky thing to do is put it in a scarce desirable property that some affluent intelligent person will want to buy from you in 30 years or 100 years. So Bitcoin fits that bucket and it competes with owning a building or owning a‚Ä¶ If you wanted to have a second rental home, you would buy a second home and you would Airbnb it or you would rent it. And the benefit of that is you‚Äôre invested in property and you can maybe put a mortgage on it so you can leverage it up. And then the detriment is you got to maintain the home and storm might hit it. And then if nobody rents it from you or they trash it. Maybe you can‚Äôt rent it at certain points in time if it‚Äôs in the wrong place. So what if I could snap my fingers and convert your rental Airbnb apartment into a Bitcoin, I call it a digital virtual apartment. And then if I told you it could last forever, you don‚Äôt have to repaint it and then you can teleport it to place in the world where anybody needs it for the Japanese Olympics or you can move it to the Cannes Film Festival and you find the highest bidder. And then when they don‚Äôt want anymore, you bring it back and you teleport it to New York or Paris or London. So think of it as like your digital apartment that you can put a mortgage on and that you can rent out to the highest that you can also carry around in the palm of your hand and hold on an Android or an iPhone. Now, ask yourself the question, how much of your portfolio do you want to invested in that kind of property? And then maybe you want to invest in Facebook or Apple, or you want to invest in a stock because you like that or maybe you want to speculate or gamble your money. So you go gamble some money and then you have some money in a checking account because you got to pay your bills in the next 90 days. And so you divide your money that way. The checking account‚Äôs least risky. The property is a little bit of risk but not nearly as risky as investments in stocks. And then of course the speculations, the meme coins or the meme stocks or the gambling on the horse, that‚Äôs very risky. And of course, one more point to make is the problem with holding a million dollars of cash in a bank is that it has been losing 7% of its value a year for a hundred years, but it‚Äôs losing about 14 to 21% of its value now. So you‚Äôre guaranteed to lose 90% of the money you have in the bank over a decade in an inflationary environment. So that‚Äôs a built in risk, it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb. So that drives you to say, ‚ÄúWell, I got to put it in property or I got to put it in investment or I got to gamble it.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what I would say to an individual. Cathy Merrill: Thank you. For those that don‚Äôt follow that math. You‚Äôre saying the currency, especially with inflation right now is in decline. The dollar is worth less than it was worth 100 ago. Michael Saylor: Yeah. Let‚Äôs talk about the issue of inflation. It‚Äôs very important, incredibly important. The house that I live in right now is 305 times more expensive than it was in 1930, 305. That means that the dollar has lost 99.7% of its value in 90 years. Now if you back calculate that implies that the actual inflation rate of the currency has been about six and a half to 7% a year for 100 years. If you‚Äôre calculating the rate at which things you want to buy go up in price, the real inflation rate for a hundred years is 7%. The government published inflation rate is 2%. The difference is the government‚Äôs tracking a consumer basket of goods and they make hedonic adjustments. So they‚Äôre telling you that you should be happy in an 800 square foot apartment made of drywall watching Netflix and Netflix hasn‚Äôt gone up. But 30 years ago, they would actually calculate the price of a bigger apartment or the price to buy, but they don‚Äôt do that anymore. And they‚Äôre not calculating the cost to buy assets. So if you want to buy something like a house on the beach, well, housing went up in price 20% year over year, 19.2% according to Case‚ÄìShiller index. And yet the government says that the CPI is only up 7.9%. So the inflation rate if you already own a house or if you don‚Äôt want to buy a house and you live in your parents‚Äô basement is 7.9%. But the inflation rate if you‚Äôre a first time home buyer is 19.2%. So if you calculate, if you consider the rate at which the money is losing value, the answer you come to is the United States dollars lost 99.7% of its value. It will lose 99.9% of its value over 100 years and every other currency loses 100% of its value over 100 years. And your only hope to preserve your wealth is to convert that currency into a property. If you convert it into a house, you got a 305 X return on your money, right? So just buy a house. But what‚Äôs the problem with that? The problem with that is that Florida taxes housing and real estate at 2% a year. So if I convert a million dollars of cash into a million dollar house, I have to come up with $20,000 a year and I lose the house in 50 years. And that‚Äôs assuming they don‚Äôt reappraise the house up, but of course they will. So in fact, if you convert a million dollars of cash into a house in Florida, you‚Äôll lose all the money in about 30 years. So that means I got to go and I got to risk the million dollars by betting on a company, or I got to gamble the million dollars. Why? Because there‚Äôs no perfected money that I could just convert the cash into. Well, Bitcoin is the first example of an asset where you simply convert a million in currency into a million dollars of Bitcoin. And then because you can‚Äôt make any more Bitcoin, Bitcoin price appreciates at the rate of inflation and it also appreciates with adoption and it also appreciates with technology advance. So people that are buying Bitcoin are saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to gamble in the market, I don‚Äôt want to gamble on meme coins. I‚Äôm sick and tired of being taxed to death on my real estate. The government is already confiscating and seizing all my property via tax and via a sanction. So what I want is property in cyberspace I can hold in my head, carry around in my hand that no one‚Äôs going to take away from me and they‚Äôre going to not going to de base. And then I‚Äôll just hold that for my life.‚Äù Cathy Merrill: What do you say to the people that are scared about the regulation that‚Äôs coming in and they don‚Äôt understand the tax implications? Most of the banks won‚Äôt touch it. Merrill Lynch is like, ‚ÄúWell, we are not you‚Äôre a client. We don‚Äôt deal with that.‚Äù Michael Saylor: Yeah. So the regulation that‚Äôs coming is- Cathy Merrill: That‚Äôs true of Morgan Stanley, Goldman, everywhere. I mean, you know that. Michael Saylor: The regulation that‚Äôs coming is going to be really good for Bitcoin and it‚Äôs good for digital property adoption because it‚Äôs going to create bright lines that cause an avalanche of institutional money to come into this space and buy the asset. So the regulation is good. The tax treatment is set by the IRS in 2014, it‚Äôs just property and if you sell it at a capital gain, you owe capital gains, either long term or short term capital gains. So that‚Äôs not really misunderstood. What you want to do is you want to buy it and hold it for as long as you can. And if you need money, you borrow against the asset and that way you don‚Äôt pay the capital gains tax ever. But if you do sell it or transfer it, you owe capital gains tax. With regard to the big bulge bracket banks, 24 months ago Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi Group, they wouldn‚Äôt touch it, but they wouldn‚Äôt even talk about it. In the last 24 months. Every one of those banks has started covering it. They have analysts publishing every week and they have embraced it. The head of JP Morgan four years ago said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it. You‚Äôll get fired if you use it.‚Äù But this year said, ‚ÄúOkay, I don‚Äôt quite understand it, but my customers want it, so we‚Äôll sell it to them.‚Äù The head of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon said the same thing. The previous head- Cathy Merrill: Janet Yellen said last week that she thought it was the future. I mean, she didn‚Äôt say it was the future, she said‚Ä¶ Michael Saylor: She kind of said it is the future. But maybe a more important opinion was Joe Biden‚Äôs opinion because the White House issued an executive order a few weeks ago. And in that executive order it said, ‚ÄúWhereas 40 million Americans have crypto assets and they think it‚Äôs the future, I hear by direct all the government agencies to figure out how to responsibly regulate it and incorporate it into our government.‚Äù So in essence what you‚Äôve got is when Biden was elected, Biden brought a bunch of progressive regulators, Janet Yellen and Gary Gensler, and they kept Jerome Powell. All three of them are on record as saying, ‚ÄúThis is a digital asset. It may be speculative, but it‚Äôs not going away. And we understand why people would want it. It doesn‚Äôt compete with the dollar. We‚Äôre not going to ban it. We are going to embrace it. You have to pay your taxes on it. If you transfer a billion dollars secretly, you‚Äôre going to have to disclose it.‚Äù They‚Äôll apply all the standard anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing, tax code to it because that‚Äôs what an adult would do with regard to a new technology. But there‚Äôs no political interest in banning Bitcoin or holding it back at the administration level. And there‚Äôs profound enthusiastic support for it in the Senate and in Congress. And I actually think that the regulators and the administration are also very enthusiastically embracing it. Because Cathy, in the last 100 years, when did the White House ever issue an executive order legitimizing a new asset class telling everybody to figure it out? Cathy Merrill: Yeah, that‚Äôs a big deal. Michael Saylor: Right? I mean, that‚Äôs really a first. It‚Äôs certainly a first this century. The last time we invented a new asset class, 30, 40, 50 years ago, maybe a commodity index. The equivalent would really be like the Vanguard 500 or the S&P index like John Bogle saying you should just buy an index of stocks. It‚Äôs more profound than that in some ways, but it‚Äôs a similar idea that you just got to get comfortable with. Cathy Merrill: Well, I think they also know that almost all ransomware payments now are done in Bitcoin. That‚Äôs what they want because it can travel without people seeing it. Michael Saylor: Actually the truth is there‚Äôs 17,000 cryptos, but some of them are specifically for moving money without anybody knowing and those get a lot more heat from law enforcement. Bitcoin is a public ledger. So if I send you $100, everybody in the world knows that it went from my wallet to yours. I mean, it‚Äôs completely transparent. Not only can you look at every transaction in Bitcoin every 10 minutes, you can download the entire software to a $400 device and you would‚Äôve a record of every Bitcoin transaction since the beginning of time, right? It‚Äôs completely transparent. And in the big crypto bust that took place a few weeks ago, I think the law enforcement, the FBI traced $3 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been heisted often in exchange because it is transparent. So you might get some Bitcoin transferred to you, but you can‚Äôt ever spend it because you won‚Äôt be able to liquidate it on the exchanges because they know that it‚Äôs a criminal that has the wallet. And so it‚Äôs not really good for that. You would rather use gold or cash in that situation. Cathy Merrill: When you look at that blockchain of transactions, do you see it growing in the US or abroad and have you seen it moving around Ukraine and that part of the world, because people are trying‚Ä¶ I know my Ukrainian friend, her family can‚Äôt get money out of the ATM there. So do you look at that code in those transactions? Michael Saylor: Well, I mean, you don‚Äôt actually know where the‚Ä¶ For example, if I had a billion dollars and I knew the private key is in my head, I could go anywhere in the world, right? The billion is sitting at an address. You don‚Äôt know where I am and I could send it anywhere in the world. I could actually move it anywhere in the world every second. So the point is the money‚Äôs not some place, the money is in cyberspace, right? It‚Äôs sitting in the ether. So I wouldn‚Äôt think of it like that, but maybe the more interesting question is why is adoption of Bitcoin exploding right now around the world? And the answer is because it solves a problem that people are facing. And if you look at the key things that have happened, the bank system has seized up in the developing world, like in Lebanon and in Turkey and in Afghanistan and Iraq, lots of parts of Africa, lots of parts of South America. Cypress was an example. When the bank freezes, it basically freezes all your assets and then it converts them from whatever the dollars are to local currency and it devalues them. So the first driver is people don‚Äôt trust the banks and they don‚Äôt trust their local currencies. They‚Äôre all collapsing. The second driver is the Canadian trucker crisis traumatized hundreds of millions of people because the message there was, if you‚Äôre an American citizen and if the head of another country Canada disagrees with your politics, he could just seize your money, take it without a court order without due process. So you‚Äôre an American and a Canadian politician just took millions of dollars overnight from you just because he wanted to. So that caused a bunch of P people to think, I can‚Äôt really trust a politician. And if I have the wrong politics, they‚Äôll just take my money, right? Cathy Merrill: Right. People don‚Äôt trust politicians? When did that happen? Michael Saylor: Yeah, it‚Äôs a while. So the third thing was the Ukrainian war. And then all the banks in Ukraine froze and people want to get out of the country or they want to move and they can‚Äôt get any money, right? And then all the Russian banks froze and the Russian market froze. So you‚Äôve got 300 million people with a bank crisis, a currency crisis. When that happened, the Russian currency crashed by 30% and then the Ukrainian, Polish, Hungarian and Turkish currencies all weakened. So everyone in that part of the world lost anywhere from three to 30% of all their wealth and maybe they lost three to 30% for of what they‚Äôre going to have. So that‚Äôs a big panic. Then what happened was the Russian sanctions where the West basically seized 300 billion of gold and currency derivatives from Russia and then they started seizing all the property of all the Russian oligarchs. And the mainstream media view is, yeah, we should do that, right? They‚Äôre spoilers of war. But the United States never declared war in Russia. So this is an example of one country not at war with another country where citizens of the one country are having all their property seized by other countries without due process immediately. And so that means that everyone that has any assets anywhere in the world that thinks they might ever be an opposition to any politician anywhere else in the world is feeling very insecure about their property rights. So who might be concerned? Well, you start with the Chinese, they have $3 trillion worth of currency derivatives. So if they invade Taiwan and they lose 3 trillion, or maybe if they just get in a diplomatic dispute over the South China Sea. So then you have the Emiratis and you have all the Middle Easterners and you have all the Africans, you have all the Asians and the Kazakhs and you have all the south Americans, everybody feels insecure about their assets. And so if you feel insecure, who can you trust? And if you can‚Äôt trust your local currency, and if you can‚Äôt trust your local bank and if you‚Äôre building and sports team and boats and company stock is going to be seized because it‚Äôs international and everybody has international somewhere, right? If that‚Äôs the case, then you think what do I do? And the answer is, first of all, I get my money out of the bank. And so I would take my dollars out of the bank and I‚Äôd buy crypto dollars like Tether or some stable coin. And then I want custodianship of it. I want custody, I want to hold it on my own phone, because if you had your money, if you had $10 million in Lebanon before the crisis in the bank, you lost it all. And if you had the $10 million on a crypto device, you‚Äôre still rich, you still have it all. And so people are opting out of the conventional system. And then of course, well, what good is it to own a building in downtown Kiev or Moscow, right? I mean, you can‚Äôt rent the building to anybody, right? Cathy Merrill: And most of the world has phones now, but they don‚Äôt really have access to play in the market. So this is something that somebody in Africa could buy on their phone, right? Michael Saylor: And it gets us to this issue of human rights. If I give $10,000 to someone in Africa and they have to convert it into the local currency, then the $10,000 is going to be worth $500 in a matter of a few years. So I can‚Äôt even give you the money if the currency doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs collapsing. So if you put it in a bank, the bank steals it. But the bank won‚Äôt give you a bank account. I mean, there‚Äôs 3 billion people that can‚Äôt get a bank account even if they had the money. But if they did get the bank account, someone in Africa can‚Äôt very well be buying a diversified portfolio, a big tech stocks that trade on the NASDAQ. You can‚Äôt physically buy it. So if you have some money, tell me, what do you want to own in Africa that you think is higher quality than owning your house in Maryland or Virginia? What do you want to own? Nothing, right? So there‚Äôs nothing you can buy, right? Okay, buy a bar of gold, carry that around and someone with a machine gun shoots you and takes the gold, unless you go through an airport and they just take it. So how do I actually preserve my economic wealth if I‚Äôm one of the three or 4 billion people in these countries where you can‚Äôt trust the currency, you can‚Äôt trust the government, you can‚Äôt trust your neighbor, you can‚Äôt the bank? And the answer is I download an application to an Android phone, and I put some digital dollars like stable coin and I put some Bitcoin, some digital property on it and I don‚Äôt tell anybody to have it. And if I need to flee the country, I could take it with me. If they‚Äôre going to seize my phone, I could just memorize it and I walk out of the country remembering 12 words, and I keep my wealth. And if I live in America and my loved one is in Nigeria and I want to send them money the conventional way, it takes weeks, there‚Äôs a 10% fee, when they go to get it from the bank, someone robs them. On the other hand, I can just put money in a lightning wallet on a Sunday afternoon and in 30 seconds, zap it to them, friction free for nothing. And I cut out the banks and I cut out the robbers and I cut out the crappy currency and the money changers, right? There‚Äôs a reason that Jesus Christ, what is it, when he goes into the temple and he runs out the money changers, right? He‚Äôs like, you guys are ripping off the people. If you live anywhere in the developing world, you‚Äôre probably losing 10% of your money on transfer just in remittance payments. That‚Äôs each time it moves. And then you lose 20, 30% of it a year to inflation, unless you‚Äôre losing 60% a year to inflation. So it‚Äôs a human rights issue. And people that like Bitcoin think this is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people whose life is hopeless without this technology. Cathy Merrill: So I‚Äôm going to go flip to two quick questions, because one question that just came through was about, because you‚Äôre an evangelist for this is what do you recommend the easiest way to purchase Bitcoin is? The wallet is how people buy currency. Do you have a wallet you prefer? And how do you recommend someone who doesn‚Äôt own any buy it? Michael Saylor: Okay. Well the answer to the first question is you would go to a regulated, licensed exchange in the jurisdiction where you preside. So if you‚Äôre in the US, there are well considered exchanges. Fidelity has a digital assets group. Coinbase is probably the best known, for corporations Knighted, and there are other exchanges. You should do your research and decide which one you trust and which service you trust. If you are interested in resources, if you go to hope.com, H-O-P-E, just remember Bitcoin is hope, then we‚Äôve got tons of education. I would say, you should get yourself educated and become a sophisticated consumer and then do your research and find an institution you trust. What‚Äôs the next question? Cathy Merrill: Okay. On mining, because there‚Äôs a lot about this about energy. And China, as you know, banned crypto mining, so now about 35% is done in the United States. And for those people new to this, the mining is when those transactions get added to the block, it‚Äôs a lot of computers that are following it, and those computers take up a lot of energy. Does that bother you? Michael Saylor: No, actually that‚Äôs what makes it immortal and incorruptible. The Bitcoin mining process is the process of taking raw electricity and then encrypting it with the SHA-256 algorithm. So it‚Äôs encrypted energy. You‚Äôre digitally transforming the energy using a semiconductor chip, which we call Bitcoin miner. And traditionally the biggest manufacturer of that hardware were Chinese companies like Bitmain. But Intel just announced last week that they‚Äôre going to be producing Bitcoin miners and a new Bitcoin mining chip. So the way the network works is I buy the Bitcoin miners, I put it in a data center, I feed it electricity. It throws up a wall of encrypted energy to protect your assets from a hostile attack by a hacker or a nation state or a mal factor. If you didn‚Äôt do that, then someone could just come up with acute piece of code, hack the system and steal all of the hundreds of billions of dollars. And if they did that once, that‚Äôs the end of the world. Cathy Merrill: Do you ever think mining will be carbon neutral? Michael Saylor: The most important thing about mining is it‚Äôs the cleanest, most efficient energy use in the world. I mean, this is the cleanest industry in the world. Many people don‚Äôt realize that. That‚Äôs because most of the ESG FUD is spread by other crypto network entrepreneurs that are using it as gorilla marketing. So they would want you to think that there‚Äôs an issue. But if you thought about it for a while, you would realize that‚Ä¶ Let me just give you the fact. Bitcoin mining uses 14 basis points of the world‚Äôs energy. So like one 10th of 1% of all of the energy in the world is Bitcoin mining. It‚Äôs really de minimus. Second, it‚Äôs going to decrease. It‚Äôs headed toward one 100th of 1% because the semiconductor technology has improved by orders of magnitude. So it‚Äôs just like Moore‚Äôs law. We keep making the chips faster. So as companies like Intel, they just released a chip that‚Äôs 21 joules/terahash. And it used to be we used 1,250 joules/terahash. So it used to be a hundred times more energy intensive to mine. So the industry itself is a technology business getting exponentially more efficient. But if you look at the electricity, the electricity used is 58% sustainable already, which means that is cleaner than electricity in your Tesla or is cleaner than all the energy used in planes, trains, automobiles, buildings, food, hospitals, national defense, banking. Every other thing in the world uses dirtier energy and more energy. So if you‚Äôre really an environmentalist and I told you that 99.95% of carbon emissions come from stuff that‚Äôs not Bitcoin and Bitcoin energy efficiency is improving 36% a year. So it‚Äôs neither the problem, nor is it the solution to any environmental concern. What it is is an industry that uses encrypted energy in order to create an open permissionless crypto asset so that it is ethically technically sound. If I eliminated the energy, then I would have a security. And it‚Äôs like in Fortnite, I would‚Äôve a video game in Fortnite or Roblox, I can move coupons around without using encrypted energy like Bitcoin uses, but you‚Äôre trusting the board of directors of Fortnite or the board of directors of Roblox to not corrupt the currency and steal all your money. And since it‚Äôs a company, no country‚Äôs ever going to trust an American company to issue the currency that they run their world on, right? Plus because it‚Äôs a security, it‚Äôs unethical for a public figure to endorse a security. So if you want to create a non-security, if you want to create a property, it has to be open to permissionless. The only way that we‚Äôve ever figured out how to do that in the history of the world is proof of work mining, which is what the Bitcoin mining network is. So it‚Äôs not causing a carbon problem, it‚Äôs not even a big energy user, it‚Äôs simply is a extremely efficient use of energy because you put about $2 billion worth of electricity into a network to create an $800 billion of value. And if you compare that energy efficiency to $2 billion put into the airplane business, you realize that it‚Äôs 1,000 times more expensive to fly an airplane around and get value from that as it is to keep track of or keep a digital asset secure. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Let me ask you about some of the things around on the outside of crypto, or I guess part of the new waves of crypto. You have 40 patents. Are you buying NFTs? Michael Saylor: No. Look, Bitcoin is scarce, desirable. It‚Äôs basically a block in cyber Manhattan and there‚Äôs only going to be one and there‚Äôs no reason to think it won‚Äôt be valuable 1,000 years from now. And when you buy it, you‚Äôre buying one 21,000,000th of all the economic energy in the network, maybe all the economic energy that‚Äôs ever going to be in the world, right? It‚Äôs a very profound, deep, dominant network. NFTs represent crypto art. And they compete with physical art and sculpture and every other form of art and it‚Äôs still a fairly early embryonic business, but they‚Äôre not particularly. You can create a million, a billion, a hundred billion different NFTs. I can write an algorithm to create them. So primarily their art that has value because of the marketing of the art and other technicalities that have to do with the leverage that‚Äôs used by those crypto networks to monetize them. But I don‚Äôt see the‚Ä¶ If I was going to buy art, I would buy all the Picassos, right? And even then, say you bought all the Picasso or all Leonardo DaVinci or something like that, your bet is that the human race in 1,000 years will still value 19th century impressionist paintings, right? And if that‚Äôs your bet, there‚Äôs a risk. But I think it‚Äôs more likely the human race will value pure energy or pure money 1,000 years from now than it will value 19th century impressionist. They will have a place, but there‚Äôs 1,000 years worth of other art to be created that‚Äôs going to dilute that art and the culture. And so you‚Äôre taking a risk, you‚Äôre expressing a sentiment. Cathy Merrill: Let me ask you another question. This came from the audience. In the simplest way, because I think it could get detailed, but what applications do you see for blockchain that are outside of crypto? Blockchain‚Äôs pretty exciting. How do you see it transforming other industries or other parts of society? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt really think there‚Äôs any other low risk, compelling, obvious application of blockchain right now. I think it‚Äôs heavily marketed and hyped by people in the industry. The real compelling application of blockchain is a decentralized global crypto property that can replace gold as a non sovereign bear instrument store of value. And that‚Äôs what Bitcoin is. As that spreads, that could be worth hundreds of trillions of dollars. So that is a big idea. All the other ideas are questionable because any application you want to build, you could build with a website or a mobile phone as a company, and then you could just run it against Bitcoin. So if you really want to move money at the speed of light and sell it and give flash loans and mortgage it, you can simply build a website like Coinbase, plug Bitcoin into it and then give it to the world. The reason they don‚Äôt do that Cathy, is because it‚Äôs illegal. The reason that you don‚Äôt get a flash loan from Apple computer or Google is because it‚Äôs illegal. Because you have to get regulatory approval from the SCC. So companies don‚Äôt do these things because they‚Äôre not compliant with existing regulation. If the regulations allowed you to give flash loans and do DeFi, then Citadel or JP Morgan or a Coinbase or Apple, they could spin up a website and they could trade with 8 billion people in Singapore and China and everywhere else and they could do it with simple non decentralized code. The things that people are deal doubling with in the crypto world, they‚Äôre pursuing smart contracts and art and NFT and I grant you it‚Äôs exciting, but it‚Äôs all in the regulatory gray zone. Because for example, DeFi. DeFi is running a stock exchange without KYC. So why is it that people in the US, why is it that a company doesn‚Äôt run a stock exchange on a website without KYC? And the answer is because it‚Äôs illegal, right? It‚Äôs non-compliant and you get shut down by the regulators. So I would say, when you look at the safe harbors, it‚Äôs legal to own property in the US. It may not be legal to own property in North Korea or Cuba, right? So if you‚Äôre in a communist regime, Bitcoin might be banned. But if you‚Äôre in the Western Europe or the US and you want to own a Bitcoin in lieu of a house, you‚Äôre in a very safe zone and that‚Äôs a business which is something worth promoting. But on the other hand, if your idea is you want to run a bank, but you don‚Äôt want to comply with regulations and if you want to do lots of other things, you want to run insurance companies, but not comply with regulations, then yeah you need a decentralized thing, but is it really decentralized? And most of them aren‚Äôt really decentralized. And so that means that the regulators start to clamp down, they launch enforcement actions. So that‚Äôs why I would say, no, they‚Äôre not all equal. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs 10 ideas and they‚Äôre all equally good, you should diversify. There‚Äôs one good idea that‚Äôs worth hundreds of trillions of dollars that‚Äôll solve half the problems of the human race. And then there‚Äôs a hundred other ideas that have 1,000 X as much risk, 1,000 X as competition. And all the other things, they only exist at the pleasure of the regulators right now, right? There‚Äôs probably out of 17,000 cryptos Cathy, there might be six you could debate or property, that means a commodity. There‚Äôs one that we all agree on as a commodity that‚Äôs Bitcoin, there‚Äôs six you could debate. The rest are all securities. And if they‚Äôre all securities, they‚Äôre all unregistered securities. And if they‚Äôre all unregistered securities, that means that you really have to be a venture capitalist and you have to parse the competition, the security risk, the regulatory risk, every other liability. And you‚Äôre just wading into a very murky area of speculation. So just keep that in mind when you‚Äôre considering what do you want to promote and what do you, what do you want to dabble with. Cathy Merrill: You‚Äôre promoting Bitcoin. And so my question for you is Bitcoin famously created January, 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto who no one knows who that is. So one of my questions is, is that you because it seems like you are Mr. Bitcoin? And two, has this person ever reached out to you as the biggest owner of this thing they created? Have they ever back channeled you in some way? Michael Saylor: Okay. So you‚Äôre too kind. It‚Äôs not me. And Satoshi‚Äôs gone and never coming back and has disappeared. And it really allows me to make a point about the providence of the network. The reason that people are passionate about Bitcoin is because of the immaculate conception of Bitcoin, it‚Äôs ethically sound and it‚Äôs fair. What you had was one pseudonymous programmer that finally launched a successful crypto network that had no value for 15 months. And that‚Äôs like starting a fire, after 50 tries they‚Äôd failed and the 51st time they launched it and it caught a little bit of energy and it started to burn. Satoshi operated and there are about a million coins that are called Satoshi coins that were mined in the early years or the early year. Those have never moved. Satoshi disappeared after about 18 months, never to be heard from again and said, ‚ÄúOkay, I pass the Baton,‚Äù knowing that if this had a founder or if this had a controlling entity or if there was a company or a group of people behind it, then it would start to look more like a security and there would be a question of, is it fair? Is it fair that some early person got their coins for free? And so Bitcoin never had a pre mine, right? The Satoshi coins never moved. It never had an ICO. There was never an IPO. No insiders ever invested in it. And it‚Äôs very important to decentralize. So there was never a big company backer, a Facebook, an Apple, a Google, a Microsoft that we might not trust. There was never a nation state behind it. It was completely people. And about 15 months into it, we got to a point called pizza day. And on pizza day, Bitcoin was used to pay for two pizzas, 10,000 Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin for the first time had a value of like 2 cents. So the thing it burned with no value, nobody thought it would ever be economic. Cathy Merrill: Analogy because now those two coins that that person bought for two slices of pizza would be worth $400 million, right? Michael Saylor: Yeah. $500 million or $450 million today. But the point was the people that got involved, they were hobbyist and idealist. And what they were trying to do was create this ideal organic life form in cyberspace that was fair and equitable. We say, wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could settle our differences in a fair and equitable fashion? So that‚Äôs why say there was such pushback when Facebook was going to launch Libra. It‚Äôs like, do we want a powerful company to create their own currency and then push it down their network? It doesn‚Äôt seem fair, right? But with the Satoshi, Satoshi gave a gift to the world, a fair gift. And the fact that Satoshi disappeared and the coins never moved and the stuff never had value, it means that everybody that ever joined the movement joined it on equivalent equitable basis, right? No one had an advantage. Everybody had to take either exponentially more risk or they had to pay exponentially more money and there was nobody that controlled it. And what that meant was no one could corrupt it. And what‚Äôs really critical about Bitcoin is the fact that that monetary policy, 21 million coins, and that expectation, that block size, one megabyte block size that‚Äôs the same today as it was on pizza day when it was worth a penny. And it‚Äôs very important because if you‚Äôre going to ask me, am I willing to risk a billion dollars for 100 years? Well, if you‚Äôre going to bet a billion dollars for the next 100 years, you don‚Äôt want a piece of software that somebody just shipped last month or that they‚Äôre going to fix next year or that they‚Äôre changing or tinkering with, right? You really want to know that this thing is not going to change, it‚Äôs past the test of time, it‚Äôs got a community that‚Äôs idealistic and they‚Äôre going to fight to protect it from corruption. And there can‚Äôt be any one personality because if there‚Äôs one person that becomes a liability as opposed to a feature. Cathy Merrill: You are one person and you are betting billions. So let me ask you some personal questions, okay? Michael Saylor: Sure. Cathy Merrill: One, do you tweet yourself or do you have a team that tweets? Michael Saylor: Oh, I tweet myself. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs all me Cathy, all me. All the warts and all. This morning I tweeted Bitcoin is my daily tweet. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Do you have a goal in mind for how much Bitcoin you want to accumulate? Is there a number in your head? Michael Saylor: Another way I look at it is when we generate cash flows where we come across cash, if I hold it‚Äôs going to lose 10 to 20% of its value a year so I convert it into a stronger asset, which is Bitcoin. So we will just keep sweeping our cash flows into Bitcoin forever. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Tomorrow is Matt‚Äôs opening day. If you had a walkout song, what would it be? Michael Saylor: Eminem, Lose Yourself. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Do you have a favorite TV show right now that you‚Äôre watching? Michael Saylor: No, I don‚Äôt have a favorite one. Cathy Merrill: Tell me one book that had a huge impact on you. Michael Saylor: The Bitcoin Standard, caused me to buy billions of dollars of Bitcoin. Cathy Merrill: Okay. I know you‚Äôre a pilot. I know Elon Musk has a spaceship. I know you know him. Are we going to see you in space? Michael Saylor: Maybe one day. We‚Äôll see. Cathy Merrill: Okay. What was the last thing you bought with cryptocurrency? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt think you should buy things with cryptocurrency. I think you should buy cryptocurrency with things. So the best idea is if you had cryptocurrency, in this case Bitcoin, if you have Bitcoin and you want to buy something, you‚Äôre better off to take a loan against it and create an account of dollars or pesos and then you should sell the currency for the thing or trade the currency for the thing you want to buy. And you ought to accumulate the property and hold it forever. Cathy Merrill: What is home screen wallpaper on your phone? And is it orange? Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not orange, it‚Äôs blue and it‚Äôs a picture of Dubrovnik in Croatia, the Mediterranean Sea. Cathy Merrill: It was a beautiful city. Okay. Best concert you ever went to. Most people don‚Äôt know this, you‚Äôre very, very musical. You play yourself. You‚Äôre a musically inclined person. Best concert you ever saw? Michael Saylor: I think I really enjoy seeing Staying at Wolf Trap play up close and personal. Cathy Merrill: And finally, if the government asked you to serve, if they said, ‚ÄúLook, we need someone to regulate all this crypto and someone who knows it in depth,‚Äù would that be something that we could see from you? Michael Saylor: Above my pay grade. I‚Äôm just a humble private citizen. I think I‚Äôll let career regulators and career politicians handle the regulation and the politics. I think I‚Äôm just going to educate and advocate. Cathy Merrill: But hopefully you‚Äôll lend them your brain. Thank you for sharing it with us. There are so many more questions that I didn‚Äôt get to and that people sent in, but it is a huge subject for an hour and thank you for giving it to us. I know you‚Äôre off to speak at the Bitcoin conference, which is attracting a ton of people, so good luck on your speech on that and thank you. Michael Saylor: Thanks, Cathy. I mean, I would say to the audience, if anybody wants more information, remember hope.com. There‚Äôs a whole index of websites, free courses, books, resources, videos there, and pointers to other leaders in the space. Feel free to follow me on Twitter. I post interpretations of regulatory developments, market developments, technical developments in the entire crypto economy every day if you‚Äôre interested. There‚Äôs the Saylor academy saylor.org, has a free Bitcoin for everybody course. It‚Äôs 12 hours. It‚Äôs free. Anybody can take it. And I think the best way to communicate this this is think it‚Äôs like 1900 and someone invented electricity and they came into your town and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this new thing called electricity and we think it‚Äôs going to be in hospitals and cars and planes and trains and boats and government and schools, and we‚Äôre going to teach classes on it.‚Äù And you‚Äôre trying to figure out what does it mean to you, and the answer is, yeah, maybe it‚Äôs scary and maybe it‚Äôs exciting, but it deserves your attention. So treat it with respect and spend some time to educate yourself on it because it‚Äôs all those things. And I think the society had 30, 40 years to figure out electricity. I think it‚Äôll be a decade with people figuring out what Bitcoin is because Bitcoin in its purest form is digital energy and electricity is electrical energy. So if you have digital energy and you didn‚Äôt expect to ever see it in your lifetime, it‚Äôs a paradigm shift. And it means different things to different people. And it‚Äôs extraordinarily exciting. It‚Äôs also scary, it‚Äôs also complicated, right? And I would say everybody can benefit from it, but it‚Äôs such a novel thing that you probably have to spend some time to wrap your head around it in order to get the fullest value from it. Cathy Merrill: Okay. Hope.com, Saylor academy, that‚Äôs the place to tune in. Thank you. Michael Saylor: Thank you. All the best everybody. Cathy Merrill: Bye.

Subject a man to two decades of Wall Street shenanigans ‚Äî from before the dot-com boom until now ‚Äî and you get Michael Saylor.  The former MicroStrategy CEO and relentless Bitcoin bull is back in our feeds. In a recent podcast, Saylor huffed at the notion that buying almost $5 billion worth of bitcoin took ‚Äúconviction.‚Äù  Saylor says: ‚ÄúHow many chairs are you sitting on right now? Are you all-in on the chair? The point is you put on one pair of glasses, one pair of AirPods. You look at me through one screen, you‚Äôre using one microphone. That‚Äôs one microphone ‚Äî you trust it? Is that conviction? That seems kind of scary, why don‚Äôt you diversify? Why don‚Äôt you use 10 microphones?‚Äù The point is that we believe in lots of things in our everyday lives (like what knives we choose, says Saylor ‚Äî we probably wouldn‚Äôt trust knives made of rubber bands, does that mean we have conviction in stainless steel?) It sounds silly (because it is). It‚Äôs just that Michael Saylor wants you to know that Bitcoin is as obvious to him as anything other tool he uses in real life, from airplanes to roads (‚ÄúIf you get on an airplane, are you convicted? You put your entire family on one airplane, aren‚Äôt you afraid?‚Äù) As goofy as all this is, Saylor has so far been right about Bitcoin ‚Äî now up more than $1 billion on MicroStrategy‚Äôs purchases to date. In a world where money talks, Saylor is clearly translating it. Saylor first got into Bitcoin when he milked $30 million from Block.one, the company co-founded by BitShares and EOS ‚Äòmastermind‚Äô Dan Larimer, for the Voice.com domain in 2019 ‚Äî the most expensive domain of all time. The site has done practically nothing for Larimer and Block.one in the four years since. That deal ‚Äî which apparently cottoned Saylor onto the value-generating potential of Bitcoin ‚Äî was an impressive feat that deserves praise. The fact that Saylor‚Äôs now up on $1 billion in Bitcoin is a bonus (although the actual profit is lower, as the firm must pay out its corporate bonds sold to buy BTC). Granted, Saylor has at times peddled suspicious advice, even at the top of bull markets (sell everything you own and mortgage your house to buy bitcoin). But all cryptocurrencies have their own brand of propaganda. Ethereum is a public good, Solana isn‚Äôt centralized, Cardano is peer-reviewed, banks will adopt XRP and Tether is fully backed. Depending on who you ask, those beliefs are shared fantasies, and at worst, folie √† deux.  Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have spokespeople like most of Web3. There‚Äôs no PR department, communications folk or marketing gurus. But there‚Äôs still magazines, conferences and global initiatives ‚Äî and even a mascot in Saylor.

,,Bitcoin whale Michael Saylor urges governments to step in and regulate crypto‚Äôs ‚Äòparade of horribles‚Äô,"    XRP XRP $USD 0.54 -3.61% Dogecoin DOGE $USD 0.08 -2.46% Ethereum ETH $USD 2,907.74 -2.24% Cardano ADA $USD 0.59 -4.61%                                                             Powered by The world‚Äôs largest public holder of Bitcoin called on regulators to finally tackle a laundry list of risky, immature crypto industry practices, or ‚Äúparade of horribles,‚Äù that are unfairly weighing on the price of its asset. Microstrategy CEO Michael Saylor argues the more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies and digital tokens in circulation must be viewed as ‚Äúunregistered securities‚Äù that cannot be likened to a hard commodity like Bitcoin‚Äîwhich has no issuer, no management, no employees, no product cycle, and only a finite supply. Speaking in a webcast with NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich, Saylor said Bitcoin was being caught in the crossfire of a collapsing crypto market since it often served as collateral on margin loans for less proven tokens.  ‚ÄúWhat you have is a $400 billion cloud of opaque, unregistered securities trading without full and fair disclosure, and they are all cross-collateralized with Bitcoin,‚Äù he argued  He added mainstream financial institutions often won‚Äôt touch an asset like Bitcoin ‚Äúbecause of the slime that gets onto the asset class from all the unregistered securities.‚Äù  Nouriel Roubini, a respected economist and one of the few to predict the 2008 global financial crisis, branded crypto on Saturday a Ponzi scheme collapsing upon its own weight.  It‚Äôs attitudes like these that make Saylor, otherwise critical of government intervention in the free market during the pandemic, believe regulators should and will eventually step in to protect investors from the bad apples.  ‚ÄúIf I make a list of the parade of horribles,‚Äù Saylor said, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all going to reasonably reverse in the next 10 years.‚Äù He claimed even rock-solid multinationals like Apple would see more volatility in their share price if there were no regulations that, for example, prevent wash trading, a practice of artificially inflating prices by trading between two wallets both owned by the same party. He cited crypto hedge funds like Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, as hindrances rather than facilitators to cryptocurrency adoption.  ‚ÄúThe general public shouldn‚Äôt be buying unregistered securities from wildcat bankers that may or may not be there next Thursday,‚Äù Saylor said, whose company owns 129,218 Bitcoin as of the end of March. 3AC is at risk of complete collapse, in part due to a busted bet on the value of Luna, the governance token that backed the TerraUSD stablecoin that failed.  Last week crypto lender Celsius froze all withdrawals and transfers amid a liquidity crunch, and speculation continues as to whether the ongoing bloodbath in the market will claim only this trio as victims or whether more will eventually emerge.  ‚ÄúThe crypto exchanges, offshore and onshore, are unregistered, unregulated and offer 20x leverage, they don‚Äôt have mature Chinese walls,‚Äù Saylor said, referring to a common practice of keeping various financial services separate to prevent inherent conflicts of interest. Saylor himself is hurting as his company borrowed $205 million in March to buy more Bitcoin, pledging part of its existing holdings as security, and fears emerged last month that Silvergate Bank would demand further proof that his company was creditworthy.  Henrich did not ask him about the status of the loan or whether Microstrategy received a margin call from Silvergate. Back in August 2020, Saylor turned his business software company into a bet on the future price of Bitcoin, and is now facing impairment charges of over a billion dollars under U.S. accounting rules after the price tumbled below $18,000 this past week. Over the weekend, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele seemed to back away from a month-old pronouncement implicitly urging investors to buy the dip.  This weekend, the first man to make Bitcoin legal tender in his country simply urged enthusiasts to ‚Äúenjoy life‚Äù instead of watching the value of their investment tumble.

,,,"It‚Äôs not every day that a person loses US$6 billion, so when Michael J. Saylor did exactly that in the 2000s at the height of the internet bubble, he definitely made a name for himself. So who exactly is Saylor, what is his current net worth and how exactly did he lose billions back in the day? Let‚Äôs take a quick dive into the crypto king‚Äôs distinctive background. Born in 1965, in Nebraska, US, Saylor‚Äôs childhood was far from average. He grew up in a military family and lived on various US Air Force bases around the world. Graduating as the class valedictorian in high school, the sky was the limit for the young man. Thanks to a full Air Force scholarship, Saylor obtained dual degrees in aeronautics and astronautics, as well as science, technology and society at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It was also in uni where he met his Theta Delta Chi fraternity brother and future co-founder of MicroStrategy, Sanju K. Bansal. In 1989, at only 24 years old, Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence, mobile software and cloud-based services. Since he couldn‚Äôt fulfil his initial dream of becoming a pilot due to a benign heart murmur diagnosis, the tech whizz focused on his passions for technology, business and the use of computer simulations. Apart from being a dot-com era entrepreneur, Saylor became an author with his New York Times bestseller, The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. He also founded The Saylor Foundation (now called Saylor Academy) to offer free online courses to those who can‚Äôt afford them. He could throw quite the bash too, organising infamous themed yacht parties. In April 2022, Forbes estimated Saylor‚Äôs net worth at US$1.6 billion. That sounds pretty impressive for a tech exec, but during the 90s dot-com boom when Saylor rose through the ranks, he reached a whopping net worth of US$7 billion. His multibillionaire status, however, didn‚Äôt last long, as it was mostly gone by the turn of the century. In early 2000, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought charges against MicroStrategy‚Äôs CEO and two other executives for the company‚Äôs inaccurate reporting of financial results for the preceding two years. They eventually settled with the SEC, but never admitted any wrongdoing. Subsequently, Saylor lost his place in the 10-digit club after MicroStrategy revised its financial results and the dot-com bust then crashed the stock. After 20 years, Saylor put himself on the map again by embracing bitcoin. His belief in the volatile digital currency is so strong that he converted virtually all of MicroStrategy‚Äôs cash into the cryptocurrency and personally bought 17,732 bitcoin for US$175 million. With bitcoin‚Äôs recent plunge, MicroStrategy has lost US$1 billion in investments while Saylor‚Äôs net worth reportedly dropped to around US$500 million. Still, the bitcoin bull is not showing any signs of slowing his buying binge soon. ‚ÄúIn #bitcoin We Trust,‚Äù the CEO of MicroStrategy and crypto king said in a June 13 tweet to his 1.5 million Twitter followers.

,,Michael Saylor Warns Public: Avoid Scams Promising Free MicroStrategy Bitcoin,"Michael Saylor, the tech titan synonymous with Bitcoin and his massive holdings at MicroStrategy, has issued a warning: the cryptocurrency world is awash in scams, and your beloved Bitcoin might be at risk. Saylor‚Äôs stark revelation comes from the frontline of the battle against fraud. His team, a tireless digital janitorial squad, mops up an astonishing 80 fake YouTube videos every day, each one a meticulously crafted trap for unsuspecting investors. These nefarious schemes, often masquerading as free Bitcoin giveaways or quick-flip money doublers, exploit the names of industry giants like Saylor and MicroStrategy to lend themselves an air of legitimacy. But behind the mask lies a grim reality. Scammers leverage the allure of easy riches and prey on the excitement surrounding recent events like the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Their tactics are diverse, ranging from enticing ‚Äúengagement rewards‚Äù that lure victims into sending away their crypto to blatantly fake giveaways promising mountains of BTC in exchange for a simple scan of a QR code. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è There is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn‚Äôt give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode. My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated @YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don‚Äôt trust, verify. pic.twitter.com/gqZkQW02Ji ‚Äî Michael Saylor‚ö°Ô∏è (@saylor) January 13, 2024  ‚ÄúThere is no risk-free way to double your Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor cautions. This golden rule, often lost in the frenzy of the cryptosphere, should resonate with every investor. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. MicroStrategy, with its record-breaking Bitcoin reserves, makes a particularly juicy target for these digital grifters. Saylor points out that his company‚Äôs reputation is constantly being hijacked to lend credibility to elaborate scams. This underscores the need for extreme caution, especially when encountering offers involving prominent figures or companies in the space. But the threat extends beyond MicroStrategy. The arrival of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, much anticipated by the industry, has Saylor worried about an impending wave of new scams. With the influx of non-crypto-native investors eager to jump on the bandwagon, scammers will have a fresh pool of potential victims to exploit. Michael Saylor isn‚Äôt the only one raising the alarm. The Ripple ecosystem, long plagued by scam accusations, has further fueled concerns about YouTube‚Äôs role in hosting and allowing these illicit activities to flourish. The platform‚Äôs lax approach to policing its content has drawn sharp criticism, leaving many to wonder if enough is being done to protect investors.

,,MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet produces over 300% gain for investors in 2023,"                                                                                                                    In this article MicroStrategy
was founded almost 35 years ago and existed for most of its history as a little-known software company focused on business intelligence. But in 2023, the stock has soared 337%, making it one of the biggest gainers in the U.S. among companies valued at $5 billion or more, topping Nvidia‚Äôs
234% rally and Meta‚Äôs
194% surge. Unlike its tech peers, which rely on revenue growth and market share gains to fuel their stock prices, MicroStrategy‚Äôs
investor appeal is almost exclusively due to bitcoin
. The company began buying the cryptocurrency in mid-2020 and has since amassed roughly 174,530 bitcoins, worth about $7.65 billion as of late Friday. Wall Street is so enamored by the story that the stock has about doubled bitcoin‚Äôs gain this year. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really bitcoin,‚Äù said Joseph Vafi, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has a buy recommendation on the stock. ‚ÄúAll the other stuff is healthy and doing a good job, they‚Äôre not neglecting it. It‚Äôs doing well, it‚Äôs leading software in its sector. But it‚Äôs basically something we don‚Äôt have to worry about.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap is $8.5 billion, meaning 90% of its valued is tied directly to its bitcoin holdings. When bitcoin plummets or soars, so does MicroStrategy. In 2022, bitcoin‚Äôs 64% drop pushed MicroStrategy down 74%. Even after its huge pop this year, MicroStrategy shares are still below where they were trading at their high in 2021, during peak crypto. The bitcoin strategy dates back to July 2020, when the company said it would start putting some of its cash towards alternative assets, including digital currencies. At the time, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $1.1 billion, built on a software business that had been shrinking since 2015. Annual revenue was just under $500 million, and profit was minimal. At the halfway point of 2020, MicroStrategy had just over $530 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Co-founder Michael Saylor, who was CEO at the time, saw that money sitting virtually idle on the sidelines due to low interest rates and wanted to put it to work. From there, he had to decide whether equities, precious metals or bitcoin would be the best use of funds. ‚ÄúThe reason we decided to buy bitcoin is because bitcoin represents a form of digital gold,‚Äù Saylor said on the first earnings call after the company announced its strategy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs harder than gold. It‚Äôs smarter, it‚Äôs stronger, it‚Äôs faster than gold.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs decision created a way for investors to have stake in bitcoin through routine purchases of stock, rather than having to buy the coins directly. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO last year and assumed the role of executive chairman, told CNBC‚Äôs Morgan Brennan last week that he expects the bull market in bitcoin to continue next year. He said 99.9% of the capital in the world is invested in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities, with only 0.1% allocated toward bitcoin. ‚ÄúPeople, as they get educated on digital assets, are realizing that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to this digital asset and so they‚Äôre moving from .1 to .2%,‚Äù said Saylor, who co-authored a book about bitcoin last year titled ‚ÄúWhat is Money?‚Äù MicroStrategy isn‚Äôt the first company to put some of its cash pile into alternative investments, and it‚Äôs not the last to look for ways to generate outsized returns on that money. Earlier this month, GameStop gave CEO Ryan Cohen, who gained minor celebrity status as an investor, permission to use company cash to purchase stock. But MicroStrategy is unique in that it‚Äôs become viewed almost exclusively as a bitcoin holding company. ‚ÄúMichael Saylor‚Äôs kind of a visionary,‚Äù said Vafi. ‚ÄúHe saw this as an opportunity to really exploit the fact that they had a lot of cash and a pristine balance sheet and start this bitcoin treasury experiment. And it‚Äôs worked out well and so they‚Äôre continuing down that path.‚Äù In analyzing why MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has so dramatically outperformed bitcoin this year, Vafi described it as a ‚Äúscarcity premium,‚Äù because there are limited ways for equity investors to tap the market. That‚Äôs potentially changing in the new year, as investors gear up for a flurry of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, there are bitcoin futures ETFs, which are comprised of contracts to buy and sell bitcoin but not of the cryptocurrency itself. And investors can buy into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust
, a fund that owns bitcoin and trades over the counter rather than on a major exchange. Grayscale sued the SEC last year after the regulator denied its application to create a spot bitcoin ETF on concerns about investor protections. In August of this year, an appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale, a decision than many in the industry viewed as paving the way for a new crop of ETFs. Asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have filed with the SEC for their own products.  Vafi said the prospect of competition poses little threat to MicroStrategy. ‚ÄúI call it right now a very high-class problem to a certain degree,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf a bitcoin ETF gets approved, the price of bitcoin is probably headed higher and potentially materially higher.‚Äù MicroStrategy also presents more than just a bet on the direction of bitcoin. While ETFs are passively managed, MicroStrategy has the option to put its bitcoin holdings to work, using them, for example, as collateral to create more business opportunities. ‚ÄúMicroStrategy is encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment around bitcoin as well as the increased institutional demand that we are seeing today,‚Äù Shirish Jajodia, the company‚Äôs vice president of treasury and investor relations, told CNBC in an email. ‚ÄúWe do believe it will have a positive impact on the adoption of bitcoin by mainstream investors as well as corporations.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs software business is a big plus too, Saylor said on the company‚Äôs most recent earnings call. It‚Äôs a proven cash flow generator, enabling the company to buy more bitcoin, he said. For the many investors betting against MicroStrategy, it‚Äôs been a tough year. As of early December, crypto stock short sellers were down $6.1 billion for the year, with the rally in Coinbase
hurting them the most, according to S3 Partners. In the first three quarters of the year, short sellers spent $2.19 billion covering their bets, the firm said, with the majority of the buying in Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Short sellers this year have lost $4 billion on Coinbase and $1.4 billion on MicroStrategy, according to data provided by S3 last week. Some 23% of MicroStrategy‚Äôs shares available to the public are shorted, S3 said, which is second highest among crypto companies, behind only bitcoin miner Marathon Digital
. The average for U.S. stocks is 5%. MicroStrategy shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to snapping pu bitcoin. The company said it purchased roughly 16,130 bitcoins in November for over $593 million, even with the price continuing to rise. That‚Äôs more bitcoin than it‚Äôs bought in any full quarter since the first three months of 2021. ‚Äî CNBC‚Äôs Kate Dore contributed to this report WATCH: Bitcoin bounces back above $43,000 Got a confidential news tip?

,,,"   Admin Nas Academy 24 Jun ¬∑ 5 min read Early crypto investors have long seen the results of their foresight, and Bitcoin investor Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth is a reflection of it. A long time veteran of falling markets and plummeting share prices, Michael Saylor has learned to ride the wave and stick around until the market prices start climbing once again. To that end, his personal investment is the largest in the world, beating Elon Musk‚Äôs own investment. He continues to be a vocal supporter of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth is currently $1 billion.  If you‚Äôre interested in crypto, check out our classes that range from learning about branded metaverse investment to building NFT communities. Michael Saylor is an entrepreneur and business executive. Born on February 4, 1965, he‚Äôs involved in tech industries and is known for owning the largest amounts of Bitcoin ‚Äî with 129,218 Bitcoin tokens, as of March 2022. Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy, a company that provides business intelligence and analytics, mobile software, and cloud-based services. He‚Äôs not just involved in business, but also works towards prediction of new technology and how it‚Äôll evolve over time. He wrote about mobile phone development in his 2012 book The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything. He is also the sole trustee of Saylor Academy, a provider of free online education.     Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth has been driven by innovations in technology, and so it‚Äôs not surprising that he‚Äôs invested heavily in crypto, particularly in Bitcoin. However, business and tech weren‚Äôt the original industries he was interested in.  As the child of an Air Force pilot for the US military Michael Saylor spent most of his childhood moving across the world as his father was assigned to different bases. After graduating high school, Saylor attended MIT and studied aeronautics and astronautics along with science, technology, and society. Saylor intended to follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps and become an Air Force pilot, but his dream crumbled due to a medical condition that barred him from serving. Instead, he turned to computer sciences and software programming.   This led him to founding MicroStrategy with a friend from MIT. MicroStrategy began developing software for data mining, then moved to focus on developing software for business intelligence. MicroStrategy hit a lucky break when it won a $10 million contract with McDonald‚Äôs to develop applications to analyze the efficiency of its promotions. Not only was this a lucrative deal, but it led Saylor to the realization that his company could create business intelligence software that would allow companies to use their own data for insights into their businesses. Since the company went public in the mid-1990s, its stock has made Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth skyrocket to over $7 billion and secured his spot as one of the most well-known billionaires of the Internet bubble.  Michael Saylor has since been in the spotlight for various reasons‚Ä¶ And not all of them are positive. In particular, he‚Äôs been criticized for a notice he sent to MicroStrategy employees about the response to COVID-19, questioning health department responses to the virus and the recommended public safety measures. The notice was uploaded to Reddit for several minutes before being taken down, and was reported in the Washington Business Journal.  As a clear investor in technologies of the future, Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth has changed dramatically because of his investment into Bitcoin. In fact, Michael Saylor‚Äôs bought more Bitcoin than anyone else in the world, and even one of the worst crashes in crypto hasn‚Äôt dissuaded him from the cryptocurrency.  Michael Saylor‚Äôs net worth skyrocketed after he bought 17,732 Bitcoin tokens below $10,000 in 2020. Saylor‚Äôs personal 17,732 Bitcoin were worth $640.2 million on May 6 and then dropped to $531.9 million on the next Friday, equating to a loss of $108.25 million in just one week. This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs gone through a massive loss in wealth because of a fall in the markets. The Internet bubble was a similar situation, where in 2000 Saylor‚Äôs company MicroStrategy‚Äôs stocks plummeted so fast that Saylor lost $6 billion in one day.   And he didn‚Äôt stop at personal investments. All of MicroStrategy‚Äôs spare funding has gone into Bitcoin investments, and were recently valued at $3.9 billion, a massive fall from $4.6 billion the week before because of the plummeting market. Saylor‚Äôs personal fortune is now hovering around $1 billion. Despite the fact that Bitcoin‚Äôs value has dropped 70% since November 2021, his faith in crypto remains unshaken. Saylor attributes the crash to the growing pains that are typical of a new industry. In a recent interview, he said that, ‚ÄúBitcoin represents the digital transformation of money, property, currency, energy, & matter‚Ä¶ It is still at an early stage in its development and poorly understood‚Äù. He‚Äôs also gone on to compare crypto to the oil and motor industries, which saw crashes that wiped out up to 99% of companies in the industry. As Saylor‚Äôs already been through one new industry finding its legs, his policy of weathering the storm might work out for him and bring returns on his massive investment.

,,Michael Saylor quits as MicroStrategy CEO after Bitcoin losses,"                  BY:
HAMZA FAREED MALIK Crypto advocate Michael Saylor stepped down as CEO of MicroStrategy after the software company took a near $1bn (¬£0.8bn) loss in Bitcoin. Saylor, a prominent supporter and investor of Bitcoin, will now be Executive Chairman after MicroStrategy faced an impairment charge of over $917m (¬£757m) on its Bitcoin holding in the second quarter of 2022 as the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price plunged in the crypto market crash. MicroStrategy holds 129,699 Bitcoin, bought for about $30,664 (¬£25,380) each, totalling $4 billion (¬£3.3bn). The token‚Äôs price has tumbled 50 per cent this year to about $23,350 (¬£19,250). It has plummeted almost 70 per cent from its all-time high of near $69,000 in November 2021. The company is the world‚Äôs biggest largest publicly-traded corporate holder of Bitcoin and was the first public company to adopt bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset. Saylor revealed that he personally held about 17,732 bitcoin and has said he will keep focusing on Bitcoin in his next job. ‚ÄúI believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúAs Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.‚Äù READ MORE Michael Saylor: ‚ÄòI have never been more bullish on Bitcoin‚Äô  SHARE THIS ARTICLE Subscribe to the City A.M. newsletter to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

,,Here's Why Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Are Buying All the Bitcoin They Can Get Their Hands On,"  You‚Äôre reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool‚Äôs Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More For many equity investors, Michael Saylor may not be a household name. But for crypto investors, Michael Saylor is legendary for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC -1.77%), as well as for some of his more outlandish takes on social media about the future of crypto. His company, MicroStrategy (MSTR -5.47%), is now the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and it's not even close. After buying an additional $615 million worth of Bitcoin at the end of 2023, his company now owns close to 1% of all Bitcoin in the world. Even more remarkably, MicroStrategy only started buying Bitcoin back in 2020, more than a decade after Bitcoin originally launched. But in the past three-plus years, Saylor and his company have consistently added to their Bitcoin position, through a variety of different market conditions. So what's behind this push to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can? As Saylor has reiterated over and over again, Bitcoin is the single best store of value over the long haul -- even better than gold. In fact, Saylor has even opined that the market cap of Bitcoin (now just under $1 trillion) could one day approach the market cap of physical gold, which is estimated to be around $13 trillion. There are several reasons for this admittedly audacious point of view. One is that Bitcoin has a limited lifetime supply. According to the algorithm powering Bitcoin, the total lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at just 21 million coins. The current circulating supply is close to 19.5 million coins, so we are getting close to the point where all the Bitcoin that will ever be created has already been created. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. As Bitcoin adoption surges on a global scale, it will increase its relative scarcity. More people will be vying to gain access to a very limited supply, and over time, that is going to boost the price of Bitcoin. It's just basic economics. With supply largely unchanged, and demand going through the roof, the price of Bitcoin should soar. Moreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin makes it attractive for another reason: It is arguably the single-best hedge against inflation over the long term. While gold investors may find this point highly debatable, the underlying logic does make a certain amount of sense, especially when you compare Bitcoin to fiat currency (i.e., currency controlled by governments and central banks, such as the U.S. dollar). This is due to the fact that an algorithm carefully controls the rate at which new Bitcoin is created. In fact, every four years, Bitcoin actually becomes more deflationary when the rate of new Bitcoin creation is cut in half (i.e., ""the halving""). In contrast, a central bank can (theoretically) print as much money as it wants, which is what can lead to inflation and even hyperinflation. Putting this all together, I think there are several lessons for the average investor. Perhaps the most important lesson is the need for a long-term outlook. As Saylor has pointed out over and over again, his Bitcoin strategy is not a short-term trading strategy. This is all about buying Bitcoin for the long haul, and letting the market do its magic. Another key lesson is the need to stick to a buy-and-hold strategy, through a variety of different market conditions. Yes, MicroStrategy started accumulating Bitcoin during the last bull market rally, at a time when Bitcoin was skyrocketing to an all-time high of $69,000. But the company was not afraid to add to its position during the crypto market downturn, and Saylor now looks like a market savant, with Bitcoin poised for its next major market rally. Finally, it's never too late to invest in an asset if you truly believe in its long-term potential for price appreciation. Saylor and MicroStrategy regularly update the public on just how much Bitcoin they own, as well as the average purchase cost of each Bitcoin. Remarkably, the average cost of a single Bitcoin for Saylor at the end of November was $30,252. In essence, that means he completely missed out on the period of time (an entire decade!) in which Bitcoin surged from $1 to $30,000. So, no, it's not too late to invest in Bitcoin. It's easy to understand why Saylor is so unabashedly bullish on Bitcoin. But before you rush out and buy Bitcoin, make sure you fully understand the reason why Saylor is buying Bitcoin hand over fist. It's not just because Bitcoin is soaring in price -- it's because Bitcoin has certain inherent properties that make it valuable over the long haul. Despite the risk and volatility of crypto, the long-term outlook certainly seems bullish for Bitcoin. When Saylor recently appeared on CNBC, he suggested that Bitcoin had the potential to increase in value by 10x. At its current price of $44,000, a 10x valuation multiple means that a single Bitcoin could theoretically one day be worth close to half a million dollars. Own just two Bitcoins, and you could one day become a millionaire. Dominic Basulto has positions in Bitcoin. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Bitcoin.

,,BTC099: DEEP DIVE ON BITCOIN ENERGY MISCONCEPTIONS,"October 11, 2022 Preston Pysh interviews billionaire Michael Saylor about Bitcoin‚Äôs energy use. Michael provides insights on why Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù, and why many people misunderstand its use. SUBSCRIBE  Disclaimer: The transcript that follows has been generated using artificial intelligence. We strive to be as accurate as possible, but minor errors and slightly off timestamps may be present due to platform differences. Preston Pysh (00:00:03): Hey everyone, welcome to this Wednesday‚Äôs release of the Bitcoin Fundamentals podcast. Back by popular demand, I have the one and only billionaire, Michael Saylor. This conversation is the second episode in what I would describe as a three part series on why Bitcoin‚Äôs proof of work and energy use is essential for changing the world. Last week I interviewed MIT graduate student, Jason Lowery, where he provided an in depth discussion on the importances of the differences between proof of work and proof of stake. This episode can be found as BTC 98. I think it‚Äôs important for people to listen to that conversation before listening to this conversation with Michael. Preston Pysh (00:00:40): With this conversation, Michael provides an in depth overview of why the energy is so important for protecting Bitcoin security integrity. Additionally, Michael covers numerous misconceptions and failures in critical thinking when it comes to Bitcoin‚Äôs energy use. This is a long conversation, but to ensure we covered the topic in a comprehensive way that can serve as a resource that you can share with your family and friends, we made sure that no stone was left unturned. If you ever have somebody tell you that Bitcoin uses too much energy, hopefully this episode number 99 with Michael Saylor is at the top of your list to share with them. With that, sit back and I hope you enjoy the conversation. Intro (00:01:23): You‚Äôre listening to Bitcoin Fundamentals by The Investor‚Äôs Podcast Network. Now, for your host, Preston Pysh. Preston Pysh (00:01:41): All right. Like I said in the introduction, I‚Äôm here with the one and only Michael Saylor. Welcome back to the show. Michael Saylor (00:01:46): Thanks, Preston. Preston Pysh (00:01:48): Hey, so Michael, last week I had Jason Lowery on the show, and Jason and I did a deep dive on all the nuances between proof of work and proof of stake. And one of the things that Jason has really outlined in what I think is a meaningful way is why Bitcoin requires energy to tether itself to reality. And this is something that we‚Äôre going to cover in depth today during our deep dive on energy, energy FUD and whatnot. I want to start off this conversation with a quote from Jeff Booth, and Jeff has this theory or thesis that if the currency isn‚Äôt scarce, every desirable good on the planet will become scarce. I‚Äôm curious if you agree with this idea. If you do, I‚Äôm kind of curious why you think it‚Äôs important. Michael Saylor (00:02:36): I do agree with the idea, and I think that ultimately it‚Äôs anchored in the laws of thermodynamics. The whole premise that is required for the universe to function is conservation of energy. At first, you have to have the existence of energy, and then you have to have the conservation of energy. In the Bible, the first thing we remember is God says, let there be light that. So everything starts with the deity pointing out that in the absence of light, which is energy, there is no life. Darkness is the absence of energy. Energy is fundamental, but conservation of energy is what makes the universe rational, is what makes it work. I think Jeff Booth is pointing out that, right? That the idea of scarcity of money is the same as saying, if money is conservative, then everything else will be conservative. If money is non-conservative, the world goes insane.  Michael Saylor (00:03:41): I think the examples there that pop up, a commodity without energy is a coupon. If I have a dozen eggs and I take the eggs away and I replace it with a sheet of paper or a text message, and I send you a text message saying, ‚ÄúThis is good for dozen eggs.‚Äù Now, I‚Äôve created a coupon, but I don‚Äôt have a commodity anymore. Now, the problem is you might forward the text message to a million of your friends and now you have a million text messages that are all coupons, but you don‚Äôt have the eggs that equal the coupons and so that‚Äôs an example of non-conservative money, right? Money without energy is credit. Commodities without energy are coupons. In cyberspace, an object without energy is an image. If you have an object and there‚Äôs no energy, it‚Äôs like Plato shadow, a person without energy is a ghost. Michael Saylor (00:04:40): When you make a comment and there‚Äôs no energy to back it, it lacks credibility. And if you have a cyber persona and there‚Äôs no energy that backs it, again, you lack credibility. The energy itself is what creates cost to a copy. Having a cost to a copy is what creates scarcity. If there is no cost to a copy, if we come back to that example of I want to go to a party and I‚Äôve got one ticket, and then I email the one ticket to 10,000 friends, the first friend gets sent to the party, and the next 9,999 friends either A, they all get into the party and the party collapses in chaos, right? Because now you‚Äôve got 10,000 people in a room that holds 200 people and the fire marshal shuts down the party. Preston Pysh (00:05:32): And they‚Äôre consuming everything. Michael Saylor (00:05:33): That‚Äôs what happens when the coupon gets redeemed 10,000 times against a single commodity and the other possibility is the person running the party is competent and they only let the first person in because they‚Äôre scanning and they deny the next 9,999 people. Then what you have is chaos at the door, 9,999 people, they‚Äôre just mad, they couldn‚Äôt get in and kind of a breakdown in civilization because now people all go crazy. They all literally go crazy because they think they had the coupon to get into the party, but they didn‚Äôt. And so when I apply that to a coupon for food, a coupon for energy, a coupon for access, et cetera, then what you‚Äôve got is an example of everyone plunged into chaos. Nothing has any credibility anymore. I think Booth says, if money is the ultimate coupon, the ultimate coupon is there‚Äôs 21 million units of money and you can‚Äôt make anymore. If I want to guarantee that it‚Äôll be scarce, then I inject energy into each coupon, right? Michael Saylor (00:06:46): That‚Äôs equivalent to 21 million gold coins. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs energy infuse. So there‚Äôs some expense to it, so it‚Äôs credible. But if I want to make it perfect, then I have to come up with a decentralized ledger Bitcoin type system where it‚Äôs not just 21 million gold coins, it‚Äôs 21 million Bitcoin and no one can mine anymore Bitcoin, no matter how much energy they expense. In that case, I go from digital coupon when I have no energy to digital commodity, when I have energy, and if I want to become digital scarcity, I have to have digital protocol or scarcity protocol that the energy circulates within. So Satoshi‚Äôs protocol converts a commodity into scarcity. If you kept the same proof of work protocol and use proof of work, but you didn‚Äôt cap the Bitcoin at 21 million and you didn‚Äôt have halvings, the difficulty adjustment controls the rate at which the 21 million coins come out and says they have to take until the year 2140. Michael Saylor (00:07:50): But the halvings asymptotically approach 21 million and what they say is, we exponentially decrease the amount of Bitcoin that get produced until we get to 21 million and then we stop produce anymore. The real genius of Bitcoin there is you haven‚Äôt created a coupon, you haven‚Äôt even created digital commodity, you‚Äôve created a digital scarcity due to the protocol, and the digital scarcity created absolute scarcity that‚Äôs fixed. And because you created an absolute fixed scarcity, you created the perfect money and the ideal investment asset, now people can start to act rationally. The other half of the observation is, if the money is totally not scarce, if I can produce 20 coupons, 200 coupons, 20 million coupons, if I told you here‚Äôs the ticket to the party, first guy gets in, you rush to the party knowing that you don‚Äôt want to be the second person. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm saying, here‚Äôs some money. Michael Saylor (00:08:50): It‚Äôs getting inflated at a fast rate, and you‚Äôre rushing to spend it before it goes to zero. One aspect of the lack of scarcity is I‚Äôm urgently wanting to use the coupon and I‚Äôm using it even though my wife is delivering a baby, and I probably should be in the hospital, but instead I‚Äôm rushing off to spend the money because the money will be worthless by the time the baby is born. So you‚Äôre caught in this wicked conundrum where you have to make irrational decisions because the clock is ticking, and that‚Äôs one big problem. Preston Pysh (00:09:25): You‚Äôre incentivized that if you know there‚Äôs going to be a thousand coupons, I‚Äôm now incentivized to go to the gatekeeper, issuing them to try to get to front run everybody else. And this is our Cantillon effect, kind of why that incentive exists in this type of system that you‚Äôre describing? Michael Saylor (00:09:44): You end up with a dilemma of impatience, like irrational urgency. Then the other dilemma is lack of credibility because since they‚Äôre just coupons, and I had the experience, maybe I got in the party first and yeah, that‚Äôs good, but if I got to the party third and I got rejected, then I‚Äôm angry about it. Now, the next time someone offers me a coupon for something else, here‚Äôs a coupon for a dozen oranges, I think, well, this one‚Äôs probably also going to go to zero. You go through these phases, the phase of ignorance, I didn‚Äôt think there was a problem. I get to the party, I get denied. Then the phase of urgency, I know there‚Äôs a problem. I rush to the party, I get in. Then the phase of apathy, there‚Äôs no way I can beat 999 other people. Someone will get to the party before me. Michael Saylor (00:10:33): So this thing is worthless. It‚Äôs toilet paper, I might as well just throw it away. Whenever you give me something, I think it lacks substance and I don‚Äôt value it. And so now, you have a breakdown of trust in all the systems, a breakdown of trade, a breakdown of credibility, and we come back to in the economy, you‚Äôve got these classic examples, the money is becoming worthless. I have to trade it for something that isn‚Äôt going to become worthless. You just get lots of inefficiency and panic. But in cyberspace, we see this manifested for whenever I post on Twitter, 99 Twitter bots will comment and they will say, ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt anybody talking about this?‚Äù Or they‚Äôll give you the crypto giveaway or they‚Äôll offer to let you join their telegram group to get free trading advice. Those are all examples of non-real people. Michael Saylor (00:11:29): They‚Äôre not real, so they‚Äôre not credible. The credibility disappears from all of the personas. They‚Äôre obviously just bots. They‚Äôre bots because there‚Äôs no energy content in the bot. But what happens by inference is first the credibility disappears from the persona, then the credibility disappears from the comment, and then the credibility disappears from the overall system. I went to a party, there were 500 ghosts, they all lied to me. Then I realized I was the only person at the party. Then the party wasn‚Äôt fun anymore. I took myself home and I realized that I‚Äôd inadvertently been hanging out in a haunted house. That‚Äôs what you get, right? Preston Pysh (00:12:13): Yeah. Michael Saylor (00:12:13): When you go to a party of ghosts. And what I‚Äôve used, what I‚Äôve said, and metaphorically that describes my DMs and Twitter, I think I have a 100,000 direct messages of which in the 100,000, there are 57 legitimate ones that describes my DMs in Instagram, that describes right now if I go to Twitter and I post something, there might be a 1,000 or 1,500 comments of which there might be 50 real comments. We have all of these ghost parties going on and the best situation is, well, they‚Äôre just ignored. But the worst situation is the ghost get in your head and drive you insane, literally insane. What happens when your daughter logs into Instagram and finds an 18 year old football quarterback from the school across town that praises her and then it turns out that‚Äôs really a 65 year old inmate. It‚Äôs like, you don‚Äôt really know what they are. I think Booth‚Äôs example is conventional economics and he points out that if the money is not scarce, everything else will be because of hyperinflation and economic collapse. There is no method for storing and rationally allocating energy across time and space, so he‚Äôs pointing that out. But that economic metaphor, that can be applied in cyberspace, the same thing happens. In essence, you have a collapse of civility and security and credibility in cyberspace on YouTube or Instagram or Twitter or Facebook. You can also apply it as a biological metaphor. If I suck all the oxygen out of your blood, or if I just open up one of your arteries and your blood pressure goes to zero, and you can also apply‚Ä¶ So you‚Äôre bleeding to death. Michael Saylor (00:14:04): And that‚Äôs also an example of an energy collapse. And of course, you have an energy collapse. If I go into a room, maybe I go into a school and the school is in the Arctic and it‚Äôs 68 degrees and everybody‚Äôs studying and cooperating and working well with each other and they‚Äôre very efficient and they‚Äôre working in the lab and they‚Äôre doing things and they‚Äôre constructing things and writing books and poems and playing music. Then I crank the temperature down to 58 degrees and then someone gets up where they walk around a little bit and they go and put a coat and they get distracted. Then I crank the temperature out of 48 degrees and then I crank the temperature out of 38 degrees. At some point, the person that was actually composing the symphony is now just jumping up and down to try to keep from freezing to death. Michael Saylor (00:14:50): Then the kids are fighting with each other over who gets the clothes or who gets the blanket. When I crank the temperature down at 28 degrees, there‚Äôs no teaching, there‚Äôs no creating, there‚Äôs no joy. The only thing you‚Äôre doing is attempting to avoid freezing to death. And in the midst, there‚Äôs a lot of fighting. You close the door, I want to burn your desk. You‚Äôll burn the room down. Why didn‚Äôt you give me your lighter? You‚Äôre too close to me. Get closer. All sorts of crazy insanity. All of these systems all collapse because the energy and the fluid lapses, the energy lapse. I think classic Austrian economics, as you need hard money in order to solve the coincidence of once and in order to trade over spent across domains, through space and through time. I have to have hard money and hard money is simply efficient energy circulation. Michael Saylor (00:15:47): I need a fluid that moves through the system that‚Äôs no different than your blood holds oxygen and you‚Äôre not bleeding or it‚Äôs no different than I‚Äôve got a coolant in the radiator, right? Isn‚Äôt there a fluid through the system for heat exchange? That‚Äôs what you need. If I want to break it, I either remove the fluid or I put a defect in the circulatory system. Generally, the result is a breakdown of cooperation, a breakdown of trust, a breakdown of credibility, a breakdown of patients. How do I do anything that takes four years if I have enough oxygen for one year? How do I do anything that takes three months if I have enough oxygen for three minutes? The only way that I get something sophisticated done that requires extraordinary cooperation is I have to have a long enough time horizon and I have to have an efficient means of cooperation and money. Money is critical technology for that, but really money is just energy. Preston Pysh (00:16:52): Michael, would you‚Ä¶ Michael Saylor (00:16:52): And we can talk about money, but we should just always take it back to the creation of the universe, which is everything works naturally because of conservation of energy, the existence of energy and matter. Preston Pysh (00:17:07): That‚Äôs where I wanted to go. When you say conservation of energy, and you talk about how this is so important to the physical universe, is it possible to create a digital money without injecting energy into it? It sounds like you‚Äôre saying that‚Äôs impossible, is that correctly summarized? Michael Saylor (00:17:30): I don‚Äôt think you can. I don‚Äôt think you can. I think that we only have discovered one way that is settled and universally agreed upon to create digital energy or a digital commodity and the one way is proof of work. I take electricity and I run it through some kind of hashing algorithm. You could do it with SHA-256. I mean, you could probably come up with another hashing algorithm. You can come up with certain other algorithms that do it, but I‚Äôm modulating electricity to do work. I‚Äôd say bitcoin‚Äôs an example of the creation of a digital commodity. As I said before, if you took away the difficulty adjustment and you took away the halvings, you could have a commodity more so than a scarcity. The brilliance of Bitcoin is not just that it‚Äôs a digital commodity, but that it‚Äôs a digital scarcity. If I uncap the amount of Bitcoin, I just let you continue to create it. Michael Saylor (00:18:27): Well, I‚Äôve got a digital commodity. Well, I mean, oil is a physical commodity, and so it‚Äôs uncapped. I mean, the reason that oil is not necessarily as good in investment as Bitcoin over the long term is A, it‚Äôs not digital and so I can‚Äôt carry $10 billion worth of oil on a USB stick, but I can carry $10 billion worth of Bitcoin. And the second reason is it‚Äôs not a scarcity. A 100 oil miners or oil refiners can produce a hundred times as much as one, whereas with Bitcoin, a 100 Bitcoin miners can‚Äôt produce any more Bitcoin than one Bitcoin miner can produce. Oil‚Äôs not a scarcity, it‚Äôs a commodity, and it‚Äôs the physical commodity. Bitcoin is a digital commodity. Now, other people have launched, I mean, other groups have launched crypto networks that use proof of work, I mean, Ethereum was a proof of work network. You‚Äôve got the Bitcoin forks, a handful of other cryptos that are proof of work networks. That might make them, what would I say? Michael Saylor (00:19:28): It might make them an ersatz or an architectural digital commodity. It doesn‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôre a specialty or it doesn‚Äôt guarantee their digital scarcity. For example, Dogecoin keeps increasing its supply. It‚Äôs not a scarcity, it‚Äôs a proof of work protocol that creates more and more and more, right? It‚Äôs commodity in the same way that someone creates more silver or more soybeans every year. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them regulatory commodities or ethical commodities. And the distinction there is if Apple computer launched a proof of work network tomorrow and it kept half the coins, it wouldn‚Äôt be an ethical commodity. It would be an architectural digital commodity. But Apple computer makes it a security because there‚Äôs a pre mine. And so if there‚Äôs a pre mine or if there‚Äôs an ICO, or if I created a protocol where 10% of all the coins that were mined were funneled to a wallet that I controlled, that I used to pay developers, all of those things make it more of an investment contractor security, even though it‚Äôs using energy. Michael Saylor (00:20:47): The use of energy doesn‚Äôt guarantee that something‚Äôs a commodity. The use of proof of work doesn‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôs a scarcity, right? Because the protocol is what makes it a scarcity, and the providence is what makes it ethical and a commodity. So Bitcoin is special because it has a providence of Satoshi disappears, that Satoshi coins never moved. There‚Äôs no ICO, there‚Äôs no central development organization, there‚Äôs no protocol that funnels energy to developers and there‚Äôs no pre mine. The ethical launch of the digital commodity could create a regulatory commodity or an ethical commodity, which would be deemed as an asset without an issuer, right? An asset without an issuer is a technical definition. The regulatory definition of a commodity. So the oranges, wheat, coal, steel, soybeans, oil, natural gas are all assets without an issuer but they‚Äôre not capped. Bitcoin is the asset without the issuer because the ethical providence and the way that it becomes without an issuer is you have to have a consensus mechanism that doesn‚Äôt require the coordination of engineers. Michael Saylor (00:22:06): The problem with proof of stake is that proof of stake is a simulation of the universe or an imaginary universe. You‚Äôre imagining energy and you‚Äôre cutting a virtual machine. I literally call it a virtual machine, a virtual machine with virtual energy in the form of virtual tokens for virtual security, all manifested in software code. Someone has to write that software code. And if you write that software code and you keep changing it over and over and over again, then you‚Äôve got this problem, which is how can I continually change the software without someone having influence over the software? In essence, have created a software company. So with Ethereum, the Ethereum Foundation is a software company. There‚Äôs a lot of software engineers that have to write the software. They have to be paid, someone has to budget for the payment of the engineers. The only hope you have of something based on software becoming a commodity is you write the software once you gift it to the world, and then you stop changing it and you distributed across 20, 30, 50, a 100, a 1,000 different parties. Michael Saylor (00:23:18): And if everybody can run the software and if there‚Äôs no need to change it, and if no one organization controls it, now it becomes sufficiently decentralized. So you see, that‚Äôs the fact pattern with Bitcoin. The reason it‚Äôs important for Bitcoin to be simple is the software, the protocol needed to be substantially finished when it was first released by January 3rd, 2009. They needed to have it done. They couldn‚Äôt keep changing the protocol because otherwise you end up with a software company. So proof of work allows you to place the consensus and the security and the integrity of the network in the hands of Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin node runners. So you‚Äôre using electricity and you‚Äôre using 256 Asics in order to create the security and the integrity of the network. That‚Äôs generally thermodynamically bound and it‚Äôs open and everybody can participate and anybody can create their own Bitcoin miner. Michael Saylor (00:24:19): Anybody can mine Bitcoin, anybody can‚Ä¶ Electricity is broadly found in the universe, and you‚Äôre not waiting. You don‚Äôt need the permission of anybody to allow you to get on a network and mine, nor do you need the permission of anybody to run a node. It‚Äôs permissionless and that‚Äôs what makes it without an issuer. As soon as you decide that you want to get rid of the energy, then you‚Äôve decided to create a virtual machine, virtual energy. And when they create the energy in a proof of stake network or any other non-energy protocol, you‚Äôre not just getting rid of the electricity, you‚Äôre also getting rid of the material energy, which is the SHA-256 mining Asic. The application specific integrated circuit is matter, the electricity is energy. You‚Äôre limiting the matter and the energy, and the hardware‚Äôs important here, just as important as the energy because the electricity is a commodity. Michael Saylor (00:25:19): Whereas the thing that creates that makes this a specialty or makes it a scarcity, is the fact that you are modulating the energy through a SHA-256 mining chip and that mining chip is special purpose. That‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs not a general purpose chip, and it‚Äôs also getting exponentially more efficient. The genius of the Bitcoin protocol is that the hardware is proprietary, there‚Äôs no other use for it, and it gets exponentially better over time, such that the energy efficiency of the network is improving with Moore‚Äôs Law and with the having protocol. That makes this an increasingly efficient security protocol, and it protects the protocol from someone that has a huge amount of commodity computing power or a huge amount of electricity power. It doesn‚Äôt matter that you build a fusion reactor that generates thousands of terawatts because it‚Äôs not the pure electricity that secures the network, it‚Äôs the encrypted energy. It‚Äôs the SHA-256 hashes that secure the network. If it was only the electricity, it would be vulnerable to an attack from someone that harnessed the power of the sun. Preston Pysh (00:26:41): I think what you‚Äôre talking about is one of these questions that I have coming up here, and I‚Äôm going to just read this because I think it ties into what you‚Äôre saying here. In 2017, the World Economic Forum posted an article that said by 2020, the Bitcoin mining could consume the same amount of electricity every year as is currently used by the entire world. This is the World Economic Forum just a couple years ago. Well, as we know, that calculation was grossly misstated, but that doesn‚Äôt stop other experts from still stating such salacious headlines right now that we‚Äôre seeing in 2022. What is it that these experts fail to understand about Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption that I think you‚Äôre getting at with what you were just talking about? Michael Saylor (00:27:20): I think what they‚Äôre missing is that the efficiency, that network is improving with Moore‚Äôs Law exponentially. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre missing. The other day, I walked through one of these Newport mansions and now you can actually download a mobile app to your phone and then you can download the audio for, and you can listen to the tour guide using AirPods, walking to a mansion in the year 2022. While I watched this, I‚Äôm downloading it and sometimes the audio tour is 80 megabytes and sometimes it‚Äôs 160 megabytes or something. Then I thought back to when I was at MIT when one of my classmates had a five megabyte hard drive or something, and if you simply took the effi‚Ä¶ Then I thought about the efficiency of audio in the 1980s, and you could have easily said, if people continue to use computer music or if Napster spreads computer music, by the year 2010, all of the hardware and all of the electricity in the world will be sucked up listening to rock and roll music. Michael Saylor (00:28:26): It would‚Äôve been true if you extrapolated the efficiency of music compression and the cost of hard drives, pretty much would‚Äôve said that we can‚Äôt allow teenagers to listen to music on a computing device because the world will come to an end. And you could have said the same thing about digital photos, if this keeps up, then teenage girls taking selfies will suck up all the electricity and all of the minerals in the earth‚Äôs crust by the year 20 something or other. And of course, what happens in all cases is the efficiency of computer music and the efficiency of storing files and the capacity of memory, the capacity of computer memory, the capacity of computer drives, these things are increasing exponentially, such that it turns out that people can listen to music on their phones and take photos, and the world doesn‚Äôt come to an end. Michael Saylor (00:29:23): And so when people make these statements about Bitcoin, what they‚Äôre doing is the same thing. They‚Äôre missing the point. It‚Äôs not secured by energy, it‚Äôs secured by digital energy or encrypted energy. And the efficiency with which that encryption is taking place is improving somewhere in the range of 36 to 40% a year. Ironically, Moore‚Äôs law is every 18 months to double. If you have an 18% improvement every year due to having protocol, and if you have an 18% improvement every year, because every four years the Asics double, okay, you got 36% a year. And when you start dividing that into 70 with a few twists, you realize in about 18 months, you double the efficiency of the network and you keep doing it for the first 30, 40, 50 years. Maybe you continue to do it for a long time to come. As of today, as far as we can see, we run the numbers. Michael Saylor (00:30:27): Bitcoin has taken up maybe 15 basis points of the world‚Äôs energy and it‚Äôs not clear to me that it‚Äôs going to grow that much more. At some point, it is some maximum, and it actually starts to decrease because the proprietary protocol is such that ultimately in the year 2100, it won‚Äôt matter whether you have harnessed all the power of a star, it won‚Äôt matter because that won‚Äôt allow you to build, to create hashes. I could give you all the electricity, the powers of New York City tomorrow, but you can‚Äôt generate hashes with it. And unless you can get your hands on 256 mining rigs, set them up in a world class mining center, get the transformers and turn it on, so you can see there‚Äôs already a limiting factor there. Michael Saylor (00:31:15): On the other side, if Google and Microsoft and Amazon, they all decided tomorrow they‚Äôre going to turn all of their data centers into Bitcoin mining data centers, their cost to generate a Bitcoin would probably be like a million dollars of coin and not $10 million of coin because they don‚Äôt have Asics, right? And the ASIC isn‚Äôt thousand times, it‚Äôs million times more efficient. It‚Äôs this specialization of labor, the driving of the tractor is a better idea than a hand plow, right? In every field of human endeavor, everything humans put their mind to, we find when we create a specialized machine and then we power that specialized machine, then we overcome any generalist who‚Äôs willing‚Ä¶ Michael Saylor (00:32:00): Then we overcome any generalist who‚Äôs well intentioned. I toured the DuPont gunpowder factories. The DuPonts showed up. They set up a factory on a hill where the Brandywine River runs down it. And the reason they wanted this creek is they had to harness the creek for hydro power to turn their water wheel to turn the mills to grind the gun powder. Michael Saylor (00:32:26): And so, here are some smart immigrants. They use the power of gravity, the power of water. Then they mix three elements together. They create gun powder. They hand you the gun powder and you blow your way through the mountain. Okay. Michael Saylor (00:32:41): And someone starts by saying, ‚ÄúI have this idea. I‚Äôm going to build tunnels through mountains.‚Äù And some non-technologist says, ‚ÄúNo, no, no. We can never build tunnels through mountains that will take every single human being in the world and we will all starve to death because it‚Äôs too expensive using our little rubber mallets or our little chisels to chisel our way through the mountains.‚Äù Preston Pysh (00:33:04): Exactly. Michael Saylor (00:33:04): Right. And the point is, we‚Äôre not doing it that way. We‚Äôre going to use our brains and technology. If you actually back calculate, someone says, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm going to connect San Francisco to New York.‚Äù And you back calculate, well, how much energy is it going to take to haul a bucket of water on my back 10 million times? Well, we can‚Äôt do that because the human race will suffocate trying to connect New York and San Francisco. Michael Saylor (00:33:32): And then if you calculate what it costs to build the railroad, you would conclude it‚Äôs too much. And if you calculate the maintenance cost on wooden rails, that‚Äôs too much. And the answer is, I invent explosives, I invent steel. I come up with some technique to get through, then I create a locomotive. Then I go and I drill for oil, then I put the oil into the locomotive. Then I drive the train back and forth. Michael Saylor (00:33:58): Every single one of those things would have used all of the energy in the world, if you were to attempt. We can‚Äôt give public transportation to people, that will use all the energy. All the ox carts in the world will be allocated to letting people commute back into work. We can‚Äôt let them live in the suburbs. Preston Pysh (00:34:19): Michael, this is hard for, I think for a lot of people to wrap their head around because the examples you‚Äôre providing are physical examples that people can relate to. And it makes sense to them when you describe it in that way. But when you think about ASICs and you think about Moore‚Äôs Law and you think about how these things that people can‚Äôt touch or really understand at the level that you understand and that many people in this space understand, it‚Äôs just completely lost on them. It‚Äôs intangible. It‚Äôs not something they can feel or touch. Michael Saylor (00:34:49): Yeah. Bitcoin miner is, it‚Äôs a machine to create security in cyberspace. That‚Äôs what it is. You have to see it as a mechanism. Preston Pysh (00:34:59): Like a digital vault. A digital vault if you will. Is that how you‚Äôd describe it? Michael Saylor (00:35:03): I would almost describe it as a transmitter of encrypted energy. It creates a wall of encrypted energy. You‚Äôre feeding electricity into one end and out the other end comes a hash wall. And then you‚Äôre building‚Ä¶ Preston Pysh (00:35:19): Like a bank vault. Like a bank vault, but virtual. Right? Michael Saylor (00:35:22): Yeah, that‚Äôs probably‚Ä¶ An energy vault. You‚Äôre putting electricity in and you‚Äôre creating a vault of encrypted energy. And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre using to build as your foundation to build civilization in cyberspace. Like I said. And a lot of people can‚Äôt figure it out. They can‚Äôt work it out. But you ever cross a bridge and you look down at the caissons or the structures the bridges are built on. And the bridge is resting on these, what are they? Caissons I suppose. Resting on these structures. And they‚Äôre buried 30 feet down into the East River or the Hudson River. Michael Saylor (00:35:59): And the average person can‚Äôt figure out how to create that bridge. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that the bridge doesn‚Äôt work. In this particular case, I see the Bitcoin miners as the foundation to hold up the entire digital ecosystem. And we‚Äôre feeding them electricity and then we‚Äôre running them through an ASIC. And the ASICs just keep getting more and more efficient. Michael Saylor (00:36:20): And just like you take a history of civil engineering and you look at Greek architecture and they‚Äôre using stone architraves. Those things crack. And then they replace them with some wooden beams and they crack. And then they come up with the idea of a truss. And a truss creates this, dramatically increases the strength of the beams. And now things stop cracking. Michael Saylor (00:36:44): And that works well for a while. And then they come up with arches and then buttresses. And of course, ultimately, they solve the problem when they figure out how to put enough energy into iron to create steel. Iron works and steel works and steel is a material energy. It‚Äôs a massively dense energy. And if you want to build structures, you have to create the steel. I think about a steel refinery and I think about how much energy goes into the refining of steel and the heat and the energy. And then you think about what comes out. And then, if you want to build any structure in the world, that steel is the material to build that structure. Michael Saylor (00:37:23): Bitcoin miners are energy refiners in a way. And what they spit out is digital energy. They not only create it, but they secure it. You can also think of them as supporting the railroad in cyberspace. It‚Äôs a railroad. And there‚Äôs a fixed cost to build the railroad and there‚Äôs a fixed cost to maintain the railroad when something breaks. But once you‚Äôve got the railroad and it‚Äôs properly maintained, now the cost to move tons of cargo from one end of the line to the other in the line has decreased, not by a factor of 10 or a factor 100. It‚Äôs probably decreased by a factor of 10,000 to 100,000. It might have decreased by a factor of a million, if you want, you did the energy calculations. Michael Saylor (00:38:10): Try to move 80 tons of coal from New York to Chicago in one day without the railroad, without the road on an ox cart. I mean it‚Äôs such a silly comparison. Because no one would ever think to do it because it‚Äôs almost impossible to do. But when we created the railroads, we created this extraordinarily expensive, upfront engineering project that required a lot of capital investment, very capital intensive. Michael Saylor (00:38:37): But then after you‚Äôve created it, then for a‚Ä¶ You‚Äôve got a moderate maintenance cost and then you get this super conducting effect where you‚Äôre able to move material. And it‚Äôs orders and orders of magnitude less cost. Preston Pysh (00:38:53): Michael, since Bretton Woods, when we go back in time, the world has become more digital than at that period of time, where you didn‚Äôt have these digital units representing energy and representing money. Our currencies have become digital. And with that, there appears to be a need for a technology to tie this virtual digital world to physical reality. Preston Pysh (00:39:14): If people are going to desire physical goods but keep virtual records, there needs to be a way to force virtual records to be immutable. Do you see this as the crux of the energy debate? Do you see this as the crux of the environmental situation that we see playing out? And I know those are two very big and separate, maybe not separate, but two separate questions. But I‚Äôm curious how you think about this. Michael Saylor (00:39:41): Yeah, I think the best way to break it down is in two areas. With regard to currency and digital currency, the problem we have right now is, although the world wants to be digital, there is no digital money. There is only digital credit. Remember when I said money without energy is credit. And so, right now, what you have is credit circulating on the digital network. And the credit is got a first order failing and a second order failing. The first order failing is the credit card network where the settlement is slow once a month or something. The settlement is censored and it‚Äôs crippled. I can‚Äôt settle between France and Nigeria or between Argentina and China. I can‚Äôt settle between the US and China. And you can‚Äôt settle with three, four, 5 billion people that aren‚Äôt on your credit network. Michael Saylor (00:40:37): The first order problem is the settlement is just crippled and it is slow and it is expensive. My transaction will go through a third of the time to a third of the world for two and a half percent fee with a one month delay. After lots and lots of expensive engineering to get the systems to work together and after lots of expensive KYC, AML and compliance issues. That‚Äôs the first order problem with circulating credit. Michael Saylor (00:41:10): And the second order problem is the underlying asset, the euro, the dollar, the peso. They‚Äôre credit and they‚Äôre not backed by energy, which means that they‚Äôre all lapsing in energy content anywhere from 10% a year, to 50% a year, to 90% a year. Over time, the entire system is collapsing because there‚Äôs no energy backing it. And it‚Äôs neither a commodity, nor is it a scarcity. It‚Äôs not a commodity because any politician can decide to print as much as they want whenever they want so it‚Äôs just political money. It‚Äôs not a scarcity because it‚Äôs not totally capped. Michael Saylor (00:41:49): It‚Äôs really just mismanaged credit on the base layer with 20th century inefficient banking on the transaction layer. And so that itself is a structural problem. And we can leave that for a moment. I mean, Bitcoin solves that problem by substituting. Bitcoin is the base layer and Lightning as the transaction layer. Michael Saylor (00:42:10): And now you go from a velocity of one transaction a month to one transaction a millisecond. You‚Äôre increasing velocity by a factor of 10 million. You‚Äôre decreasing impedance transaction fee by a factor of 10 million. You‚Äôre converting the coupon into a commodity, upgrading it to a scarcity. You‚Äôre setting up an energy system that will hold money without energy lapse forever and will move it millions of times or billions of times more efficiently. And you‚Äôre making it open as opposed to permissionless. Michael Saylor (00:42:44): 8 billion people can access any kind of monetary transaction, friction free with instant final settlement. That‚Äôs why Bitcoin and Lightning or superior monetary system to fiat currency and credit cards and banks. Now we go to the energy side. The entire energy debate is interesting because I don‚Äôt really think bonafide energy activists are focused upon Bitcoin. I‚Äôm not even sure if there are bonafide energy activists to tell you the truth, Preston. And I think that the entire debate about energy usage has been corrupted and has always been corrupted by the political process and commercial interests. Preston Pysh (00:43:30): In what way? Michael Saylor (00:43:30): And so, I think in what you have is a bunch of‚Ä¶ Preston Pysh (00:43:31): Yeah. In what way? Michael Saylor (00:43:31): You have a bunch of propaganda that‚Äôs being driven by self-interested groups for either political or for commercial purposes that have generally very little to do with the environment. I might say, out of 100 people or actors that are acting in this bath, there might be one or two that actually are doing it because they actually believe this is an environmentally good thing, whatever they‚Äôre advocating. Michael Saylor (00:43:57): I think 95 to 98 are doing it because they‚Äôre being paid by someone to advocate a certain position. And so let me back up and let‚Äôs start with the classic example, the Jack Abramoff affair. If you want to know how lobbying works in DC. It used to be a bunch of people that are playing online poker. I‚Äôm very famous for an online poker quote I once said. I once said, ‚ÄúI think Bitcoin‚Äôs going the way of online poker, just a matter of time.‚Äù Michael Saylor (00:44:25): What I should have said, by the way is, ‚ÄúCrypto is going the way of online poker. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.‚Äù If I‚Äôd actually understand the nuance of Bitcoin versus crypto, I would‚Äôve said, ‚ÄúThe cryptos are probably going the way of online poker. Just a matter of time.‚Äù But here‚Äôs the online poker story. A bunch of people set up online poker, gambling sites. Everybody loves them, people like to play online. And it starts to cut into the earnings of a bunch of casinos, especially some Indian casinos. Michael Saylor (00:44:54): These India casinos are making a fortune because they‚Äôve been given a government license to allow gambling on their reservation. The Indians decide they want to stop online gambling. They go to DC and they hire a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff. This is all, they made a movie about this, Casino Jack. You can watch the movie, you can read the records. Michael Saylor (00:45:14): They give Abramoff tons of money, let‚Äôs say 20 million. Abramoff keeps half the money and he turns around and he gives the other half the money to a bunch of fundamentalist ministers, a variety of ministries. Now what do ministries have to do with Indian reservations? Well, he got the ministries to then go and they probably kept a third of the money. He took a third of the money and bought TV ads and he gave a third of the money to the ministers. And the ministers signed a letter and they put the letters in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, in the Washington Post and the like. Michael Saylor (00:45:47): And they said, ‚ÄúWe think online gambling is abomination of the eyes of God, it‚Äôs corrupting America‚Äôs youth. It‚Äôs not Christian, it‚Äôs corrupting.‚Äù The fundamentalists began lobbying against online gambling. They weren‚Äôt lobbying against gambling on Indian reservations or in Vegas, presumably maybe because Junior can‚Äôt get there from his bedroom, but he can‚Ä¶ I guess there‚Äôs some kind of, I argument that somehow it‚Äôs much more corrupting for America‚Äôs youth. You can do it online and you can play poker. Michael Saylor (00:46:17): You had a non-profit organization, seemingly unrelated organization, promote morals. Why did they choose to pursue improvement of morals by shutting down online gambling or online poker? Well, no one‚Äôs giving them money to object to other breaches in morality. There‚Äôs a customer here offering them money. And so they took the money, they signed the letter. Then Abramoff took the letters to Congress and he marched in front of a bunch of congressmen and senators. And they ended up passing a law making online poker playing illegal. Michael Saylor (00:46:50): Okay. They shut down online poker. People go back to the casinos and the Indian reservations. The casinos are happy. Inadvertently, it‚Äôs not really a debate about whether you should gamble. It‚Äôs a debate about whether or not you should give your gambling money to my competitor or you should do it in person. Michael Saylor (00:47:09): This idea, which is I have some money and then dirty money and I use it to corrupt the lobbyist. And then I actually find a non-profit. And the non-profit becomes my front organization to lobby the general public. And then I combine that with a bunch of donations to politicians. Now the politicians can‚Äôt just take my money from the Indians and outlaw their competitor. That looks bad. But the politicians can take money from everybody involved and say they‚Äôre outlawing the Indians casinos competitor because they want to protect America‚Äôs youth, is acceptable. Michael Saylor (00:47:43): Everybody gets paid, Abramoff gets paid, the politicians get reelected, they get paid, and the non-profit gets paid. Like an iron triangle. I think that‚Äôs been going on since time immemorial, for thousands of years. If you look at the nuclear industry, nuclear looks to be the cleanest, most efficient way to generate energy. And yet it was environmentalist, the Green Peaces of the world, that lobbied against the nuclear industry. Michael Saylor (00:48:11): Now why would they do that? Well, because nobody‚Äôs paying them money to lobby in favor of the third redwood tree. The redwood tree is not paying you money. If you‚Äôre lobbying in favor of ultimately no one‚Äôs going to pay you money to save the 19 millionth dolphin. But if somehow I happen to run a fishing operation and my competitor uses carbon fiber fishing javelins, then maybe I can give you money to lobby against the use of inhumane, cruel carbon fiber fishing javelins from these evil offshore people. Michael Saylor (00:48:49): And then I shut that down so I can fish the waters and they can‚Äôt fish the waters. Ultimately, what you find is the most common driver for all these narratives is someone has an agenda. And the agenda is either a foreign government, like your enemy, like a political enemy has an agenda. Or maybe a frenemy. Maybe a foreign government that trades with you has an agenda. Or a not in kind competitor to you has an agenda. Michael Saylor (00:49:20): With nuclear, ironically it was probably the oil and the gas industry that was paying off the non-profits to shut down the nuclear industry and they were very effective at that. We haven‚Äôt built a nuclear power plant in 50 years. Okay. Who‚Äôs lobbying to stop the creation of a pipeline in the US? Well, who would benefit? The Russians would benefit because they saw the oil. They have their own pipeline, so they might benefit, but also all the Middle Eastern countries would benefit. Michael Saylor (00:49:51): If you‚Äôre pumping oil out of the desert in the Middle East, you would benefit from a oil and gas pipeline getting shut down in the US. our allies that produce the same product would actually benefit by having a non-profit organization fight for the rights of Indian Native American burial mounds. Michael Saylor (00:50:12): You remember all the arguments that were made to keep the pipeline going through in the US? It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre desecrating Native American burial grounds.‚Äù No, you need a Native American Indian to campaign for that. How do you do that while you go and you give them tons of money? What does everybody want? A job. Okay, so I will give you a job protesting or I‚Äôll give you a job restoring the Native American burial grounds. I happen to live in Asia and I own billions of barrels of oil, but I‚Äôve decided to take a special interest in restoring Native American burial grounds that happen to be in the 10 square mile radius that the pipeline‚Äôs going across. Michael Saylor (00:50:52): Now, I‚Äôve got a non-profit, I‚Äôve got a local interest, I funnel the money quietly. Now it becomes an embarrassment for the local politicians. What happens is maybe that campaign works and now they shut down the pipeline, which creates a net shortage of 10 billion barrels of oil that they have to buy from somebody else. But the price of oil goes up and the competitor sells it. Michael Saylor (00:51:18): Ironically, it might be an foreign intelligence. If I was a hostile nation state and I wanted to undermine my enemy, I would want them not to build ports, not to build infrastructure, not to build refineries, and not to have oil and not to build nuclear power plants. It might be in foreign intelligence. They have plenty of money and the motive. It might be just a friendly trading partner in Europe or the Middle East. Michael Saylor (00:51:46): Remember, it used to be we have these campaigns against child labor. Okay. Well, if the child labor is your 16 year old kid working at McDonald‚Äôs, no one much cares. But if the child labor is 16 year old working in a shoe factory in Indonesia. And that‚Äôs competing against maybe another factory in the US or another factory not in Indonesia, then maybe I want to actually campaign for the rights of child laborers. And the way that I‚Äôm going to help the children in Indonesia is I‚Äôm going to make it illegal to buy from that factory so they all lose their jobs and their parents lose their jobs and they all starve to death. Michael Saylor (00:52:23): But no one‚Äôs going to think about that. They‚Äôre going to be thinking about whatever the issue is. The classic trope, propaganda is you can‚Äôt tell people what to think, but you can tell them what to think about. My agenda is to shut down a foreign import. I can‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúStop buying from my competitor that‚Äôs cheaper and better than me.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúStop buying from that vendor that‚Äôs unethical, that uses child labor.‚Äù Preston Pysh (00:52:51): Michael, so a lot of this granularity that you‚Äôre getting into is I think an area that people probably have never really considered. Let‚Äôs say that you have a person who‚Äôs looking at the environmental narrative that is hot and heavy, ESG. Hot and heavy right now. I have a hard time even going down that path because it seems like the world, and if you buy into this environmental discussion point that people are making, that they candidly believe in, I‚Äôm of the opinion that they haven‚Äôt gone far enough upstream to, if the money is in sound, how in the world can we possibly expect the efficiency and optimization of producers and consumers to take place? Preston Pysh (00:53:42): It‚Äôs like this unit that we‚Äôre using in order to conduct trade amongst each other is so mutilated and so distorted that how can we possibly expect it to happen efficiently? And then you‚Äôre going to have over consumption if you have all these digital units that have no peg or no scarcity to them. Is that where we should start when we‚Äôre thinking about energy and environmental impact? Michael Saylor (00:54:04): I think all the ESG fund is originated by and promulgated by the other cryptos. This starts within the crypto industry and it is a fire set by the crypto industry. And so, the whole basis is Bitcoin is bad because it uses energy and we have a better tool that doesn‚Äôt use energy using proof of stake. And it‚Äôs a not in kind propaganda campaign or marketing campaign. Call it gorilla marketing. This is all just gorilla marketing by other crypto promoters. Michael Saylor (00:54:35): And the motive is I want to convince you that you should consider a crypto other than Bitcoin that doesn‚Äôt use energy. And also, I want to distract you from the observation that the other cryptos without energy or unregistered securities and therefore, you can‚Äôt trade them. And you shouldn‚Äôt buy them. It‚Äôs not ethical to promote them. Michael Saylor (00:54:55): I want to change the subject. There really is no defense to creating a software company and issuing a coupon and selling to the general public without a registration statement. It isn‚Äôt morally defensible. It isn‚Äôt legally defensible. You can‚Äôt start by saying, ‚ÄúI want to do it. Please let me do it.‚Äù What you say is, ‚ÄúThat thing you‚Äôre looking at is interesting, but it‚Äôs using too much energy and our thing does the same but without energy.‚Äù And they hope you don‚Äôt think too much beyond that. Michael Saylor (00:55:29): I think you can approach this from two points. But one point is you can make the deep argument that you need sound money. And the problem with that is you have to explain to people this sound money requires energy and it actually requires scarcity, requires more than energy. Gold is not sound money because of all the other defects in gold. It‚Äôs just better than the other stuff. Gold is a commodity. What you really want is scarcity for sound money. You can go down that path, but ultimately, the crypto attack is, ‚ÄúYeah, but we can create our own token without any energy and it‚Äôs just as good and it‚Äôs just as secure.‚Äù And so now, and so you really have to go the other direction, which is to make the observation that if you take the energy out of the coin, you‚Äôve created a coupon. And if you take the energy out of the coin, it‚Äôs not money, it‚Äôs credit. And if you take the energy out of the coin, it‚Äôs not a commodity, it‚Äôs a security. And therefore, the only question is how are you going to inject the energy? You can inject the energy into the coin with multiple protocols. You can do it with Satoshi‚Äôs protocol. You can inject the energy into the coin with the Doge coin protocol. You can do it with big blocks, small blocks. There‚Äôs plenty of other protocols. You don‚Äôt need to use SHA-256, but you can‚Äôt avoid putting energy into the product if you want to create something of substance. Michael Saylor (00:57:03): I think it doesn‚Äôt hurt to explain the theory of money and the theory of economics and Austrian economics, and why we‚Äôre doomed if we don‚Äôt have sound money. It doesn‚Äôt hurt. But ultimately, most people that are looking at cryptos and they‚Äôre trying to figure out between Bitcoin and all other proof of state coins, they‚Äôre definitely not thinking deeply about Austrian economics or sound money. They‚Äôre just juggling six different tokens. And they‚Äôre probably not considering this for more than 10 minutes to an hour. Michael Saylor (00:57:34): And so, in their case, I think the real challenge is to explain to them why there‚Äôs a moral hazard and an economic hazard and a technical hazard to take the energy out of the crypto network. The economic hazard is when the energy disappears, it‚Äôs easy to spin up 10,000 copycat networks. The real problem is once you go to proof of stake, well the what‚Äôs to keep you from making copies, endless copies of all these networks because you‚Äôre running on generic hardware using imaginary energy. Michael Saylor (00:58:09): How many teams of eight programmers can copy and paste and then spin up an AWS node or set up nodes and gen up their own system. We have 20,000 cryptos now, so there‚Äôs no scarcity. And ultimately, the economic hazard is they‚Äôll be 50. And then they‚Äôll all just chew into each other‚Äôs monetary premium and then there‚Äôll be 100, then 1,000 and the like. Michael Saylor (00:58:33): And so, there‚Äôs no way that it will hold value because there‚Äôs no scarcity when you take the energy out of it. It becomes a marketing game. It‚Äôs really a casino chips or coupons. And you‚Äôll be limited to the value that you can create in a coupon network or a security network, which is two orders of magnitude less than a monetary network. That‚Äôs the economic hazard. Michael Saylor (00:58:59): The technical hazard, The technical hazard to not using hardware with electricity, not using those two forms of energy, is that you have to create a simulation. And what you‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôre creating a virtual world. And in the virtual world, you have to simulate everything people might want to do. And it turns out that playing God by creating a simulation of the world is really difficult. For example, you can turn off your Bitcoin mining rig. It‚Äôs decentralized. ETH hasn‚Äôt figured out how to withdraw your ETH stake token yet. Preston Pysh (00:59:32): Yeah. Which is crazy. Which is crazy. Michael Saylor (00:59:36): And by the way, it might not be that they haven‚Äôt figured out. It might be they don‚Äôt wish to. Preston Pysh (00:59:40): Yeah. I think that‚Äôs where that‚Äôs at. Yes. Michael Saylor (00:59:44): The technical hazard is I have to have the purge and the surge and the verge. And I‚Äôve got pretty much a decade worth of programming yet to do. I‚Äôve got to implement slashing. And you‚Äôve got slashing and charting and withdrawals and staking and all these things. And you‚Äôve got to deal with a question of, ‚ÄúWell, what if someone does this? And what if they do that? And what if they do this?‚Äù Michael Saylor (01:00:04): That‚Äôs very expensive. That creates a lot of technical debt, it creates very complicated code. And because it creates very complicated code, it creates very large tax surfaces. From a computer science point of view, a lot of security threats to it. But from a maintenance point of view, there‚Äôs a lot of technical debt and you have all these regressions. Michael Saylor (01:00:23): Every time you add a feature, you break two things. And I know this because I‚Äôm actually in a business. There aren‚Äôt that many people that have overseen the same software for 30 years. MicroStrategy software, we were coding it in 1993. And so, we have some code, and ‚Äô92, ‚Äô93, with some ideas there that now they‚Äôre approaching the 30th year. And I can say that after you‚Äôve had some software and you‚Äôre 30 years in and you‚Äôre the sixth generation of engineers, the 13th version, you add a feature and you break something. And you add a feature and you break two things. Michael Saylor (01:01:01): You end up spending as much time on regression and technical debt, and then you have to go back and rearchitect the entire thing to make progress. And these are just extraordinarily expensive rearchitecting exercises. And you have this entropy and you reach this entropic frontier. And it just gets to be really, really challenging. That‚Äôs a technical risk. Michael Saylor (01:01:24): If you live in a universe where the laws of thermodynamics hold, there‚Äôs a rate at which heat dissipates everywhere in the world. And you don‚Äôt have to write a piece of software to tell Bitcoin miners how to dissipate heat. And you don‚Äôt have to write a piece of software to apply gravity and apply the speed of light. You get that for free. Michael Saylor (01:01:45): In a virtual world, you have to actually write the software to control things like speed of light and speed of sound and heat dissipation and gravity and materials coefficients. And what you find is it‚Äôs not so easy for a small group of engineers to duplicate what the universe worked out over the last 4 billion years. You‚Äôre literally playing God and you forgot one thing. Preston Pysh (01:02:11): Yeah, go ahead. Michael Saylor (01:02:12): And the one thing blows you up. Bitcoin, because it‚Äôs working in the physical world, it absorbs all of the physical constants in the universe. And everything works in parallel at the speed of light. Whereas in a staking network, you have to create a simulated world where you have to simulate all these constants and you have to enforce your own concept of time. Michael Saylor (01:02:35): And when you attempt to create a decentralized world in software, you‚Äôve bitten off probably more than you can chew. If you get everything perfectly right, then it may work for a time. But of course, if you actually just overlook one thing. And who knows what that one thing is? It only takes one mistake in the code to bring it all crashing down on your head. And of course, when it crashes down on your head, the entire universe collapses on you. It‚Äôs a very challenging task. And so that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs technical hazard. Michael Saylor (01:03:09): The one last point I wanted to make is, in addition to the economic hazard and the technical hazard, there‚Äôs the moral hazard. And the moral hazard is when you choose to create something that‚Äôs a simulated universe and virtual security on a virtual machine, you have to have a very organized software development function. And generally, you‚Äôve created the software development company. Michael Saylor (01:03:31): And the software developers have the ability to‚Ä¶ If they have the ability to slash or to grant permission or deny access. Or for example, to let you withdraw your tokens are not. At that point the software company has become so central to the network that you‚Äôve created a security. It becomes an investment contract per the definition of securities law because you are relying on the efforts of others. And it‚Äôs pretty much impossible not to rely on the efforts of others when you require software- Michael Saylor (01:04:00): Rely on the efforts of others when you require software engineers to make the sun shine, and make the planets to revolve around the sun, and enforce gravity and the like. Even if they didn‚Äôt want to, if you finish it, eventually they‚Äôre subject to nation state attack. The government shows up and says, ‚ÄúYou have to do this, block that.‚Äù You have to make it impossible to spend the coupons in China, or you‚Äôre not allowed to spend the coupons in Russia. Now you‚Äôre jiggering with the universe. Now imagine if I was able to stop gravity in Russia, or if I was able to make it impossible to eat oranges in China. Well, they wouldn‚Äôt be commodities, right? The universe wouldn‚Äôt work if one software engineer has that kind of power. The real problem with a virtual universe and a virtual network is ultimately the power concentrates in the hands of the software engineers, and inadvertently you‚Äôve created an investment contract, and you‚Äôre relying on a software company and the token becomes equity in a software company. Michael Saylor (01:05:08): There‚Äôs an ethical way to sell equity in a software company. It‚Äôs been done by Oracle and by Microsoft, but you see it requires registration statements and a whole set of other disclosures, and that‚Äôs not in the crypto ecosystem. They can‚Äôt really afford to do that. That‚Äôs why energy, a la Bitcoin, is the superior approach, and maybe the only approach that we know of for solving the problem of sound money. Preston Pysh (01:05:36): Michael, what you‚Äôre talking about there with this virtual reality universe constant, I think is such a profound idea, and it‚Äôs such a profound idea especially for policy makers. If there‚Äôs policy makers out there listening to this anywhere in the world, they‚Äôre being fed narratives from this perverted incentive structure that you so eloquently covered, from all these other protocols that are out there, specifically proof of stake protocols. No proof of stake protocol is bigger than this announcement that was recently made with the merge and Ethereum. I‚Äôm about to play, I‚Äôm going to play you a clip from Vitalik Buterin who‚Äôs the, whatever you want to refer to him as, the CEO of [inaudible 01:06:19]. But here‚Äôs the clip of him talking about something that completely relates to what you were just describing in detail, Michael, with respect to virtual constants. Vitalik Buterin (01:06:32): I think to summarize that, one of the ways that I think about this in a more philosophical way is proof of work is based on the laws of physics and so you sort of have to work with the world as it is. You have to work with electricity as it is, hardware as it is, what computers are as it is. Whereas because proof of stake is virtualized in this way, it‚Äôs basically letting us create a simulated universe that has its own laws of physics. That just gives us as protocol developers a lot more freedom to optimize the system around actually having all of the different security properties that we want. If we want the system to have a particular security guarantee, and then often there is a way to modify the [inaudible 01:07:16] mechanism to also achieve it. It‚Äôs just much more flexible and it shows through in the efficiency and the security of the network. Preston Pysh (01:07:26): Michael, what are your thoughts? Michael Saylor (01:07:29): Giving the protocol developers the freedom to optimize the system as they wish is what makes it a security and not a commodity. The whole reason that it doesn‚Äôt work is because you‚Äôve got us. Who does us refer to right? In the entire [inaudible 01:07:47]? Presumably us refers to a small group or a defined group of protocol developers that are tinkering with the code in order to make the universe the way they want it to be. That makes it a software company and that makes ETH an investment contract and that makes every ETH investor reliant upon the efforts of others. That throws into a bunch of questions, which is, there‚Äôs so many different problems with this. Michael Saylor (01:08:16): One problem is you‚Äôre implying that you‚Äôre going to get one group of software engineers to write software to simulate the entire universe. Good luck with that. But the second problem is if one group of software engineers did write the software, that makes it a investment contract. The only way for it to be a commodity is you have to have dozen different groups of software engineers without coordination bouncing into each other randomly agreeing on some software code that simulates the universe after lots of bitter dissent without any one of them able to take a leadership role. Michael Saylor (01:08:55): You think about it and you just think, where to even start? If you found the hundred smartest scientists in the world that ever lived and you put them on the team to write the code, it would be a security and that would be an investment contract, and it‚Äôs not a commodity. But if you found the not a hundred smartest people, they‚Äôd probably screw it up. You probably can‚Äôt write software that simulates the universe. It‚Äôs not so easy to do it perfectly for a billion years, even for a year. Michael Saylor (01:09:28): Then the third problem is you just can‚Äôt have‚Ä¶ Vitalik implies that they‚Äôre just going to keep changing it whenever they wish for whatever reason they wish. Well, who appointed him God, and who appointed the ETH developers God? If the people that talk like that are software company CEOs, if you‚Äôre the CEO of a software company and you have the controlling interest in the shares, maybe you‚Äôre Mark Zuckerberg, you could say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to change the way Facebook works. It‚Äôs my way or the highway,‚Äù but it‚Äôs a security and he‚Äôs accountable to his public shareholders. The reason he can do it is because he runs the company, but if you‚Äôre actually promoting your crypto network as the commodity, nobody has the power to dictate what happens next, and certainly you shouldn‚Äôt be able to force that. Michael Saylor (01:10:20): If you can force your views onto the asset holders, then that doesn‚Äôt sound like consensus. If you can force your views on the Bitcoin, on the ETH miners, that doesn‚Äôt sound like consensus. The fact is, you have a situation where a small group of software engineers have hijacked a crypto network to their benefit to the detriment of the outsiders and the miners. It wasn‚Äôt a vote for sure. The ETH miners never would‚Äôve voted to convert to proof of stake. They weren‚Äôt given a vote. Preston Pysh (01:10:52): Which proves it‚Äôs decentralized. That‚Äôs the proof. Michael Saylor (01:10:57): Everybody with their ETH [inaudible 01:10:59] stakes is waiting to see how much they‚Äôll be diluted once the software developers decide, and everyone with their money staked is waiting to see whether they‚Äôll ever get it back once the developers decide. Now the question is, how do they decide who is we? Vitalik, he actually refers to us. Who is us? In a publicly traded company, you would have to file a registration statement and then you would disclose the management team, and the board, and you would disclose who has the voting stock. Any investor would actually would some idea of corporate governance, and you would also disclose all your risk factors. But in a commodity, none of those things are disclosed. Michael Saylor (01:11:40): If you have a situation where you have a small group of individuals that are actually writing software that determines whether another group of individuals make money or lose all their money, in theory, couldn‚Äôt the protocol developers just decide to never let you one stake and pay you no fee? They could. What are you going to do about it? What‚Äôs your ETH worth in that case? The staked ETH is worth nothing, right? Michael Saylor (01:12:08): On the other hand, they could do the opposite. They could say that the staked ETH is the only, no one else can stake anymore ETH, and you get paid 10% or 20% of a year in ETH, and then the non staked ETH goes to zero. You have a classic example of a small group of people that are basically playing God. You don‚Äôt even get around this by saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to take a vote.‚Äù Of course they don‚Äôt take a vote. If you took a vote, you‚Äôd be taking a shareholder vote. Corporations take votes. You‚Äôre still a security. Michael Saylor (01:12:38): The way that you actually get to be a commodity is you create something which no one can reasonably change without overwhelming universal consensus. Almost like, you could even say universal consensus. You want to change something? If I don‚Äôt change my node, you can‚Äôt force me to change the node. You can fork off, you can break off and do your own thing, but you can‚Äôt force me. You can‚Äôt reach in and stop me. That‚Äôs what makes it a commodity, the lack of governance. Michael Saylor (01:13:12): If you have a plan, if you have a roadmap, the fact that you have the power to implement the roadmap is what makes it a security. I think in Bitcoin, the difference between Bitcoin and ETH is, Vitalik would say ETH is only 40% finished and Bitcoin is 80% finished. That‚Äôs what he says. But if you ask the Bitcoin, they would say ‚ÄúNo, ETH may be 40% finished. It doesn‚Äôt look that finished to us, but it‚Äôs something finished, but bitcoin‚Äôs done.‚Äù Michael Saylor (01:13:42): Bitcoin was 100% finished on January 3rd, 2009. It was a complete protocol. The only thing that‚Äôs going to happen in Bitcoin is we‚Äôre going to fix a fatal bug, or if we have an overwhelming 100% consensus that we might want to create for [inaudible 01:14:02] with a [inaudible 01:14:02] or something, maybe we will. But that‚Äôs why Bitcoin has been all soft forks, no hard forks. You‚Äôre going to take four years or longer with a massive bitter debate over even an inconsequential soft fork, right? Because we would say Bitcoin is substantially done. I think there‚Äôs even a famous line, or maybe it was Satoshi that said, ‚ÄúThe nature of Bitcoin was such that it was, substantially the protocol was complete in the beta.‚Äù As soon as it went to beta, it was pretty much done. You weren‚Äôt going to change it. Michael Saylor (01:14:34): The idea that you can keep changing it and changing it, I think in Vitalik‚Äôs keynote speech, he had four more phases to go and each phase looks like two years, which means it‚Äôll stretch the three or four years, and each one has to be funded. Who‚Äôs going to pay for it? That‚Äôs interesting. Who‚Äôs going to pay for it? You almost get this sense that the miners all have to die so that the money that was going to go to the miners for hardware security or physical security can be redirected to the developers to add software. Michael Saylor (01:15:03): If you‚Äôve made the decision that you‚Äôre going to derive all of your security and integrity from software, then you‚Äôve made the decision to fund a software development effort at infant item, which means you‚Äôve made the decision to fund a software company. I don‚Äôt know how you fund one, but now imagine you‚Äôre going to launch six of them. How do you get six different independent software companies to do the same complicated thing and fight with each other over the next 10 to 20 years in order to be decentralized? Preston Pysh (01:15:33): You talk about perverted incentive structures like you were describing earlier with lobbying and things like that, I could only imagine what type of infighting could potentially cause a split in some of those incentives as you‚Äôre talking about a niche group of programmers that are working towards what update they personally want. You talk about the seniorage that‚Äôs doing the consensus as well, and the validation of a proof of stake system and how infighting and lobbying could play out so that it just gets consolidated more and more into the hands of the few because it‚Äôs not tethered to physical reality. Michael Saylor (01:16:09): Yeah, Bitcoin is on one handed an example of how to do it. Set the protocol January 3rd, 2009, don‚Äôt mess with it. Occasional soft forks to fix a fatal bug or something, but really don‚Äôt mess with it. Leave it well enough alone. The monetary protocol in a year 2140, we have every reason to believe is the same as the monetary protocol today and the monetary protocol in the year 2240 or 2340 or 2440, the same as today. I think ETH is the other extreme, which is we‚Äôre sitting here in the security protocol that‚Äôs a month old or a few weeks old. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen there. The monetary protocol is still not set. Michael Saylor (01:16:51): For example, what‚Äôs the staking yield? Nobody knows, right? What‚Äôs the staking yield for the next 120 years? We actually know what the Bitcoin mining reward structure is for the next 120 years. We have an algorithm to determine transaction fees for the next 20,000 years. We know that. We knew that on January 3rd, 2009. Hasn‚Äôt changed. That‚Äôs the monetary protocol of Bitcoin, capped to 21 million. Michael Saylor (01:17:16): The monetary protocol of ETH hasn‚Äôt been set yet. In fact, there‚Äôs not even a date by which it will be set yet. You don‚Äôt know if you can stake, you don‚Äôt know if you can unstake, you don‚Äôt know what the consequences are, and you‚Äôve got a never ending set of technical changes. Charting is just another feature set. What about slashing? You‚Äôve got all these questions. One could reasonably say Bitcoin is substantially complete. Well, Bitcoin was substantially complete January 3rd, 2009. Michael Saylor (01:17:52): Ethereum is substantially incomplete now. That fundamentally is the problem, and the challenge with Vitalik‚Äôs philosophy is this idea that we can simply imagine anything and do anything that we imagine is unhinged from reality. You really can‚Äôt just do anything that you want. Anybody that‚Äôs ever built software before knows you start with this idea of a cool feature and then you go down the path and then you realize that either you couldn‚Äôt get it to work or nobody wanted it, or it‚Äôs dysfunctional or backfires. I think Ethereum and all the proof of stake cryptos, generally all the cryptos, they‚Äôre very overly idealistic, and the idealism ultimately makes them inappropriate as money and makes them inappropriate as commodity. Preston Pysh (01:18:42): I think it‚Äôs important, so when you have policy makers that are hearing these debates and they‚Äôre getting swayed one way or the other, it‚Äôs very easy for people who don‚Äôt understand what Bitcoin is fundamentally trying to solve for. What is it fundamentally trying to solve for versus somebody who would look at an Ethereum and say, ‚ÄúYeah, but it does smart contracts and it does programmability on the base layer and it does all these other things.‚Äù When I hear that side by side, I immediately, in my brain, I‚Äôm saying that person does not understand what‚Äôs fundamentally broke and what‚Äôs fundamentally being solved for. Michael Saylor (01:19:19): Let‚Äôs boil it down to one idea. Bitcoin is attempting to be a digital asset without an issuer. The whole ethos of crypto properly understood is the creation of a digital asset without an issuer, and that idea, or aspiration has been achieved by Bitcoin. There‚Äôs a massive debate as to whether or not half a dozen or a dozen other networks have achieved it. We could debate that back and forth. But the other 20,000 are really just coupons running on software databases. The idea that I can do all these cool things without all the functionality, that‚Äôs called software. Smart contracts and the like are all available in software. They run in software. You can do them on web browsers and servers and iPhones using a very small amount of electricity, very little energy, and you can do them beautifully in software. There‚Äôs no innovation there. Michael Saylor (01:20:18): The innovation that‚Äôs really critical in crypto is the creation of an asset without an issuer. Whenever you default to have a software organization create that asset and essentially maintain it, you failed. You haven‚Äôt created a crypto, you‚Äôve created a software program. It may be a software program running on 20 computers instead of one computer, but you‚Äôre just creating a software program. And so therefore there‚Äôs no breakthrough there. The slight of hand here is somehow to say, ‚ÄúWell, Bitcoin is a digital asset without an issuer, and we‚Äôre sort of like Bitcoin, but we have a lot more features and don‚Äôt use electricity, so favor us.‚Äù Michael Saylor (01:20:59): But of course the logical fallacy is they‚Äôre nothing like Bitcoin because they‚Äôre not assets without issuers, they‚Äôre assets with issuers. The fact that Vitalik can actually say what they intend to do is proof that they‚Äôre not a decentralized network. A true crypto network doesn‚Äôt have anybody that can tell you what‚Äôs going to happen next. That‚Äôs why Satoshi disappeared. Preston Pysh (01:21:22): Michael, it‚Äôs not just that it has, and I‚Äôm assuming this is your opinion, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, it‚Äôs not that it just has this no issuer, it‚Äôs that it has no issuer with a terminal fixed supply that can never be based beyond that amount. That‚Äôs the game changing piece that solves the problem, which I want you to address what that problem is. Michael Saylor (01:21:43): Yeah, let‚Äôs talk about that. The creation of a crypto asset without an issuer is the innovation. Bitcoin is one step beyond that. If you create a digital asset without an issuer, you‚Äôve created a commodity, a digital commodity, but you haven‚Äôt created digital money or digital scarcity. If you want to create the perfect digital money, you don‚Äôt just want a commodity. Remember stock to flow? Preston Pysh (01:22:12): Yeah. Michael Saylor (01:22:13): Silver is a commodity that makes bad money. Bales of tobacco and seashells and glass beads are commodities that make crappy money. Gold is a commodity that makes better money because it‚Äôs got a higher stock to flow ratio. Bitcoin is a commodity that makes the best money because the stock to flow ratio is infinite. In essence, it‚Äôs 21 million. We know where it ends. It‚Äôs completely capped, completely scarce. Those coin may or may not be a digital commodity, I‚Äôm not sure because I‚Äôd have to determine whether or not it was ethically launched and whether or not it was truly decentralized, and whether or not there‚Äôs anyone that has true influence over it. I can honestly say I haven‚Äôt studied it enough to know whether it is or isn‚Äôt. Preston Pysh (01:23:01): Neither have I. Michael Saylor (01:23:03): But let‚Äôs say hypothetically you forked some Bitcoin code, but then you change some of the code to remove the having. Well then would‚Äôve a digital asset that you might be able to argue is a commodity. If you forked it, gave it to the world, disappeared, and it ran like Bitcoin, but without the havings, then it would simply continue to inflate at whatever, 3, 4% a year, X percent a year, forever. Now that‚Äôs a commodity, but it‚Äôs not a scarcity. It‚Äôs weak money. It‚Äôs not hard money, it‚Äôs weaker money. You could make an ethical argument that you should be able to trade in on a crypto exchange without filing a registration statement. Michael Saylor (01:23:55): The thing that‚Äôs missing right now is the ability to actually apply to the CFTC or the SEC and submit your crypto network and say, ‚ÄúThis token should be deemed a commodity.‚Äù But let‚Äôs say that they‚Äôve already agreed Bitcoin is a commodity. There‚Äôs nobody to apply because it‚Äôs so decentralized that there‚Äôs no one left, but that I could just take the protocol and submit it and I could say, ‚ÄúLook, no one has the power to change it. The protocol hasn‚Äôt substantially changed in years and years and years. Is this commodity?‚Äù They would probably say yes. I don‚Äôt see an issuer. There‚Äôs no ICO, there‚Äôs no pre mine, there‚Äôs no one that seems to have it. Michael Saylor (01:24:32): Satoshi, looks like Satoshi mined a lot of coins, but they haven‚Äôt moved and Satoshi‚Äôs gone. So yeah, it looks like commodity. Now, if I forked it, if I forked Bitcoin the year 2022 and I removed the havings and bitcoin‚Äôs‚Ä¶ and this is Bitcoin lite or weak coin, we‚Äôll call it. Weak coin, or maybe it‚Äôs minor coin because some minor decides it‚Äôs a good idea because their block rewards will just stay constant. I can create minor coin, M-I-N-E-R or M-I-N-O-R, depending on which one [inaudible 01:25:10]. Miner coin, and I fork that and I submit that application to the CFTC and I say, ‚ÄúLook, this is this. There‚Äôs like 27 minors that are mining miner coin. Is this a security or commodity?‚Äù If I did in a fair and equitable fashion, it would be a digital asset without an issuer, because you‚Äôre allowed to do a little bit of sulfur engineering. Michael Saylor (01:25:35): You can copy and paste the code, change having line, and again, issue it to the public domain. You‚Äôre just not allowed to give yourself an ICO, give yourself 20% of the supply, sell 20% to the general. You can‚Äôt sell 20% to the general public, keep 20%, and then keep control of the protocol and then call it a commodity, you see? In this particular case, the miner achievement, which we should recognize as an achievement, is the creation of a digital commodity, but the brilliant achievement, the brilliant achievement is the creation of a digital scarcity. Michael Saylor (01:26:15): What you just said is right in a way, that is Satoshi‚Äôs genius is creating digital scarcity, a digital commodity without an issuer, but the thing that makes it scarce is the protocol. You can create‚Ä¶ the protocol. Another way to say it is not all digital commodities are equally good, just like not all commodities are really good. Just like copper versus silver versus gold, they‚Äôre all commodities. One is harder than the other. Michael Saylor (01:26:47): You can have a superior protocol or an inferior protocol. What I would say with Bitcoin is, and what I would say with crypto is, you have to have energy, a proprietary energy, to create the decentralized secure network that creates a commodity or creates an asset with an issuer. You need that. You have some choices in the software protocol. [inaudible 01:27:11] every six years instead of every four years. Like choices, you have choices in the hardware. Well, actually not. I‚Äôll take that back. The hardware, you have choices how you build the hardware, but anybody can build any hardware they want. Michael Saylor (01:27:23): The Shaw 256 protocol, which is a software decision, determined the hardware that followed, and now people are creating hardware optimized for that software. The genetic code was set. There are other genetic codes that could result in digital assets without an issuer. There are also other genetic codes. There are other software protocols that could result in digital assets without an issuer that are also scarce. You could create a Bitcoin copy that‚Äôs capped to 21 million coins, but the difficulty adjustment takes place every four weeks instead of every two weeks, and having takes place every five years instead of every four years. It would still be a scarcity, but it‚Äôll be a different network, a different protocol. Would one be better than the other? Maybe it‚Äôs like single cell organisms. There‚Äôs that bacteria and this bacteria, and they kind of look the same to all of us, but one of the bacterias is better than the other bacteria when it comes to fighting for survival. Michael Saylor (01:28:26): I think what we have is Bitcoin is a digital asset without an issuer that happens to be a digital scarcity and a digital commodity. There‚Äôs a question as to how many other digital commodities or scarcities there are. There is no process in the regulatory system for having something formally designated a digital commodity. The presumption is most things are securities until proven otherwise. The observation is most of them look like securities because they have CEOs and management teams and BC and ICOs and airdrop and pre mines and all sorts of indicia of investment contracts. Preston Pysh (01:29:08): Michael, when I look at the problem that it‚Äôs solving, if I was going to quantify what problem I think it is, I would probably state it like this. Bitcoin is solving the breakdown in fiat currency, A fiat currency that has been manipulated for decades on end, and has now created a head bashing between net exporters and net importers around the world where the net exporters don‚Äôt want to be paid in these credit-based fiat paper promises because they‚Äôve been manipulated down to nothing percent. But the net consumers insist on paying in these paper promises. Bitcoin steps in as a wedge between these two importers or net exporters and net consumers, and solves the unit of account that they cannot come to agreement on for their settlement. Do you agree with that? Do you see it differently? Do you think I‚Äôm using a word sandwich to describe the problem? Can you describe the problem more simply than that? What are your thoughts? Michael Saylor (01:30:23): I agree with what you said, and I agree on the dilemma. I can‚Äôt help but remember going Parabolics phrase hard money, you can‚Äôt F with. Preston Pysh (01:30:33): Jason Williams, the shout out. Michael Saylor (01:30:36): Yeah, go Jason. Hard money you can‚Äôt F with. I think Bitcoin, it‚Äôs hard money, right? We‚Äôre moving into a world where the credibility of the fiat currencies are collapsing. My fiat currency has been money since, I mean maybe it‚Äôs been money since 1914. I mean, we could debate. We had a goal standard 1865, 1914. Then we had a goal reserve standard until 1971, and then we just had pure fiat. We‚Äôve had some flavor of fiat, but I guess the trust in fiat since 1971 has been decaying at some progressive rate. Michael Saylor (01:31:17): Now we‚Äôve reached a point where we have an unprecedented crisis of confidence or loss in confidence, and we see it in the collapse of the euro, the yen, the pound against the dollar. We see it in the collapse of developing world currencies against the dollar. We see it in the breakdown of world trade. There‚Äôs between‚Ä¶ all sorts of blocks, there‚Äôs a problem of trade between the Chinese and the Indians and the Russians and the Americans and the like. Hence a re-embracing of commodities, and it seems like people want commodity backed money. Michael Saylor (01:31:52): The dilemma that the world has is it needs two things. It needs a monetary asset and it also needs a monetary network. In the age of gold, the monetary asset was a bar of gold and the monetary network was move it on a ship or a plane or a train, probably more than likely a train or a ship, no planes really. That was the old world. And then the last hundred years have been this intermediate period where the monetary asset was substantially the dollar. From 1918 on, the pound was secondary, but for the most part the dollar and the banking system was the network or the central banking system has been the network for that time period. Michael Saylor (01:32:38): Now the world wants a new monetary network. We have an economic problem, we have a technical problem, we have a political problem. The technical problem is 8 billion people need to be able to do transactions 10,000 times a day with each other over 50 billion computers. That‚Äôs a technical problem. You could solve that with Bitcoin plus layer two and layer three protocols. But you need money that moves at the speed of light with final settlement in a milli a second. We don‚Äôt have that through the 20th century. You don‚Äôt have it with the central banks, the correspondent banks, and the credit card networks. You just don‚Äôt have it. That‚Äôs a technical problem. Michael Saylor (01:33:19): The economic problem is that all the fiat currencies are losing purchasing power and they‚Äôre collapsing. If they‚Äôre collapsing at, right now, it looks like they‚Äôre collapsing between 10 and 20% a year in total. The world reserve currency, the dollar was collapsing at 7% a year for about a hundred years. We managed to live through the 7% a year, but I don‚Äôt think we can live through the 15 to 21% a year. The rate of collapse is just accelerated, and in some places, a lot of places, it‚Äôs collapsing even faster. Michael Saylor (01:33:59): That creates, I don‚Äôt know, $10 trillion a year worth of economic damage. That‚Äôs basically‚Ä¶ Preston Pysh (01:34:07): Wow. Michael Saylor (01:34:07): ‚Ä¶ energy lapse. We‚Äôre all freezing to death. Think about the dysfunction in Lebanon right now. The dysfunction that happens when the bank freezes, the currency collapses. How much creativity in industry is taking place? Or the dysfunction in any war zone and the dysfunction in South America, the dysfunction in Africa. We can almost, you could probably say there‚Äôs been dysfunction in Africa for hundreds of years. You could point that one of the major sources of dysfunction in Africa is the lack of a monetary network with integrity. If I give you a billion dollars in most African nations, how long would the money be there, and would it be gainfully invested or would it be dissipated? It‚Äôs kind of similar to, you‚Äôve got an open artery and I‚Äôm pumping blood into your arm, but it‚Äôs coming out the artery. That‚Äôs the economic problem. Michael Saylor (01:35:16): Then finally, the political problem, the political problem is nobody trusts anybody. If I was sitting with a politician and try to explain why do you need an energy based currency like Bitcoin, why do you need a digital asset without an issuer that‚Äôs properly architected, the proper architecture is the scarcity protocol. Why do you need a functional digital money? The answer is because you don‚Äôt trust the other country and the other country‚Äôs not going to trust you. It‚Äôs like if someone says, ‚ÄúWell, I want it from a company.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, fine. Well, do you want it from a company in China?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, not that company.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, well do you think that 1 billion Chinese‚Ä¶ Michael Saylor (01:36:00): ‚Ä¶ that company. Okay, well, do you think that 1 billion Chinese want it from a company in America? Preston Pysh (01:36:06): Nope. Michael Saylor (01:36:06): No. Do you think the people in North Korea are allowed to get it from you? Do you want it from a company in Cuba? Do you think the Cubans want it from you? Do you think the Russians are going to trust fill-in-the-blank? Are you going to trust them? No country can trust another country. States don‚Äôt trust each other. Cities don‚Äôt trust each other. Companies don‚Äôt trust each other. And if you did, pick the country that you trust. Okay, how about this one? You‚Äôre a Republican. Do you trust America? Yeah. Okay. Are you going to give absolute power to the White House? Not if a Democrat‚Äôs getting elected next month. Okay. Reverse it. You‚Äôre a Democrat. You want to give absolute power to the White House with the possibility that Republican, or your political rival, will be in power? Michael Saylor (01:36:59): So, the truth of the matter is: No country trusts each other, no one can trust any company, and you can‚Äôt trust any institution over time. Okay, so what if I tell you, ‚ÄúWell, I guarantee you the next 10 elections,‚Äù do you still want that much power? What about the 11th? The problem that we‚Äôre solving is monetary integrity through time and space across domain. So, ‚Äúacross space‚Äù means I need to do them everywhere in the world, billions of times an hour. And ‚Äúacross every domain‚Äù means that I need a hundred million companies in a hundred countries to trade with each other across 10,000 different political jurisdictions. Think about how many different agencies and jurisdictions there are. There‚Äôs the county. The precinct. The township. The city. The state. There‚Äôs 47 federal agencies. Now, think about the Cartesian product of 47 federal agencies across a hundred jurisdictions across who-knows-whatever-else. Right? Michael Saylor (01:38:07): It just gets to be such a complicated set of cross products that you can‚Äôt do it. So I need to trade cross domain, cross space, and then I need to trade cross time, and it‚Äôs pretty easy if your definition of time is ‚Äúfor the next eight days.‚Äù You look at most people in this market, they think in terms of hours or days or months, and all their comparisons are that way. ‚ÄúLongterm‚Äù is 10 years. And the last time I saw anybody on television or in the mainstream media do a reasonable analysis where they looked out 10 years, I can‚Äôt remember. That‚Äôs very rare. No one says a hundred years, and nobody says a thousand years. So, if you‚Äôre trying to solve the problem, ‚ÄúHow do you build something truly great?‚Äù you need to look out hundreds of years. The hardest substance, the hardest mineral, is granite or schist. Of all the materials, you want something really hard, the thing that deflects the least under pressure: granite. No surprise that New York City is built on that bedrock, schist, which is that hardest thing. And the question is: How long do I want it to be there? Well, it‚Äôs been there for 200 million years. If I‚Äôm going to build a city: a thousand years. Go look at the Venetians and see the problem of a city that simply holds up for 50 years. They built on pilings. The pilings are sinking an inch a hundred years, or a couple of inches every century. That just doesn‚Äôt work. I mean, it turns out that the city will be gone. Michael Saylor (01:39:51): And so, ultimately, if you want to create something that is going to last a thousand years, that‚Äôs going to work across a hundred million companies, across 10,000 cultures, across 10,000 regulatory domains, and you‚Äôre going to do it at the speed of light, if you‚Äôre going to do it at 50 kilohertz, I want to write a program that looks at a hundred-thousand counterparties every minute, and then moves my assets around to maximize the yield and minimize the risk. And I want 10,000 counterparties of weight come on the network and exit the network. If I want something which is truly fluid and efficient, then it has to be a digital asset. It can‚Äôt be a digital security. And notwithstanding the issue of: You need 250 people to issue a security responsibly. But even if you bought into that notion, the issue is, in the US, we‚Äôre not recognizing Chinese securities. Michael Saylor (01:40:57): The Chinese aren‚Äôt recognizing our securities. And the securities, and the protocols of the securities, are controlled by a management team, and the management team is subject to the influence of a family or a founder. Or, if you‚Äôre the CEO of a company, then there‚Äôs any number of politicians that can hold a gun to your head. The mayor of the town you‚Äôre in can coerce you. The neighborhood association can coerce you. The county can coerce you. The state can coerce you. The federal government can coerce you. 187 regulatory agencies can coerce you. So, to the extent that you have anything where you‚Äôve got an influencer, that they have influence on it, we can make changes if we see fit. That‚Äôs the kiss of death for a commodity, the fact that you can change it. And I think that most of the problems in the world are well-intentioned people changing things. Michael Saylor (01:42:08): That‚Äôs the problem. The fact that you can change it is what corrupts it, right? I mean, literally, what‚Äôs the difference between the definition of ‚Äúchange‚Äù and the definition of ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù? When do you corrupt something and not change it, right? I mean, the truth is: For example, let‚Äôs take another commodity, like steel. Okay? You can change it any way you want. Go ahead. How would you like to change it? I put you in charge. You‚Äôre the CEO of steel. Okay. Now that you‚Äôre the CTO of steel: ‚ÄúPreston, we need you to invalidate steel‚Äôs tensile strength in Russia because we‚Äôre fighting a war. It‚Äôs your patriotic duty.‚Äù Okay. Did you change it? Did you improve it? Did you corrupt it? How about just the difference between: Why is steel a commodity and why is iron a commodity? Well, because when they figured out how to create steel, the recipe was released into the universe and they couldn‚Äôt take it back. Michael Saylor (01:43:21): You can create a commodity. Bronze is an alloy, right? It‚Äôs a creation. And you could argue bronze is a commodity. But it‚Äôs a one-way function. You created it, you released it, and your worst enemy can build a sort of it and kill you with it. That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs a commodity and is not a security. Lord knows if it was a coupon for a bronze sword and I came at you, you would revoke my coupon. Like, ‚ÄúPreston, here‚Äôs a coupon for a Glock. Can you give me the Glock? I‚Äôm going to shoot you in the head with it.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think you were redeeming the coupon, right? And so, fundamentally, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a difference between being able to change something and being able to corrupt something. And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very dangerous to actually take this idealistic notion that we‚Äôre on a journey and to keep building in the protocol. Preston Pysh (01:44:22): So, Michael, I hear this all the time. People will say, ‚ÄúBitcoin just costs too much. Too much energy expense. It‚Äôs too much.‚Äù And my immediate thought when I hear this is, ‚ÄúRelative to what?‚Äù And so, when you think about the existing settlement system, the traditional settlement system, how do you possibly quantify the cost that‚Äôs associated with that? And the cost isn‚Äôt just the numeric energy expense of the existing system. There‚Äôs a lot in there, like you were talking about Africa and how it was unbanked and all these other intangible costs that are associated with a system that is corruptible. Michael Saylor (01:45:05): I think the people that say it costs too much are the 0.1% crypto promoters that are promoting their crypto token. They‚Äôre a yo-yo coin, whatever, and they say a cost too much because they‚Äôre desperately grasping for relevance. Okay? I think that the 98% of the world that doesn‚Äôt really understand or think much about Bitcoin, they don‚Äôt have a strong opinion one way or the other. They hear a little bit of barking from the crypto promoters and the entrepreneurs, but from their point of view, they‚Äôre not sure. Aqueducts costs a lot. Take away the aqueduct and everybody in the city dies. Sewers and reservoirs and dams. The Hoover Dam costs a lot. Power plants cost a lot. Railroads cost a lot. Railroads used to bankrupt everybody. Right? Steel costs a lot. I mean, how many people have ever seen a steel refinery? Gun powder‚Äôs hard to make too. It costs a lot. You study the history of the DuPonts, right? A couple of them got blown up in their own gunpowder factories. Michael Saylor (01:46:19): Dangerous? Yeah. Too dangerous? Not if you want to win the war. Right? I mean, take away the steel, the oil, and the gun powder, and then fight World War I and World War II again. Or take it out of the North. It determines whether you win or whether you lose. Ships cost a lot. The Manhattan Project costs a lot. If you study what went into that, it must have been half a million people were working on all those projects to basically drop two weapons. So, I think you could say, in general, every significant thing cost a lot. Look at the Brooklyn Bridge. Look at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. Look at the skyscraper in Manhattan. Look at Manhattan in general. Costs a lot. They all cost a lot. The Union Pacific Railroad costs a lot to connect the country. Michael Saylor (01:47:10): And they all have the same thing in common. There‚Äôs a profound investment of capital and in human intellect and labor in order to construct something with some degree of utility. And in this particular case, when you look at it in that context, Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt really cost that much at all. Bitcoin is‚Ä¶ Probably there‚Äôs 25, $30 billion of hardware that‚Äôs been purchased or capitalized in the network. They burn something like 3, 4, $5 billion a year worth of electricity to run it. They‚Äôve kind of crossed over to the point where the network is getting‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs probably getting increasingly energy efficient. And so, say it‚Äôs $10 billion a year to run the Bitcoin mining network, which is in essence the Bitcoin security network, for that cost you‚Äôre currently supporting $400 billion of assets. But it‚Äôs like you spent $10 billion on a railroad that‚Äôs worth $400 billion that moves‚Ä¶ What is the number? It‚Äôs billions of dollars an hour of transactions, but it moves trillions and trillions. 10 trillion, $20 trillion a year or more, some large amount, right now. Michael Saylor (01:48:34): But the network is almost infinitely scalable at this point. So the same $10 billion of hardware and energy expenditure per year that could support 10(x) as many transactions or transaction value could support 10(x) the asset value. So it‚Äôs like a railroad. The cost to create the railroad was high. The value of the railroad will scale dramatically by 10(x) and by a 100(x) and by a 1,000(x). Ultimately, it‚Äôs the price you pay for the civilization. You‚Äôre an aviator. The cost of building a 747: obscene. The cost of a First Intercontinental jet is 10, $20 billion for the first plane. The next plane, much cheaper. And you‚Äôre [inaudible 01:49:30], so by the time you‚Äôve been flying the plane for 30 years, you‚Äôve reduced the cost of going between New York and Tokyo down to some few hundred dollars. So, who would actually say it‚Äôs too expensive? The guy that‚Äôs selling the ox cart would say the railroad is too expensive. Preston Pysh (01:49:51): Yes. Yes. Michael Saylor (01:49:52): And the guy that‚Äôs actually got the sailing yacht would say the steamship is too expensive. And the person that was pitching the automobile would say the subway is too expensive. And the dude that wants you to buy coal would say the oil is too expensive. And the oil person would say the nuclear power is too expensive. And if I came up with a fusion reactor that ran off of a bottle of water that would light up the entire city for a hundred years, the dudes in the nuclear industry say, ‚ÄúThis is strange and too expensive.‚Äù Preston Pysh (01:50:29): Toxic. Michael Saylor (01:50:30): ‚Äù Dangerous,‚Äù or something, right? I mean, everybody always says that to prevent the next technology change. So I think that the solution, clearly, is educate those that are objective and explain to them why the civilization is based upon this monetary network. And the monetary network needs to be without an issuer, without dependence on a country or a company. It‚Äôs ironic that it‚Äôs companies that are paying money to lobbyists and academics and non-profits to lobby against Bitcoin‚Äôs energy use because they want you to rely upon their company and their company‚Äôs token. Michael Saylor (01:51:18): And ultimately, it‚Äôs pretty obvious to anyone that thinks about it, that we‚Äôre not going to trust a private company to issue our money. And even if we did, even if it was the most perfect human being imaginable, they‚Äôd better be God and they better live for the next million years, because we‚Äôre not going to trust their kid or their kid‚Äôs kid. Name one person who‚Äôs universally trusted by all 8 billion people on the planet in every nation state. Who would that be? Yeah. The answer is nobody. Nobody can agree on trusting any political or commercial entity, but the one thing we can all agree on is on electricity and fire and steel. In every one of those nations, in every one of those places, if you went and you said, ‚ÄúWho do you trust?‚Äù they couldn‚Äôt agree, but they‚Äôd probably all be using electricity. Michael Saylor (01:52:16): They trust Maxwell‚Äôs equations, by the way. They trust Newtonian physics. And steel is wildly popular, even in communist regimes. Socialist regimes, communist regimes, fascists, leftists, rightists, everybody agrees they like steel. And if you go study civil engineering and you look at how difficult it is to build a building using masonry, stone blocks or a wood, then someone comes along with steel‚Ä¶ And steel is kind of like the solution to everybody‚Äôs problem for the next 2000 years. And it‚Äôs such a good solution that all your problems go away, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what your politics are. So I think that the most important point to make about Bitcoin is Bitcoin is crypto steel. It‚Äôs digital steel, and it has to be a commodity without an issuer. Michael Saylor (01:53:11): And if you‚Äôre not going to be reliant on the efforts of others‚Ä¶ Gensler uses this phrase a lot: ‚ÄúEfforts of others.‚Äù It‚Äôs the Howey Test. Definition of investment contract is: some people make an investment of money based upon the efforts of others. But forget about the idea of whether it‚Äôs an investment contract or, ‚ÄúDid you invest money?‚Äù The point really is: When you walk out on a steel bridge, you don‚Äôt want to be reliant upon the efforts of others halfway around the world to make the bridge not collapse. So forgetting about‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt have to be caught up in the debate over security versus commodity. The real question is: Can you create digital material and digital energy? Can you create digital matter? If I want to create a bridge, I need to create it with a material that will not collapse depending upon the opinion of a politician or the opinion of a company, and I don‚Äôt want to have to worry about a software engineer putting a bug in the code. Michael Saylor (01:54:14): That‚Äôs why I trust what? I trust a steel that‚Äôs that‚Äôs been certified after I‚Äôve seen it successful for 50 years or 100 years. And that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt trust balsa wood. And that‚Äôs why I wouldn‚Äôt trust a software-actuated bridge. When we break this rule, tragedy occurs. If you look at the Boeing 737 MAX debacle‚Ä¶ The 737 is a totally safe plane, and it‚Äôs probably one of the safest planes ever built. They engineered it in the 1970s. The sixties and the seventies, right? It‚Äôs been flying that long. Why did it start falling out of the skies 50 years later? It‚Äôs because some well meaning engineer wanted to improve it. ‚ÄúWe can make it better.‚Äù And so, the way they made it better is they wrote software that attempted to compensate for human error, because the software engineers arrogantly thought that they were better than the pilots. Playing God is‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a pretty serious responsibility. Preston Pysh (01:55:31): Especially when you don‚Äôt have a hundred people on the plane, but you have the whole planet on the plane. Michael Saylor (01:55:36): Good point. Yeah. I mean, what happened with 737 is they overengineered the software and the software crashed the plane and killed everybody. And if they hadn‚Äôt done anything, the pilots would‚Äôve done just fine. And I think that that‚Äôs the argument in favor of simplicity, right? Preston Pysh (01:55:58): Yes. Michael Saylor (01:55:58): ‚ÄúKeep it simple, stupid.‚Äù Preston Pysh (01:56:00): Yes, yes. Michael Saylor (01:56:02): And mission critical systems‚Ä¶ You see this a lot in the military. When someone‚Äôs life depends on something, oftentimes you would opt for the low-tech solution where you can verify it with your own eyes. I don‚Äôt want a piece of software that runs a million lines of code that tells me that the thing is stable. I want to test it myself, or I want to see it, that it‚Äôs stable. And I think to your point, the difference is: When software drives a car, the software may kill you. And when software flies an airplane, the software may kill 100 people or 500 people or 1,000. Michael Saylor (01:56:46): But when software runs the monetary network, may kill a billion. Actually, the truth is we‚Äôve got two problems. Two extremes. And maybe they‚Äôre both the same. One extreme is central bankers running the monetary system, and every time they change something, they make it worse. And we just saw that happen in Britain this week. Just chaos. A trillion dollars changes hands, and the bankers say, ‚ÄúOh, well, we were busy trying to keep a bunch of pension funds and institutions from a massive loss of billions of dollars.‚Äù What they don‚Äôt say is, ‚Äù We were busy keeping a bunch of rational investors on the other side of the trade from making billions of dollars.‚Äù Preston Pysh (01:57:35): Yes. Amen. Michael Saylor (01:57:37): I mean, they took a hundred-billion from one group and gave it to another group that happened to be politically connected, and then they masquerade as virtuously protecting the system from a meltdown. What they were doing was they were keeping the system from rationally correcting to a fair interest rate and rewarding rational thinkers that did the right thing. And they punished- Preston Pysh (01:58:02): And incentivizing, in the future, for more people to pile in to further risk. Yeah. Michael Saylor (01:58:10): Yeah, they create that moral hazard. Preston Pysh (01:58:12): Yes. Michael Saylor (01:58:12): Right? Preston Pysh (01:58:13): Yes. Thank you. Michael Saylor (01:58:13): Punish the wise, reward the foolish, and create an insane world where the only way to get ahead is to act foolish. And if anybody ever fixes the world, everybody dies, so they turn the world upside down. And they did that manually. The danger with software-driven systems is you might inadvertently‚Ä¶ Some piece of code in the system meant to optimize for something and it just goes catastrophically awry, and it crashes the entire system for everybody else. It‚Äôs a classic example of the phrase, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the perfect be the enemy of the good.‚Äù Michael Saylor (01:58:56): The whole problem with most of these networks is they‚Äôre continually chasing perfection, and they‚Äôre willing to accept all sorts of ineffable, non-quantifiable risks that they don‚Äôt understand in order to pursue a tangible benefit they can see. So the fact that we manage to avoid a $50 billion loss by a pension fund is used as a justification to inflict a trillion dollars of damage on everybody else who is not on the fund. But I‚Äôm not wise enough to necessarily conceptualize the trillion dollars of damage I‚Äôm doing. Or maybe I am, but it‚Äôs just they‚Äôre not screaming at me right now, so I‚Äôm going to take the expedient path. Preston Pysh (01:59:44): Michael, when we talk about energy, everything that we‚Äôve kind of talked to date, or in this discussion, has been a defensive response to what we hear all the time. What also drives me a little crazy is: I get all these DMs from people showing me various charts of how they‚Äôre using Bitcoin almost like a capacitor or a battery on the grid to strengthen the grid to make it more reliable. And the excess energy above whatever‚Äôs being required off the grid is being immediately converted into stored energy, digital energy, and it‚Äôs just making the grid more robust. You look at the flaring, the methane, and you look at how Bitcoin can be used in that capacity, and it‚Äôs earth-shattering what this adds to the infrastructure for energy companies. I guess go on the offense of and explain to people that are listening how revolutionary this is for energy companies. Michael Saylor (02:00:46): Yeah, I guess to that point: If all you do is write software, then the only thing you can ever do is improve virtual circumstances. So anything that‚Äôs software only means you‚Äôre creating a virtual machine to move imaginary tokens around to achieve an imaginary goal to create imaginary happiness. And you‚Äôll never get out of that metaverse. You‚Äôre kind of trapped in the metaverse. If we were wired in cubicles, getting fed through a feeding tube or an IV and we never moved and we lived in our brains, then maybe you would just focus on that metaverse. But that is literally like the Matrix. If on the other hand, you want to improve things in the universe, if you have interest in solving problems in the universe like clean water or healthy food or a comfortable environment or providing people with physical luxury, then you have to build machines and you have to manipulate matter and energy. Michael Saylor (02:01:49): So, the number one problem with all the non-energy-based cryptos is they‚Äôre all just software programs, and so you can write a hundred million billion software programs, they‚Äôre never going to feed you. The only way that you‚Äôre going to change the real universe is plug a piece of software into a machine. And so, Bitcoin Mining is really the digital energy business, and what you‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôve got a software protocol plugged into a machine and the machine is converting electricity, intermittent electricity anywhere in the earth powered by any energy source, into digital energy; and it‚Äôs also creating security and integrity. So what you‚Äôre getting is you‚Äôre getting a block of digital energy, an asset that you can move around at the speed of light, friction-free, but you are also getting a block of digital energy, digital scarcity, digital money that will last forever. And so, the entire network is therefore monetizing energy, and that means you‚Äôve created a machine to convert waste energy into digital energy. That‚Äôs really valuable for remediating methane or remediating stranded natural gas. Michael Saylor (02:03:20): It‚Äôs also useful for monetizing stranded geothermal or stranded any other power. You‚Äôre never going to monetize stranded power or waste power with a software-only program, right? So all the proof-of-stake networks are irrelevant to solving an energy problem because they‚Äôre not interfacing with energy. So the real value of Bitcoin to the energy business is: I can monetize intermittent energy. I can monetize stranded energy. I can recycle wasted energy. I can create an economic sponsor to either develop an energy source where it would not be economically viable. Right? So I‚Äôve got a small, stranded group of people that need energy, and I can‚Äôt afford to build a plant to scale for them unless I pair a Bitcoin miner with their colony. So I can deliver energy to a place that needs it. And one example would be a small group of people that need it or a small business that needs it. Another example would be: I need to run a generator on a methane flare, and it costs money to bring in the generator, right? Preston Pysh (02:04:41): Mm-hmm. Michael Saylor (02:04:42): So it costs money to remediate the methane flaring, and I can‚Äôt afford to do that if there‚Äôs no customer for the electricity that I generate or the pure energy I create. So Bitcoin allows you to pursue all sorts of these energy monetization strategies at different frequencies, at different scale, intermittently and off of different sources. It also allows you to cross political jurisdiction. So if you look at why Bitcoin mining is interesting, it would be interesting to any nation that wanted a hard currency export. So I might do Bitcoin mining just to generate hard currency when I have no other natural buyer for my exports. Preston Pysh (02:05:34): Yeah. Michael Saylor (02:05:35): I might do Bitcoin mining to monetize stranded or waste energy because I know a customer. I might do Bitcoin mining because I have an interest in security itself and I might have capital that I just want to put into this. So if I have extra capital. I might do it because I have extra semiconductor capacity, too. So there are a lot of motives for this, but in terms of environmental conservation, it seems, to me, to be the only technology that can monetize stranded or waste energy or remediate environmental fluttering of any scale anywhere. I mean, most of the other ideas are kind of crippled ideas. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to scale them up to be meaningful. Preston Pysh (02:06:40): Michael, I have a friend that has sent me an article kind of getting into some of the things that we‚Äôve been talking about throughout this interview. I‚Äôll have a link to that in the show notes. He goes by ‚ÄúBaseload.btc.‚Äù And he made the comment to me, he said, ‚ÄúBitcoin is basically the best ESG investment vehicle in tech ever invented.‚Äù And so, I think for people on the outside, they might hear that statement, they might laugh hysterically, and say, ‚ÄúHow in the world could that possibly be true? It uses energy.‚Äù But when you look at the incentive structure of what Bitcoin incentivizes, especially on the long tail, 10, 15, 20 years from now, how do you envision Bitcoin miners being integrated into the grid? And do you agree with his statement that it‚Äôs the best ‚ÄúESG investment vehicle and tech ever invented‚Äù? Michael Saylor (02:07:35): I do agree with the statement. I think that it‚Äôs pretty clear that, environmentally, it‚Äôs the most efficient use of electricity to create value that the human race has come up with. And so, on the energy side or the environmental side, it seems to be pretty obviously clean and useful. If you look at the other two, the S and the G, from a societal point of view, you‚Äôre giving economic empowerment to 8 billion people. Digital money- Michael Saylor (02:08:00): ‚Ä¶ giving economic empowerment to 8 billion people, digital money to the human race. So it‚Äôs obviously good for the society, you‚Äôre banking everybody. And then from a governance point of view, it‚Äôs a digital asset or a digital network without an issuer. So corporate governance or governance normally is all about fair governance. And this phrase popped up because there were companies that were thought to be poorly governed maybe for the benefit of the family or the benefit of the community to the detriment of the shareholders, et cetera, Bitcoin is literally without a CEO, without a board of directors, it is the most fairly governed thing in the universe. It‚Äôs more fair than any country, any city, any state, any company. So in terms of ESG, it definitely checks all three boxes. In fact, it hits home, runs out of the park on all three. I‚Äôd probably just make one more point here, which is look, if you‚Äôre concerned about ESG, you really asked the question, what is a universal entitlement to the human race? The most ESG friendly stuff is clean water, power, bandwidth like internet access, steel, functioning materials, transportation, and just pure energy, food. These are the things that life is based on. So if you want to create a civilization, and the Romans knew this, a famous historian and he said, ‚ÄúI admire the Romans for their aqueducts, their roads and their drains.‚Äù And you think about this, ‚ÄúOh really drains?‚Äù Well, the aqueducts brought water to the city, and the normal consequence of course is the city population grows by a factor of 10. And without the water, you can‚Äôt flush away the waste byproduct because everybody dies of typhus or some cholera, some awful disease. So you need the water and then you need the roads to be able to move. Michael Saylor (02:10:14): And then the drains carried away the waste and they carried away the waste water and also shed water so that the buildings didn‚Äôt collapse and kill everybody. So if you think about that and aqueducts is ESG friendly, it‚Äôs very expensive to build the first one and lawyer to help you. And it‚Äôs hard to build the first one. I mean no one else could figure it out. That‚Äôs why the Romans dominated because no one‚Äôs could figure it out. And then after the Romans disappeared, people forgot how to do it and the civilization collapsed. And 90% of the people died in some of these cities because you run out of water three days and you‚Äôre dead. Michael Saylor (02:10:56): So I think if you think about Bitcoin, the same framework, a digital energy network, it is providing the ultimate gift, which is clean money. Clean money to go along with your clean air, clean power, clean food, clean water. And what happens if the water is dirty? We die. If the air is dirty, we die. If the food is dirty, we die. If the money is dirty, it kills us. The money is dirty right now. And you want to see what happens in an environment where the money is dirty just go to any economy where the currency‚Äôs collapsing. Like all those people in Lebanon that are robbing banks to try to get their own money back. They don‚Äôt count the number of people that commit suicide probably after they get wiped out from that but it‚Äôs quite a lot. Michael Saylor (02:11:54): So I think anybody that really cares about ESG care about a fair, equitable, monetary network and establishing a stable financial foundation or monetary foundation for the human race to stand on. There could be nothing more important at this stage I think. Short of just don‚Äôt nuke us, all right? As long as we don‚Äôt explode in a nuclear fire, then I think after that we need to fix the money. Preston Pysh (02:12:23): On that point, when we look around the world and we look at what I alluded to earlier as far as this strife that‚Äôs happening between net producers and net consumers around the world because they can‚Äôt agree on how they‚Äôre going to be paid for tangible items that are desirable. We started off this conversation with Jeff Booth‚Äôs quote, and I want to end it here on a similar note, but I‚Äôm going to invert his quote and if I invert his quote I say, it reads, ‚ÄúIf the money is sound desirable resources will be efficiently consumed and managed and global cooperation should take place.‚Äù Do you agree with that? And paint a picture for us, what does the world look like? Are we able to divert this enormous amount of social unrest that is brewing? And the trend of that is looking very concerning for a lot of people. I hear from people all the time, they‚Äôre very scared as to what‚Äôs happening in the world right now. Paint of picture for us in a Bitcoin world. Michael Saylor (02:13:29): Unsound money creates chaos and foolishness. The definition of foolish is shortsighted and chaos is uncoordinated. So foolishness and chaos is what you get when you have unsung like this collapsing. And when you have a shared sound monetary network, which is what Bitcoin represents, you get the opposite. You get rational order. We‚Äôre orderly, you‚Äôre going to get trade through time and space. I can now afford to invest. I can build something for the next three years to sell you for a lot of money in the fourth year. And I can find a way to finance it. And I don‚Äôt expect the society to collapse in four years. So I can make long-term investments, I can do long-term research, I can defer gratification and then I can transfer my capital for me to you for the next year because it‚Äôs fair and I‚Äôll get a fair return on it. Michael Saylor (02:14:36): So you get rational behavior by producers and by savers you get trading. If I could trade cross borders, that‚Äôs a big deal. Being able to trade with everybody. I mean every country is not trading with everybody. We have massive efficiencies cause we can‚Äôt trade with China right now. If you want to fix it, you bring down the trade barriers and then you can trade. And the ideal network would allow you to trade within anybody over any domain, at any frequency for any period. And that‚Äôs a big idea, like any frequency. How do I trade a thousand times an hour between 100 countries? Now that‚Äôs impossible. How do I trade with someone in another country where the duration of the contract is six years or 60 years? Michael Saylor (02:15:40): For example, there‚Äôs a joke you‚Äôre going to give someone loan for 100 years when the payment is in a fiat currency that‚Äôs collapsing. That makes no sense at all. So it‚Äôs impossible to do that. But what if the trade wasn‚Äôt in the currency that was collapsing? What if it was in Bitcoin something that‚Äôs scarce? So in a sound environment with sound money and technically proficient monitoring network, then I think you get high frequency, high bandwidth trading over long durations with a bias toward rational action. Michael Saylor (02:16:24): I‚Äôm not saying everybody would act rationally because some people are so stupid and do stupid things and we can‚Äôt always agree on what the rational behavior is. But the bias is toward rational action because over time the rational actors will accumulate the capital and the irrational actors get squeezed out of system. And in unsound money environment, the irrational actors accumulate the capital. The rational actors sometimes are being squeezed out of the system and everybody learns that if they don‚Äôt actually influence a politician to give them some unfair advantage, they can‚Äôt get ahead. Michael Saylor (02:17:02): So instead of investing all my time in figuring out how to build goods and services and products that people need, I invest all my time trying to figure out how to manipulate the political system to get an unfair advantage to steal from someone else. In essence, you have the rise of the parasite class. Politicians and lawyers and lobbyists that are manipulating the public in order to give themself an advantage. And it gets so bad that even if you are a creator, you still have to hire lobbyists and lawyers to protect you from the other parasites. So large portions of the economy are diverted to parasitic activity. And when you have a sound monetary system and a sound monetary asset, then the tendency is toward the opposite. Michael Saylor (02:17:54): I‚Äôve said before, I think Bitcoin fixes half the problems in the world. So I should interpose right now only half. Half the problems are due to defective money and a crippled monetary network. The other half of the problems are due to politics and culture and acts of nature and force majeure, things that are beyond our control. So I have no doubt they‚Äôll still be unfair rules and unfair cultures and unfair situations and suboptimal things. Even if we fix the money, that‚Äôs why the other half will be there. But I do think that we inflict about twice as much inefficiency on ourself as we need to by having defective money. And if you‚Äôre looking for a metaphor, the simple metaphor is one athlete had to give a pint of blood before they ran the race and the other athlete didn‚Äôt. Preston Pysh (02:18:59): That‚Äôs no world I want to live in if I‚Äôm the one not receiving. Michael Saylor (02:19:04): Yeah. It‚Äôs just a never ending drain. On the energy of the civilization it‚Äôs like how well you going to run? Or are you going to train for the Olympics in four years if I tell you that I‚Äôm seizing your house in one year and you‚Äôre going to jail in two years. It‚Äôs just very difficult to focus. So what you have is you have a lot of chaos that‚Äôs interfering. What you would do is you would stop and you would hire a lawyer to defend you on the one thing and then you would go shopping for another place to live that you‚Äôre not going to lose for the other thing. And in the third block of time, if you had time left, you would train for the marathon. Preston Pysh (02:19:47): So Michael, is there anything else that you think we may be left out or that you think is important to this conversation? Michael Saylor (02:19:55): Yeah. I mean the entire talk about energy, it just brings me back to a basic principle. The whole problem and the civilization is an energy and balance and an energy and efficiency at the base of our entire economy and maybe the base of our entire civilization. And we‚Äôre trying to fix it. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs a whole in the civilization and trillions of dollars of energy are flowing out of that container every year, and we need to plug the hole. Michael Saylor (02:20:38): I think of it like this. If you think about the basis of the money supply, it‚Äôs the US dollars of the reserve currency of the world, all the other currencies are linked to it. You‚Äôve got 100 trillion worth of that stuff floating around. And then you‚Äôve got other currency derivatives. You‚Äôve got bonds, massive amounts of bonds, massive amounts of real estate, property and stocks. And you‚Äôve got companies that are valued based on cash flows. Michael Saylor (02:21:12): So let‚Äôs say we have 500 trillion worth of stuff in the civilization. All is really predicated upon this fundamental unit of account, store of value, medium and exchange, which is the fiat currency, that underlying currency that‚Äôs collapsing right now. And we talked about a collapsing 10 to 20% a year and all of those derivatives of the currency are losing value. So you could almost think about the civilization resting on a platform, which you got a big hole in it, and the energy of the civilization is draining out that hole. Bitcoin represents a new monetary base. What we have is that digital scarcity. And the idea is 100 years ago we thought goals should be the basis and then it became fiat should be the basis. And now we create digital scarcity as the basis or what we might say is a perfect ledger. Michael Saylor (02:22:18): And if we had a fair, equitable immutable ledger or a proper ledger, a ledger that didn‚Äôt lose 10% or more of its energy a year, but rather it was conservative. In that case, the goal becomes to shift the entire civilization from an imperfect foundation that‚Äôs losing. It doesn‚Äôt really matter whether it‚Äôs 10% or 20% or 7%, all of those numbers. And even 2% is too much. If the civilization is sitting on a foundation where two or three or five or 20% of the energy is lapsing out the bottom of it every year into the ether. Then you‚Äôve got a suboptimal situation. And when the number gets to be 20 or 30%, you approach economic collapse. Michael Saylor (02:23:17): So that‚Äôs the problem. The solution is seal the energy lapse. We have to seal the economic system. We‚Äôve invented a way to do it. This crypto steel or digital energy, which we know is Bitcoin, we‚Äôve invented a way to do it. You can‚Äôt do it with a country. We‚Äôve been trying to do it with the political process. The British tried to do it the pound, we tried to do it with the dollar, the Mark, the Peso, the Franc, the Euro. So we already know what happens when we try to do it politically. We can‚Äôt do it corporately because nobody trusts a company. We can‚Äôt use Apple stock as the basis of the civilization. I mean a company is even less credible than a country. So we‚Äôre left looking for a digital asset which is trustworthy with integrity, an economic material that is strong enough to build a civilization on top of without it collapsing. Michael Saylor (02:24:34): I gave you the model of Venice as the city collapsing and pilings that keep sinking. And our civilization is a bigger problem than Venice. We‚Äôre collapsing at a faster rate on pilings that are sinking. The challenge of humanity forever has been how do I build something that will last on a foundation that won‚Äôt sag over 100 years? How do I build a civilization over 1,000 years? So we‚Äôve got this idea, digital asset that we call Bitcoin. And now the challenge is how do we move 500 trillion of weight? Because you can measure mass and energy and monetary terms. A million dollars will buy you a certain amount of steel. A billion dollars will buy you thousand x more steel. So you can measure the mass of the civilization and money. Michael Saylor (02:25:37): We need to shift our entire civilization to a firmer foundation. We need to move from a swamp to granite. And the only way we‚Äôre going to do it is if everybody can agree on something that‚Äôs fair and equitable. And that means it needs to be open and it needs to be permissionless and it needs to be incorruptible, indestructible, immortal. And once you understand the idea that we need to move from something which is not working. If you‚Äôre an American, you might think the dollar works but we can be quite sure if we go to the Russians, they‚Äôre not going to say the dollar works. It‚Äôs not working for them. And if you go to the Chinese, they would disagree. And of course everybody would disagree that everybody else is foundation works. Michael Saylor (02:26:30): So if we want to create a civilization that rests on a mathematically sound foundation, you need to create an economic material that will not deflect. And that‚Äôs really the story of civilization. The iron age was an improvement over bronze and steel was an improvement over iron, and the truss is an improvement over the beam. And each crude oil and oil is an improvement over pedal power or a wind power. So the civilization is a continual quest for a stronger material upon which to build a civilization. Michael Saylor (02:27:15): And when your life depends on it, things become apolitical. Like if you had a Republican and a Democrat and a communist and a socialist, and they‚Äôre all standing on the 88 floor of a building that‚Äôs got steel beams and you recommended that you replace that with organic bamboo leaves to be ESG friendly all the way down. You probably wouldn‚Äôt get much consensus. You could probably get them to agree that the steel beams in the concrete floors seems a little bit better than organic bamboo leaves as a structural material upon which, and even if I was radical, I probably wouldn‚Äôt march my three year old son or daughter across the 88 floor organic bamboo leaves. Michael Saylor (02:28:10): So generally people can get beyond competition in politics when it is truly a utilitarian entitlement. Even competitors that hate each other both use electricity, they still use math, they‚Äôll still use the English language, they‚Äôll still use concrete and steel and they‚Äôll still fly in airplanes because it‚Äôs pretty axiomatic to everybody that these things work. So the most fundamental thing to understand about Bitcoin is if we‚Äôre going to improve the economy, if we‚Äôre going to create an ethical monetary asset and a trustworthy technically sound, economically sound, ethically sound, monetary network, you‚Äôre going to have to do it in a fashion that it doesn‚Äôt require nor does it allow the intervention of a company, an individual, a group of programmers, a country, a politician. And to the extent that anybody doubts that it is neutral, it will fail. It needs to be beyond a shadow of a doubt. Nobody in China thinks that an American politician can make their steel building collapse by passing a law in America. That‚Äôs why they use steel. And that‚Äôs why we universally use steel to build beautiful things. Michael Saylor (02:29:41): So fundamentally, if this conversation is made me think anything, what it makes me think is, it‚Äôs just very important that people see the stakes. 500 trillion with 10 to 20 trillion going down the drain every year versus 500 trillion. What happens to the 500 trillion when we close the drain? You get 20 trillion worth of prosperity per year and you compound that over a few years and the human race there steps up to prosperity. And I think we can all agree on an engineering breakthrough. Michael Saylor (02:30:27): So when you‚Äôre talking to politicians or Investor‚Äôs and they say, ‚ÄúWhy energy?‚Äù It‚Äôs because we‚Äôre trying to engineer a better world. And you can‚Äôt engineer a better physical world without physical energy and physical matter. If you want to engineer a virtual world, put on your virtual goggles, put on music and stare at some avatar and never take them off, and then software might solve that problem. But it‚Äôs certainly not going to solve the problem that the human race has and is going to have for the next 10,000 years. Michael Saylor (02:31:09): We need to live in the real world, in the universe, and we need to do the one thing that human beings have always done in order to elevate their condition. And that one thing is to channel energy. We will either channel energy and prosper as a nation, as a civilization, as a people, or we will fail to channel energy and we will suffer. And of course, if another country or another people figure‚Äôs out how to channel energy better than us will be extinct, our entire way of life collapses. And the world is full of examples. A lot of people that thought that explosives were too difficult to invest in, the Native Americans didn‚Äôt have explosives. They didn‚Äôt have railroads either. I mean the Romans invested in serious siege equipment and roads and standardized production and many of their enemies did not. And we know how that ended. Michael Saylor (02:32:18): Ultimately, it‚Äôs the channeling of energy that determines the winners from the losers. And our best hope to uplift all of the civilization, all of humanity, is to channel energy more effectively. And money is the last great engineering feat for us to move to the next stage. You can point toward already extraordinary achievements in channeling information, energy and electrical energy and mechanical energy and chemical energy and nuclear energy. But if you‚Äôre looking for the great breakthroughs in channeling economic energy, you had coinage followed by banknotes, followed by credit and here we are. And none of those previous systems were channeling economic energy would be deemed by an engineer to be anywhere near acceptable. Any machine that lost 2, 3, 5, 10% of its energy, every cycle would‚Äôve been discarded as a prototype. Preston Pysh (02:33:25): Wow. And it‚Äôs such an exclamation mark for me when you‚Äôre saying the stakes are so high. People that are listening to this that are not heavily involved in economics or understand what‚Äôs happening in the markets right now, I don‚Äôt think fully understand how profound this 500 trillion number that you‚Äôre stating, I don‚Äôt think they fully understand how precarious that is at this exact moment in time. Michael Saylor (02:33:57): No, it‚Äôs pretty critical. I mean, the Romans invented the aqueducts, the empire rose but then again the aqueducts broke and people forgot how to fix them and the empire fell. And we invented nuclear power and then we created the nuclear regulatory commission. And for 50 years we stopped building nuclear power plants and now we‚Äôre staring at massive crisis throughout the world because we can‚Äôt generate enough energy. And one wonders, if we hadn‚Äôt stopped and investing and building nuclear energy, would we have any energy crisis right now? Michael Saylor (02:34:36): So we can‚Äôt take it for granted. There are examples of the political system destroying engineering achievements, but there are other examples of the political system embracing them. And I think right now it‚Äôs pretty important for all of us to communicate to the politicians, to the mainstream media, to investor‚Äôs that this is superior technology. This is digital energy technology, digital energy, digital money, digital commodities. They‚Äôre critical to embrace and especially digital scarcity to the future of the human race. And I‚Äôm optimistic, but we just have a lot of talking to do. Preston Pysh (02:35:23): You and me, both. When I look at the complexity of it, the education is the piece that we‚Äôve just got to keep on educating people on what this is. Especially when we look at policy makers that are being fed, all sorts of narratives that come with individual incentives attached to them sometimes that are parasitic type narratives. And having a conversation like this with you, Michael, specifically around energy, because I think it‚Äôs one of the biggest pieces that is really difficult for people to wrap their head around, I can‚Äôt thank you enough for making this time that you‚Äôve made to try to explain it from your point of view as to what this thing is. Just really appreciate it. Michael Saylor (02:36:08): Yeah, thanks for having me. I appreciated it. It‚Äôs fun working through these things.

,,Michael Saylor giveaway scam by impersonator strips Bitcoin investors for $1.1 million,"As Bitcoin continues to get more mainstream, the number of Bitcoin scams in the market is increasing simultaneously. Recently, there‚Äôs been a fake Bitcoin address impersonating the famous Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor. As per the recent reports, the scam address has received a staggering $1.1 million worth of Bitcoin in January alone. Such impersonating scams have been a growing threat in the crypto industry. Last year, we have seen several such impersonating scams under the name of famous billionaire Elon Musk. Such scams usually target high-profile people who have been associated with the Bitcoin community. The most common scams are offering users to double their BTC after sending them to a particular wallet. Needless to say, all the BTC that goes to the scammers‚Äô addresses are completely lost. Although these scams sound too good to be true, many people have a victim to them. Last Saturday, January 15, Whale Alert reported one address confirmed to be impersonating Michael Saylor. üöî A payment of 26 #BTC (1,124,191 USD) was just made to a confirmed Michael Saylor Giveaway scam!https://t.co/YNYRBLBt4P ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 15, 2022  Responding to it, Saylor said that he continues to report such addresses. However, they continue to pop up too often in recent times. Responding to this tweet, Saylor added: 489 of these scams were launched on YouTube last week. We report them every 15 minutes and they are taken down after a few hours, but the scammers just launch more‚Ä¶ Over the last year, multiple cryptocurrency scams have been on the rise across several popular digital assets. Last month, hackers hacked the Twitter profile of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promoting a Bitcoin giveaway scam. Related: Indian PM‚Äôs Twitter hacked account promotes Bitcoin scam, claims India buying 500 BTC The tweet from the official account claimed that the government of India was buying 500 BTC. Besides, the scammers have also been keeping the law enforcement and regulatory agencies on their toes. In November 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned users of growing crypto scams using QR codes and ATMs. These scammers usually impersonate government officials or from a lottery that demands some fee before offering the reward. These criminals then direct the victim to visit a physical cryptocurrency ATM for buying the coins. Post the purchase, the scammers ask the victims to use a QR code thereby withdrawing all funds to the scammers‚Äô wallets. Popular meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) which created a storm in Q4 2021 was also at the center of one such crypto scam. Several Shiba Inu scams were floating on multiple social media platforms. Such platforms, especially YouTube, have become hotbeds for scammers to attract people.

,,"Bitcoin ETFs Register The Biggest Single-Day Trading Volume, Whales Accumulate","      TRENDING TODAY Bitcoin ETFs continue to be the driving force behind all the trading activity that‚Äôs taking place in and around BTC. On Tuesday, February 20, Bloomberg Intelligence‚Äôs senior ETF strategist Eric Balchunas stated that the nine Bitcoin ETFs have registered the biggest single-day trading volume ever since the launch. In his post on the X platform, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas said that the combined trading volume reached approximately $2 billion, fueled by notable contributions from $HODL, $BTCW, and $BITB, all of which shattered their previous volume records. Balchunas underscores the magnitude of this achievement by providing context: the $2 billion trading volume places The Nine ETFs in the realm of the top 10 among ETFs and the top 20 among individual stocks in terms of trading activity. VanEck‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF has seen an impressive surge, with its trading volume surpassing $300 million, a significant leap compared to its previous best trading day. Data from Yahoo Finance indicates that the ETF achieved its highest daily trading volume of $25.5 million on its launch day, January 11th. On the other hand, Bitcoin maverick and MicroStrategy chief Michael Saylor emphasized his commitment to holding onto MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin in the near future. He pointed out the substantial influx of capital from traditional systems into digital platforms through Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting Bitcoin‚Äôs increasing value compared to assets like gold, real estate, and the S&P Index. Apart from Michael Saylor, other market analysts also believe that Wall Street is trying to corner the Bitcoin market. Blackrock is starting to take creation orders before the 5pm deadline. BTC demand is rock solid. This is not a drill. Wall Street is literally trying to corner the Bitcoin market. If you are short Bitcoin or not holding enough, your window of opportunity is closing. Don't F it up ‚Äî Mike Alfred (@mikealfred) February 20, 2024  CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, reported that earlier this week on Monday, February 19, the Bitcoin whale accumulation addresses received a net inflow of 25,300 BTC in just one day, marking a record-breaking surge. Accumulation addresses are typically those with specific criteria, including no outgoing transactions, a balance exceeding 10 BTC, exclusion of certain address types, and recent activity within the past 7 years. Amid all these developments surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, the Bitcoin price remains steady at around $52,000 keeping investors waiting for the next move. Any directional move outside the range of $51,700 and $52,515 would give a clear indication of where is the BTC price heading.

,,Michael Saylor's Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Bet Has Rebounded,"17 MINS AGORTTNEWS 18 MINS AGOTHE MOTLEY FOOL 18 MINS AGOGOBANKINGRATES Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy‚Äôs founder and executive chairman, has seen his bold bet on bitcoin vindicated as BTC‚Äôs price has risen dramatically since his resignation as CEO. A longtime Bitcoin advocate, Saylor began publicly purchasing large amounts of bitcoin in 2020, devoting MicroStrategy‚Äôs resources to several high-profile acquisitions that built up a reserve of nearly $2 billion worth by 2022. Although he began these purchases with the bitcoin price at around $10,000, the price had reached more than $30,000 by August 2022, roughly where the price sits at the time of this writing. Many of the firm‚Äôs largest purchases were at the higher end of this premium, and Saylor resigned from his position as CEO that same month as MicroStrategy reported a $1 billion loss related to a bitcoin price slump. After Saylor‚Äôs resignation, poor performance from bitcoin turned worse as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX cratered in spectacular fashion in November 2022. Through the rest of the year, the bitcoin price remained at around half of what it was when Saylor and MicroStrategy made many of its purchases. However, rising from these lows, the cryptocurrency rose dramatically and consistently throughout 2023 until seeming to generally recover from this valley. One year on from his departure from leading MicroStrategy, it seems that Saylor‚Äôs persistence is bearing fruit. Although he resigned from his position as CEO, responsible for day-to-day management and operations of his company, he did retain a role as executive chairman of its board, leading the company‚Äôs shareholders and representing the firm publicly. With a focus on continuing the firm‚Äôs bitcoin strategy, Saylor continued buying thousands of bitcoin at reduced prices, and his commitment seems to be paying off. In a recent tweet, Saylor noted MicroStrategy‚Äôs 254% increase in stock price since the beginning of his strategy, comparing it to the stock prices of firms like Google and Apple, which rose 78% and 74%, respectively. The decision to publicly tie MicroStrategy‚Äôs fortune to bitcoin has, at least for now, led to gains unrelated to the firm‚Äôs core products and offerings. This month, the company revealed a plan to sell $750 million of its stock, ostensibly to make further large purchases of bitcoin, and its value rose when the news broke. Saylor‚Äôs work with Bitcoin has gone beyond this high-profile advocacy, as he has taken to development work on the Lightning Network in the past year as well. More than anything, these displays of conviction have shown that his commitment to Bitcoin‚Äôs economic vision are genuine, rather than based merely on the dollar price at any given time. This decision to wholeheartedly back Bitcoin has seemingly turned into a durable business strategy, capable of weathering and surmounting significant tempests in the global economy.

,,The Accused Fraudster Behind the Bitcoin Boom,"Times are bad, which means, by the perverse logic of American capitalism, stock markets and speculative investments are flourishing. Bitcoin, the digital currency whose value is pegged to nothing but the amount its adherents are willing to pay for it, is at an all-time high, approaching $29,000 at the end of 2020. For those who held on and defended Bitcoin during its fallow periods, its time seems to have finally come, particularly as PayPal promises to allow customers to start buying and selling cryptocurrencies next year. Every bull market has its whales, and for Bitcoin of late the biggest whale has been Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, a Virginia-based enterprise software company. Saylor, who controls a majority of his company‚Äôs voting shares, has put more than $1.2 billion of MicroStrategy funds into Bitcoin, much of it in just the last month. The company now calls Bitcoin its ‚Äúprimary treasury reserve asset.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs bold positioning (raising debt offerings explicitly to buy Bitcoin) and unapologetic attitude (he‚Äôs become a regular on the cryptocurrency talk circuit) have made him a darling of crypto-loving Redditors and tech executives inspired by his example. (A Canadian augmented reality company recently announced, as part of its capital diversification strategy, that it was putting $2 million into Bitcoin, which the CEO called a ‚Äúdigital version of gold.‚Äù) The strategy has been more than good for Saylor, who claims to personally own nearly 18,000 Bitcoin, and for MicroStrategy, whose stock has risen from about $92 in mid-March to nearly $400 at the end of the year. The price of Bitcoin rose more than $10,000 in December alone. Saylor has done something unusual, turning his unremarkable software company into more like a Bitcoin investment vehicle that happens to make software. (Saylor, while bombastic on Twitter about his venture, has denied that his company‚Äôs huge cryptocurrency holdings qualify it as an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which carries with it certain regulatory burdens.) Other companies have bought Bitcoin: The payments company Square, which is helmed by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, bought $50 million worth in October 2020. But none have made such a project of it, orienting the company around accumulating a chaotic currency that also happens to be an environmental catastrophe. But whatever you think of Bitcoin, Michael Saylor‚Äôs own story is more complicated, calling into question what we should expect from Bitcoin‚Äôs latest rally. After founding MicroStrategy in 1989, Saylor was part of an alleged accounting scheme that vastly overstated the company‚Äôs earnings, making a money-losing, publicly traded corporation look profitable. In 2000, Saylor, two other MicroStrategy executives, and the company itself paid a total of $11 million in a settlement with the SEC; Saylor, who personally signed off on the fraudulent earnings reports, paid $8.2 million of that. The charges were settled with no one admitting any wrongdoing. Somehow, Saylor has held onto his role at MicroStrategy over the last 20 years, reportedly becoming one of the richest people in the capital region. The company‚Äôs revenue has declined every year since 2014. A critic of Covid-19 lockdown measures, Saylor exhibits many of the libertarian-inflected tendencies of the Bitcoin true believer. For him and his ilk, Bitcoin is an asset in which funds may be parked (and hopefully grow in value) while mostly outside the reach of the government-managed economic system. Like goldbugs, they have a distrust of federal authority and think that the economic lesson of the Covid-19 crisis is that scarcity reigns‚Äîin fact, should reign‚Äîand that central banks, by simply printing money through quantitative easing and relief efforts like the Cares Act, are risking inflation and cheapening the value of the dollar. The virtue of Bitcoin is that it‚Äôs limited‚Äîaccording to the code underpinning the cryptocurrency, only 21 million Bitcoin will ever be ‚Äúminted,‚Äù with about 18.5 million already in circulation‚Äîso better to get in as soon as possible. Even Saylor, who has also called Bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù has his regrets about not buying more earlier: ‚ÄúI wish I knew then what I know now,‚Äù he told a journalist in September. Saylor described his company‚Äôs decision as a way of dodging inflation, taxes, and fees, and putting extra capital to more productive use. He says that the company will hold onto its Bitcoin for 100 years. But a company struggling to increase revenue that chooses to put its cash reserves into a speculative digital cryptocurrency is reason enough to take pause. Saylor and MicroStrategy‚Äôs history of alleged fraud is another one. The truth is that Bitcoin, unlike gold, is worthless.* It doesn‚Äôt do anything; it has no inherent value and can‚Äôt be converted to some other purpose. It‚Äôs not backed by a government, making it most useful to transnational crime networks, intelligence agencies, and anyone else looking to keep some assets off the books. The electricity cost of creating, or ‚Äúmining,‚Äù a Bitcoin‚Äîwhich requires accessing the Bitcoin network and making a complicated mathematical calculation that requires tremendous computer power‚Äîmakes it indefensible. (The more Bitcoin that are mined, the more complicated the calculations become.) Bitcoin works, if at all, because a band of rich speculators has decided it should. Institutional investors are pouring billions into Bitcoin, which some analysts think account for much of its movement in recent months. MicroStrategy itself counts the finance giant BlackRock as its biggest outside shareholder. (Saylor has said that he thinks much Bitcoin trading data is inaccurate.) But just because Bitcoin is volatile and potentially worthless doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money from it. ‚ÄúBuy low, sell high‚Äù applies as easily to Bitcoin as it does to MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock (which Citigroup downgraded to a ‚Äúsell‚Äù rating in response to the cryptocurrency purchases). On Monday, MicroStrategy transferred 50,000 shares of Class A company stock to Alcantara LLC, of which Saylor is the sole owner. Many executives exercise stock options through private investment vehicles‚Äîand Saylor reportedly controls another company called Aeromar Management Co. LLC‚Äîbut there is something strange about the move. According to SEC filings, until just a few days ago Alcantara hadn‚Äôt received any MicroStrategy stock, or any other securities, since March 2012. Whatever Saylor is up to, Bitcoin isn‚Äôt the only thing he‚Äôs changed his mind about. * This article originally mischaracterized the value of gold. Jacob Silverman is a contributing editor at The New Republic and the author of Terms of Service: Social Media and the Price of Constant Connection.

,,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Demand to Skyrocket Tenfold, Says Michael Saylor","  Sign up Sign in Abiodun Ajayi Follow InsiderFinance Wire --   The co-founder of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, is optimistic that the coming year will witness a groundbreaking period, not only for Bitcoin but also for the entire financial landscape. Saylor, who serves as the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, reasserted his strong support for BTC during an interview with CNBC. He firmly believes that Bitcoin is on the verge of experiencing a price surge that is unprecedented in the history of modern finance. Saylor‚Äôs confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential is rooted in several upcoming events related to the cryptocurrency. Firstly, BTC is scheduled to undergo a ‚Äúhalving‚Äù event in April, which will reduce the rewards received by BTC miners by 50%. This reduction is expected to significantly limit the influx of newly mined BTC into the market. Furthermore, speculations are circulating within the financial industry that the first-ever spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), a long-awaited development yet to receive approval from U.S. regulators, may finally be authorized as early as Christmas. This approval would open the doors for more mainstream investors to access and invest in cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see $12 billion of natural selling per year converted into $6 billion of natural selling a year ‚Äî at the same time as things like spot Bitcoin ETFs increase the demand for Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor said of the near-term BTC climate. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why all of us are fairly bullish over the next 12 months: demand‚Äôs going to increase, supply‚Äôs going to contract, and this is fairly unprecedented in the history of Wall Street.‚Äù Saylor elaborated on his conviction that with significant investments from major financial institutions, centralized entities will not only bring stability to BTC but also play a role in bolstering the entire cryptocurrency sector, resulting in a substantial increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs value. Saylor expressed, ‚ÄúAs Wall Street banks and trustworthy custodians take charge of BTC, and the industry shifts its focus away from the various speculative tokens that have diverted attention and eroded shareholder value, I believe the industry will advance to a new level, and we could see a tenfold increase from our current position.‚Äù BTC has experienced a notable upswing in recent weeks. Towards the end of the previous month, the cryptocurrency saw a remarkable 11% surge, reaching $31,000, largely driven by the excitement surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. This upward momentum has persisted, reaching its zenith at $35,878 in the past week, marking a new record for the year 2023. At the time of writing, according to CoinGecko, BTC is currently valued at $34,903. In a noteworthy development earlier this week, Bernstein, an investment research firm that had previously been skeptical about BTC‚Äôs potential, made a bullish prediction. They forecasted that, given the genuine possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF gaining approval, the cryptocurrency could reach a value of $150,000 by the year 2025. It‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high was achieved in November 2021, when it briefly exceeded $69,000. Thanks for being a part of our community! Before you go: Distraction-free reading.

,,Don‚Äôt Fall for the Double Your Bitcoin Scam Stealing Crypto,"Written by: Stelian Pilici Published on: November 2, 2023 Promises of doubling your Bitcoin may sound tempting, but beware. Websites offering to magically multiply your crypto are scams designed to steal your funds. This article exposes the deceptive techniques used in the ‚ÄúDouble Your Bitcoin‚Äù scam so you can identify the warning signs and protect your cryptocurrency.  This Article Contains: The Double Your Bitcoins scam operates through fraudulent websites that lure victims with bold promises like ‚ÄúDouble your Bitcoin today!‚Äù or ‚ÄúEarn 10X returns on your crypto!‚Äù These sites entice users to send cryptocurrency deposits with the false promise of returning exponentially multiplied funds later. However, it‚Äôs simply a deception aimed at stealing digital assets. To appear more legitimate, many scammers exploit famous personalities and brands. For example, a scam site may feature images of Elon Musk or use Tesla branding without permission. Copy might read ‚ÄúElon Musk is giving away free crypto!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTesla is doubling Bitcoin deposits for a limited time!‚Äù This tactic relies on the public‚Äôs trust in these elite figures to make the con appear credible and solvent. Other scam sites feature names and photos of celebrities like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet, or Chamath Palihapitiya. Their identities provide an air of credibility. Scammers think posts stating ‚ÄúZuckerberg is tripling any Bitcoin you send for 24 hours only!‚Äù or ‚ÄúWarren Buffet is giving away $10 million in BTC!‚Äù will dupe unsuspecting victims. Of course, these famous billionaires never actually endorse any Double Your Bitcoin scams. All statements and affiliations are completely fabricated without consent. But for the average user, it can be convincing to see global celebrities purportedly guaranteeing amazing crypto returns.  Beyond fake celebrity ties, plenty of other red flags should make these investment sites highly suspicious: Reality is the scammers behind most Double Your Bitcoin cons operate anonymously. They use fabricated personas, addresses, and corporate details. This prevents angry victims and authorities from tracking them down. Many scam sites also try to come across as legal businesses meeting compliance standards. But further inspection reveals the company info they list is utterly false. Any licenses or documentation is made up. This prevents holding the scammers legally accountable. So in summary, don‚Äôt fall for the Double Your Bitcoin scam no matter what trusting personalities they associate themselves with. Their fraudulent sites have no relation to actual celebrities. And their investment promises are a mirage designed to surreptitiously steal your hard-earned cryptocurrency. The fraudsters behind Double Your Bitcoin scams rely on social engineering techniques to manipulate and deceive victims. Their sites are specifically designed to exploit human psychology and emotions like greed, fear of missing out (FOMO), and risk-taking. Here is a step-by-step look at how these scams work to steal cryptocurrency: The first point of contact is often through ads on social platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter. Scammers will place paid ads promoting huge crypto earnings. When victims click these ads, they get funneled directly to the scam site. Referral links posted on forums, in Telegram groups or sent via email also bypass search engines and send users straight to the scammer‚Äôs site. Once on the site, users see claims of being able to ‚Äúdouble your Bitcoin in just 24 hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúEarn 10x returns on your crypto deposits‚Äù. These statements promise way above market returns and appeal strongly to human greed and desires for wealth. Fake reviews, testimonials and income statements further reinforce that users can earn huge profits quickly by sending crypto deposits first. After highlighting the potential for enormous profits, the scam site provides a crypto wallet address and instructs users to deposit funds. Often they emphasize that to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù bonuses, take advantage of ‚Äúlimited time offers‚Äù or earn the advertised returns, you must send crypto first. Some tricks used to encourage deposits: Once the scammers have collected deposits in their wallet, victims never see those funds returned or any profits. The website may show fake balances increasing, fake mining statuses, etc. but no payments ever get sent back. After some time, the scammers take down the site and abscond with the stolen crypto. Victims lose all the cryptocurrency they deposited, which can sometimes be their life savings. Here are detailed sections on how to spot the Double Your Bitcoin scam on Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok, including examples. The content is optimized for SEO and readability. Many Double Your Bitcoin scam websites illegally exploit famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk to fabricate false credibility. By using celebrity names and brands without permission, these crypto scammers aim to manipulate victims into trusting their platforms. For example, a fraudulent site may claim ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äôs Tesla Wallet will double your BTC deposits instantly!‚Äù using Elon‚Äôs photo. Another site might state ‚ÄúElon Musk is giving away 5000 free Bitcoins to the first 1000 people who sign up today!‚Äù These sites take advantage of Elon Musk‚Äôs public image as a visionary innovator and cryptocurrency supporter. By falsely implying endorsement or involvement from Musk, scammers hope victims will believe their lies and send crypto deposits. In reality, Elon Musk and Tesla have no association with any Bitcoin doubling scams. No mainstream celebrity or corporation is partnering with these criminal schemes to multiply cryptocurrency. Any site associate a famous name like Elon Musk with doubling Bitcoin or crypto giveaways is 100% fraudulent. Other well-known figures scammers exploit include: Scam sites will claim these famous entrepreneurs are ‚Äúbacking‚Äù or ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù new Bitcoin doublers. Some even photoshop celebrity images receiving large crypto payouts from the scammers themselves. This social engineering provides victims a false sense of security right before the fraudsters steal their deposits. The bottom line is no major celebrity has endorsed or invested in any platform doubling cryptocurrency. Online users should immediately become suspicious if a site uses a famous person to promote improbable crypto returns. These scammers are only leveraging unethical tricks to defraud real victims. The scammers behind the Double Your Bitcoin scam aggressively promote their fraudulent websites on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok. Here are some tips to identify these scam ads and posts: For example, an ad might read ‚ÄúDouble your BTC in 24 hours! Click now before this exclusive opportunity disappears!‚Äù But the link actually redirects to a scam site called ‚Äúbtc-doubler.co‚Äù instead of a legitimate company page. For example, a post may use Elon Musk‚Äôs image claiming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving away 5000 BTC! First come first serve!‚Äù But the account name is ‚Äú@mr_elunmusk‚Äù instead of the real ‚Äú@elonmusk‚Äù verified account. For example, a video might claim ‚ÄúDeposit 0.1 BTC and get 1 full BTC sent back instantly!‚Äù But the comments are full of bots saying ‚ÄúI got rich so fast, best method ever!‚Äù The above tips can help users across Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok recognize the hallmarks of the Double Your Bitcoin scam. Stay vigilant and always verify dubious claims before sending any money or cryptocurrency. While ads and social media posts may direct victims to scam platforms, learning how to recognize fraudulent Bitcoin doubler sites is key to avoiding this trap. Here are some tips: For example, a site might be titled ‚Äúbest-bitcoinmultiplier.site‚Äù with a homepage claiming ‚ÄúDouble your BTC every 6 hours! Deposit now to reserve your profits!‚Äù But the About Us page is lorem ipsum placeholder text. Stay vigilant and think critically before depositing any crypto. Cross reference scam techniques to avoid becoming another victim of malicious Bitcoin doubling websites. If you have fallen prey to the Double Your Bitcoin scam and deposited crypto into one of these fraudulent websites, take the following steps immediately: If you have sent crypto once and are being pressured to send more to ‚Äúunlock your balance‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplete verification‚Äù, cease all transactions. The scam site will never pay out no matter how much more you deposit. Cut your losses and stop sending more money. Use a blockchain explorer tool to look up the wallet address you sent funds to. Monitor this address to see if the scammers cash out your crypto to exchanges or other wallets. This info can help law enforcement potentially track them down. Report the scam site, wallet addresses and any other related info to authorities such as the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Provide as many specifics as possible. The more victims who report, the higher priority these scams become for prosecution. If you purchased the crypto you deposited on major exchanges, contact their fraud departments. Alert them to the scam wallet addresses so they can potentially blacklist them from trading. If you reused passwords across the scam site and your other crypto exchange/wallet accounts, change them immediately. Also setup two-factor authentication (2FA) if you haven‚Äôt already for enhanced security. Spread awareness about the scam to prevent more victims. Post on social channels, forums, contact publishers of referral links, etc. The more the crypto community calls out these scams, the less people will fall for them. Depending on the amount stolen, you may want to explore legal avenues to try recovering funds or taking civil/criminal action against the scammers. A lawyer can advise you on viable options based on your specific case. Many people have questions about the ‚ÄúDouble Your Bitcoin‚Äù websites and how these crypto scams operate. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions: The Double Your Bitcoin scam involves fraudulent websites that entice victims to send cryptocurrency deposits with the false promise of receiving doubled or multiplied returns. However, once victims send funds to the provided wallet addresses, the scammers steal their money. Scammers rely heavily on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok to promote their scam sites. They use paid ads, fake accounts, bots, and referral links to direct victims to their fraudulent platforms. These fraudsters exploit human psychology and emotions like greed, fear of missing out, and risk-taking. Their sites feature fake reviews, celebrity endorsements, urgency tactics, and other social engineering tricks to manipulate victims. No, absolutely not. There is no legitimate way to double complex assets like cryptocurrency in just hours or days. Any site promising such outrageous returns is guaranteed to be a scam. Red flags include impossible returns, fake testimonials, celebrity photos, lack of company details, pressure to act fast, grammatical errors, and no maximum deposit limits. Immediately cease sending more funds. Report the site to authorities, notify your crypto exchanges, change account passwords, and consult a lawyer about legal options. Unfortunately recovery is very rare since the scammers remain anonymous. But reporting improves chances of identifying the criminals. Avoiding the scam in the first place is the best option. Yes, scamming people out of cryptocurrency is illegal. However, because the fraudsters hide their identities, they are rarely caught and prosecuted. Report scam sites, wallet addresses, and related details to the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) and other local authorities. Be skeptical of promised crypto returns exceeding market averages. Check site reputation through reviews and domain/hosting history. Enable 2FA on your accounts and choose strong passwords. The bottom line is that the Double Your Bitcoin scam is exactly that ‚Äì a scam designed to separate victims from their cryptocurrency. No website can magically double complex assets in just hours or days. Any platform making such outrageous claims should be considered highly suspicious. Remember the old saying: ‚ÄúIf it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.‚Äù Be very wary of promised crypto returns that far exceed realistic market gains. Also be skeptical of any site asking for deposits upfront in exchange for amazing profits later. Conduct due diligence on any investment opportunity and never send funds on blind faith alone. Stick to established, reputable platforms and be extra cautious around advertisers promising fast crypto riches. With crypto scams on the rise, it pays to be proactive about securing your coins. Enable 2FA on all accounts, choose strong passwords, monitor your wallet addresses and be vigilant against phishing attempts. Only you can protect your cryptocurrency from scammers. The Double Your Bitcoin scam exploits human psychology including greed and fear of missing out. But armed with knowledge of how this scam works, you can identify the warning signs and avoid becoming another victim. Spread the word so that together we can combat cryptocurrency fraud. Here are 10 basic security tips to help you avoid malware and protect your device: Use a good antivirus and keep it up-to-date. It's essential to use a good quality antivirus and keep it up-to-date to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. We are huge fans of Malwarebytes Premium and use it on all of our devices, including Windows and Mac computers as well as our mobile devices. Malwarebytes sits beside your traditional antivirus, filling in any gaps in its defenses, and providing extra protection against sneakier security threats. Keep software and operating systems up-to-date. Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Whenever an update is released for your device, download and install it right away. These updates often include security fixes, vulnerability patches, and other necessary maintenance. Be careful when installing programs and apps. Pay close attention to installation screens and license agreements when installing software. Custom or advanced installation options will often disclose any third-party software that is also being installed. Take great care in every stage of the process and make sure you know what it is you're agreeing to before you click ""Next."" Install an ad blocker. Use a browser-based content blocker, like AdGuard. Content blockers help stop malicious ads, Trojans, phishing, and other undesirable content that an antivirus product alone may not stop. Be careful what you download. A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware‚Äîprograms or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. Be alert for people trying to trick you. Whether it's your email, phone, messenger, or other applications, always be alert and on guard for someone trying to trick you into clicking on links or replying to messages. Remember that it's easy to spoof phone numbers, so a familiar name or number doesn't make messages more trustworthy. Back up your data. Back up your data frequently and check that your backup data can be restored. You can do this manually on an external HDD/USB stick, or automatically using backup software. This is also the best way to counter ransomware. Never connect the backup drive to a computer if you suspect that the computer is infected with malware. Choose strong passwords. Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don't use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it's important to follow these 10 basic safety rules. By doing so, you can protect yourself from many of the unpleasant surprises that can arise when using the web.

First, read the course syllabus. Then, enroll in the course by clicking ""Enroll me"". Click Unit 1 to read its introduction and learning outcomes. You will then see the learning materials and instructions on how to use them. What went wrong with money in the past? Why were some goods chosen to become money over others? In this unit, we explore how money serves as a coordination tool for society and how it arises in a bottom-up, spontaneous order. We also explore government intervention in the market for money. We will also discuss monetary history, what makes a good money, and why Bitcoin is well-placed to supersede prior forms of money. We will also talk about deflation and ""hoarding"", and Bitcoin's environmental impact. Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours. Why buy and hold Bitcoin? If you simply save in your local fiat currency (USD, GBP, EUR, and so on), you will be losing value over time. In this unit, we will explore this concept and why many people are now turning to Bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from the ""melting ice cube"" of fiat money. We will also explore Bitcoin's volatility, and whether it must be used as a medium of exchange in the short term to be viable. Bitcoin is moving through phases of evolution, and broadly remains uncorrelated with other assets. Bitcoin detractors also call it a Ponzi scheme or a bubble, or assert that the government will ban it. We will also address these topics. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Bitcoin wasn't formed in a vacuum. There's a rich history of cypherpunks, privacy activists, and free-market libertarians who contributed to the preceding culture and technologies. In this unit, we will contrast Bitcoin with predecessor technologies and businesses, such as BitGold, b-money, HashCash, and e-gold. Bitcoin has also faced various tests in terms of social attacks that have forced a response from the Bitcoin community to defend or strengthen Bitcoin. One interesting case is SegWit2X, where large Bitcoin businesses and miners attempted a hostile takeover of Bitcoin that was repelled by Bitcoin users. Completing this unit should take you approximately 3 hours. Bitcoin has various technical ingredients that combine to provide extraordinary properties not seen in any other form of money available today. First, Bitcoin's immutable ledger enables transactions that are extremely hard to reverse or tamper with. Bitcoin mining also provides a link between real-world energy expenditure and the security of Bitcoin's ledger. Holding your own Bitcoin private keys enables the user to have custody of their own Bitcoins and control them exclusively. Finally, running a Bitcoin node allows users to fully self-validate their Bitcoins and ensure that the rules of Bitcoin are upheld. In this unit, we will also explore some of the trade-offs of Bitcoin against altcoins, and explore how Bitcoin has no leaders but still continues to advance and develop. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Now that you have some base awareness of Bitcoin, we will cover basic instruction on putting Bitcoin into practice in this unit. This includes acquiring Bitcoin, using a Bitcoin wallet and the Lightning Network, privacy and security practices, and avoiding common pitfalls, scams, and mistakes. Completing this unit should take you approximately 2 hours. Please take a few minutes to give us feedback about this course.

,,Michael Saylor on the Coming Cryptocurrency Era,"                                          TABLE OF CONTENTS In this article, we‚Äôll examine why Michael Saylor believes Bitcoin is the up-and-coming digital gold, what the implications of that are, and why you should get in on the action now. As MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor puts it,  ‚ÄúIf God came down and created perfect gold, he would create 21 million gold coins, put them on a network that you could move at the speed of light if you wanted to, and make it impossible for anyone to create any more gold. He‚Äôd make it impossible for a bank to steal your gold. He‚Äôd make it impossible for anyone to lie to you about how much gold they had in the vault. He‚Äôd make it completely transparent when he gave it to you. That‚Äôs what Bitcoin is. It‚Äôs digital gold designed with all of the attributes that we love about gold with none of the liabilities.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs company has moved its treasury into Bitcoin and now owns almost 71,000 bitcoins.If you are a crypto enthusiast looking to expand your passport portfolio by adding crypto-friendly countries or diversifying your assets, get in touch with us today. We can help you go where you‚Äôre treated best. Michael Saylor wasn‚Äôt always a fan of Bitcoin. He felt it was just online gambling and not something he needed or really even understood. However, with the lockdowns and changes brought about by the pandemic, he began to reassess what he knew about finance and economics. The challenges of the pandemic brought an aggressive fiscal response by central banks around the world. The real result of that was that the money supply, which had been expanding by 5% every year, started expanding by 20-25% during this year.  As Michael noted, what happens when the cost of capital goes to 15% is that companies will need to change how they‚Äôre operating in order to get bigger returns to keep up. The 8% returns from our current market will not be enough. The only way you get over the hurdle rate is to either grow 20%, like Amazon, Google, or Facebook or to leverage up. You have to borrow billions, buy back stock, cut your share count in half, and that will leverage up your cash flows which are growing less than that cost of capital.  When the monetary supplies are expanding at 15% a year, that shakes people out of their comfort zone and into a search for something new. That‚Äôs how Michael Saylor discovered Bitcoin. He needed a safe haven asset that was not pegged to fiat cash flows.  He has compared owning Bitcoin to owning a block of Manhattan in cyberspace. It‚Äôs a long-duration, safe-haven asset. You can‚Äôt debase it. It‚Äôs not a fiat-based derivative like a bond or a stock.  So, if you‚Äôre looking to the long term, Michael Saylor says owning Bitcoin is like encrypting your monetary energy in a way that will preserve it without any degradation over the long term. Michael Saylor predicts that we‚Äôll start seeing an avalanche of smart CEOs and high-net-worth individuals switching over to Bitcoin.  So, Michael Saylor‚Äôs answer to what will happen when countries start to join in and want to regulate the cryptocurrency market was to ask how many years you have in your life ‚Äì because you‚Äôre wasting time not joining the next technological advancement.  As more people and then governments get involved, regulation will most likely be a part of it, and that might not be all bad. For many, regulations bring trust and ensure legitimacy ‚Äì which then brings more investors. Nomad Capitalist has helped 1,500+ high-net-worth clients grow and protect their wealth safe from high taxes and greedy governments. Learn how our legal, holistic approach can help you.                         He feels that if he shows you something with 200% returns a year ‚Äì while the average returns are 10% a year and the best returns are 20% a year ‚Äì if you wait to join in, you‚Äôre giving up the opportunity to progress. According to Saylor, gold is antiquated monetary storage that peaked in the 19th century. It‚Äôs not working now. The reason it doesn‚Äôt work is that you can corrupt it, you can confiscate it, can hypothecate it, and lie about it, and it‚Äôs impractical to move it with you should you decide you want to change locations. It no longer works in our digital age. It‚Äôs being replaced by something better ‚Äì something that moves at the speed of light and is pure monetary energy.  ‚ÄúYou can cling to gold, but it‚Äôs like clinging to your Kodak stock because you like photos instead of buying Apple. Or like Rand McNally maps compared to Google maps.‚Äù  The digital version is not a speculative asset but a digital monetary network that works better than the physical and paper monetary networks they‚Äôre replacing.  Michael Saylor urges individuals and countries that want to prosper to embrace this new digital monetary network. In terms of the future, he claims the best thing you can do is to make yourself and your property mobile.  For him, things like real estate, stocks, bonds, and even companies can lose their value or cause you to be stuck in one location. He urges you to own the most movable, liquid property on earth ‚Äì Bitcoin. Another hottest commodity of this age is a second passport. While Bitcoin may help you diversify and decentralize your assets, a second passport can help you go to crypto-friendly places and take advantage of their policies.

,,Bitcoin ETF Hype Reaches New Heights,"Sign up for FREE to get full unrestricted access to all of our digital asset news and the stories that matter in Singapore & APAC. It's time to talk about Bitcoin ETFs again as trading volumes surge 1000% We've been avoiding the elephant in the room for a while now. After a burst of spot Bitcoin ETF updates at the start of the year, we took a break from laboring about the ""revolutionary"" financial products. Not because we're too cool for school but because Bitcoin ETF news quickly became repetitive, dry, and let's be honest, predictable. More importantly, the world of digital assets and Web3 extends far beyond Bitcoin. It was our duty to dig out industry trinkets and uncover any hidden gems that were buried beneath the Bitcoin ETF coverage. We'd like to think we found some for you. You're welcome. We're now revisiting the Bitcoin scene as there have been some new developments that we probably shouldn't overlook. Before we set the ball rolling, and for consistency's sake, a little on Bitcoin's price: BTC has traded relatively sidewise after breaking the $52K barrier. Our in-house analyst believes it could soon hit $55K. VaneEck's spot Bitcoin ETF, also known as HODL, has seen its daily volume exceed $300 million. The figure represents a 1000% increase from its previous peak. Interestingly, the surge was not a result of one or two whales but due to 32,000 individual transactions, marking a 60x increase from its average. The pump has left Bloomberg ETF expert, Eric Balchunas, bewildered. ""Still haven't figured out what happened. No one knows,"" Balchunas tweeted, adding that it could even be social media driven. ""Given how sudden and explosive the increase in number of trades was (500 trades Friday, 50,000 trades today) I'm wondering if some Reddit or TikTok influencer type recommended them to their followers. Feels retail army-ish."" Still haven't figured out what happened. No one knows. Given how sudden and explosive the increase in number of trades was (500 trades Friday, 50,000 trades today) I'm wondering if some Reddit or TikTok influencer type recommended them to their followers. Feels retail army-ish. https://t.co/WazxSSgFjR Until recently, VanEck's Bitcoin ETF has been outperformed by its rivals. Grayscale's $23.76 billion and BlackRock's $5.68 billion dwarf VanEck's $187.55 million. However, VanEck's 24-hour volume of $401.1 million casts a shadow on Fidelity, Ark, and Bitwise, which have only seen $340.2 million, $141.95, and $179.15 million over the same period despite having AUMs over one billion. In response to the swing, VanEck's head of ETF products, Ed Lopez said, ""Because ETFs trade on the secondary market, it can be challenging to know who or why someone buys an ETF. Today‚Äôs trading has sported great volume at tight spreads, which is ultimately what you‚Äôd want from an ETF, whether you're bullish or bearish on the market."" Last week, VanEeck filed a notice with the SEC that it would lower its fee from 0.25% to 0.20%, effective tomorrow, 22 February. VanEck isn't the only fund that has a 24-hour volume higher than its AUM. WisdomTree has seen $223.10 million in volume over the 24-hour period despite having AUM of just $26.41. ""Typically when the daily volume is greater than an ETF's total assets (as in this case) it means one big creation,"" Balchunas explains. ""I've never seen a grassroots trading explosion come out of nowhere like this."" More interesting-ness: $BTCW also popping off, $154m trades, 12x its avg and 25x its assets via 23,000 indiv trades. For context, it saw a mere 221 trades on Friday. At the same time $IBIT volume is elevated but not crazy like this. WTF? ETF Unsolved Mysteries will continue after‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/IXQmCKuCWl Volumes in Bitcoin ETFs have amounted to almost $2 billion, which is the highest since its first day of trading back in January. The Nine had biggest volume day since Day One with about $2b in combined trading thx to big contributions from $HODL, $BTCW and $BITB which all broke their personal records. For context $2b in trading would put them in Top 10ish among ETFs and Top 20ish among stocks. It's a lot. pic.twitter.com/547pIl5grI Before the official approval of Bitcoin ETFs, Gemini co-founder  Tyler Winklevoss, told Blockhead that the most exciting aspect of onboarding institutions is liquidity. ""I think the next wave will be ETFs and that's going to bring a ton of liquidity and price discovery,"" Tyler explained. ""We have many institutional customers, and they range from proprietary trading firms to large macro hedge funds,"" he continued. ""And I think we're going to see 10x that once ETFs arrive."" True enough, Bitcoin order books are now the most liquid since October 2023. Bitcoin's 2% market depth across 33 centralized exchanges has risen to $539 million. Bitcoin's 2% market depth measures the aggregated bids and asks on BTC order books and is up 23% since the end of November and by 30% year-over-year to $485mn. ""The increase in liquidity has been driven by U.S. platforms and is likely linked to the spot ETF approvals,"" Kaiko explains. ""The market share of BTC market depth on U.S. vs. global exchanges has increased consistently since November, exceeding 50% since late 2023."" Greater liquidity means easier access and less slippage between trading prices. Bitcoin super bull Michael Saylor believes the cryptocurrency spot ETFs are yet another reason to stay long. The MicroStrategy CEO said, ""The spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem."" ""[The ETFs] are facilitating the digital transformation of capital, and every day hundreds of millions of dollars of capital is flowing from the traditional analog ecosystem into the digital economy."" MicroStrategy bought another 16,130 BTC in December, totaling a balance of 190,000 Bitcoin in January. Saylor isn't intending on selling any of it. MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 16,130 BTC for ~$593.3 million at an average price of $36,785 per #bitcoin. As of 11/29/23, @MicroStrategy now hodls 174,530 $BTC acquired for ~$5.28 billion at an average price of $30,252 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/hSEZyzGBsr ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be buying the top forever, Bitcoin is the exit strategy,"" he explained, adding that the cryptocurrency is stronger than gold. ‚ÄúWe believe capital is going to keep flowing from those asset classes into Bitcoin because Bitcoin is technically superior to those asset classes and that being the case, there‚Äôs just no reason to sell the winner and to buy the losers.‚Äù Looking beyond ETH ETFs, Ethereum's shrinking supply, deflationary position, restaking, and data blobs, are all reasons to back the world's second biggest cryptocurrency Can the Solana Saga 2 and the Aptos-integrated $99 JamboPhone warrant the legitimate need for a Web3 smartphone? Blockhead presents our favorite stories this week, Bitcoin's return to $50K, Ether Rock's potential $600K sale, Coinbase's return to profit, Crypto.com's Hong Kong license application, and Franklin Templeton's ETH ETF race An Ether Rock NFT is expected to fetch $600,000 at a Sotheby's auction but are we in enough of a bull market to justify its price? Avalanche's token unlock could lead to further selling pressure on AVAX. Starknet's STRK token took center stage with its debut this week, but airdrop recipients chose to sell. The guidelines align Hong Kong's regulatory framework with international best practices, positioning the region as a leading global center for digital asset innovation and investment.

,,"Michael Saylor: Bitcoin, Inflation, and the Future of Money | Lex Fridman Podcast #276","  Sign up Sign in Stephen Chow Follow 1   Link to the YouTube video: https://youtu.be/mC43pZkpTec Lex Fridman: Let‚Äôs start with a big question of truth and wisdom. When advanced humans or aliens or AI systems ‚Äî let‚Äôs say 5‚Äì10 centuries from now ‚Äî look back at Earth on this early 21st century, how much do you think they would say we understood about money and economics? Or even about engineering, science, life, death, meaning, intelligence, consciousness ‚Äî all the big, interesting questions? Michael Saylor: I think they would probably give us a B- on engineering, on all the engineering things ‚Äî the hard sciences. Lex Fridman: A passing grade? Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre doing okay! We‚Äôre working our way through rockets and jets and electric cars and electricity transport systems and nuclear power and space flight and the like. And if you look at the walls that grace the Great Court at MIT, it‚Äôs full of all the great thinkers and they‚Äôre all pretty admirable. If you could be with Newton or Gauss or Madame Curie or Einstein, you would respect them. I would say they‚Äôd give us like an F+ or a D- on economics. Lex Fridman: You have an optimistic vision ‚Äî first of all, an optimistic vision of engineering, because most people you‚Äôve listed is just over the past couple of centuries. And maybe it stretches a little farther back, but mostly all the cool stuff we‚Äôve done in engineering is the past couple of centuries. Michael Saylor: I mean, Archimedes had his virtues. I studied the history of science at MIT and I also studied aerospace engineering and so I clearly have a bias in favor of science. And if I look at the past 10,000 years and I consider all of the philosophy and the politics and their impact on the human condition, I think it‚Äôs a wash. For every politician that came up with a good idea, another politician came up with a bad idea. And it‚Äôs not clear to me that most of the political and philosophical contributions to the human race and the human conditions have advanced so much. I mean we‚Äôre still taking guidance and admiring Aristotle and Plato and Seneca and the like, and on the other hand, if you think about what has made the human condition better ‚Äî fire, water, harnessing of wind energy ‚Äî like, try to row across an ocean, right? Not easy. Lex Fridman: And for people who are just listening or watching, there‚Äôs a beautiful sexy ship from the 16th-17th century? Michael Saylor: This is a 19th century handmade model of a 17th century sailing ship which is of the type that the Dutch East India Company used to sail the world and trade. So the original was made sometime in the 1600s, and then this model was made in the 19th century by individuals. Lex Fridman: Both the model and the ship itself is engineering at its best. And just imagine ‚Äî just like rockets flying out to space ‚Äî how much hope this filled people with: exploring the unknown, going into the mystery. Both the entrepreneurs and the business people and the engineers and just humans ‚Äî what‚Äôs out there? What‚Äôs out there to be discovered? Michael Saylor: Yeah the metaphor of human beings leaving shore or sailing across the horizon risking their lives in pursuit of a better life is an incredibly powerful one. In 1900, I suppose the average life expectancy was 50. During the Revolutionary War, while our founding fathers were fighting to establish life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, the Constitution, average life expectancy was somewhere between 32 and 36. So all the sound and the fury doesn‚Äôt make you live past 32, but what does? Antibiotics ‚Äî conquest of infectious diseases. If we understand the science of infectious disease ‚Äî sterilizing a knife and harnessing antibiotics gets you from 50 to 70, and that happened fast. That happens from 1900 to 1950 or something like that. And I think if you look at the human condition ‚Äî you ever get on one of those rowing machines where they actually keep track of your watts output when you‚Äôre on it? 200 is a lot, okay? 200 is a lot. So a kilowatt hour is like all the energy that a trained athlete can deliver in a day, and probably not 1% of the people in the world could deliver a kilowatt hour in a day. And the commercial value of a kilowatt hour ‚Äî the retail value ‚Äî is 11 cents today, and the wholesale value is 2 cents. So you have to look at the contribution of politicians and philosophers and economists to the human condition, and it‚Äôs like at best a wash ‚Äî one way or the other. And then if you look at the contribution of John D. Rockefeller when he delivered you a barrel of oil and the energy in oil ‚Äî liquid energy ‚Äî or the contribution of Tesla as we deliver electricity. And what‚Äôs the impact of the human condition if I have electric power? If I have chemical power? If I have wind energy? If I can actually set up a reservoir, create a dam, spin a turbine, and generate energy from a hydraulic source? That‚Äôs extraordinary, right? And so our ability to cross the ocean, our ability to grow food, our ability to live ‚Äî it‚Äôs technology that gets the human race from a brutal life where life expectancy is 30 to a world where life expectancy is 80. Lex Fridman [timestamp 8:19]: You gave a D- the economists. So are they too, like the politicians, a wash? In terms of: there‚Äôs good ideas and bad ideas, and that tiny delta between good and bad is how you squeak past the F+ onto the D- territory? Michael Saylor: I think most economic ideas are bad ideas. Like, take us back to MIT and you want to solve a fluid dynamics problem: design the shape of the hull of that ship, or you want to design an airfoil ‚Äî a wing ‚Äî or if you want to design an engine or a nozzle in a rocket ship. You wouldn‚Äôt do it with simple arithmetic. You wouldn‚Äôt do it with a scalar. There‚Äôs not a single number, right? It‚Äôs vector math. Computational fluid dynamics is n-dimensional higher-level math ‚Äî complicated stuff. So when when an economist says, The inflation rate is 2%, that‚Äôs a scalar. And when an economist says, It‚Äôs not a problem to print more money because the velocity of the money is very low ‚Äî the monetary velocity is low ‚Äî that‚Äôs another scalar, okay? So the truth of the matter is: inflation is not a scalar. Inflation is an n-dimensional vector. Money velocity is not a scalar. Saying, What‚Äôs the velocity of money? Oh, it‚Äôs slow or it‚Äôs fast ‚Äî it ignores the question of what medium is the money moving through? In the same way that, What‚Äôs the speed of sound? Okay, well what is sound? Sound is a compression wave. It‚Äôs energy moving through a medium. But the speed is different! So for example, the speed of sound through air is different than the speed of sound through water, and sound moves faster through water. It moves faster through a solid and it moves faster through a stiffer solid. So there isn‚Äôt one. Lex Fridman: What is the fundamental problem with the way economists reduce the world down to a model? Is it too simple? Or is it just even the first principles of constructing the model is wrong? Michael Saylor: I think that the fundamental problem is: if you see the world as a scalar, you simply pick the one number which supports whatever you want to do, and you ignore the universe of other consequences from your behavior. Lex Fridman: In general ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard of like Eric Weinstein has been talking about this with Gauge theory. So different kinds of approaches from the physics world, from the mathematical world, to extend past this scalar view of economics. So Gauge theory is one way that comes from physics. Do you find that way of exploring economics interesting? So outside of cryptocurrency, outside of the actual technologies and so on, just analysis of how economics works ‚Äî do you find that interesting? Michael Saylor: Yeah I think that if we‚Äôre going to want to really make any scientific progress in economics, we have to apply much more computationally-intensive and richer forms of mathematics. Lex Fridman: So a simulation, perhaps? Michael Saylor: Yeah, when I was at MIT I studied system dynamics ‚Äî they taught it at the Sloan School. It was developed by Jay Forrester, who was an extraordinary computer scientist. And when we‚Äôve created models of economic behavior, they were all multi-dimensional non-linear models. So if you want to describe how anything works in the real world, you have to start with the concept of feedback. If I double the price of something, demand will fall, and attempts to create supply will increase. And there will be a delay before the capacity increases, there‚Äôll be an instant demand change, and there‚Äôll be rippling effects throughout every other segment of the economy downstream and upstream of such a thing. So it‚Äôs kind of common sense, but most economics, most classical economics, it‚Äôs always taught with fairly simplistic linear models. And oftentimes even ‚Äî I‚Äôm really shocked today that the entire mainstream dialogue of economics has been captured by scalar arithmetic. For example, if you read any article in New York Times or the Wall Street Journal they just refer to an inflation number or the CPI or the inflation rate is x, and if you look at all the historic studies of the impact of inflation, generally they‚Äôre all based upon the idea that inflation equals CPI and then they try to extrapolate from that, and you just get nowhere with it. Lex Fridman: So at the very least we should be considering inflation and other economics concepts as a non-linear dynamical system. So non-linearity, and also just embracing the full complexity of just how the variables interact, maybe through simulation, maybe have some interesting models around that? Michael Saylor: Wouldn‚Äôt it be refreshing if somebody ‚Äî for once ‚Äî published a table of the change in price of every product, every service, and every asset, in every place over time? Lex Fridman: You said table ‚Äî some of that also is the task of visualization: how to extract from this complex set of numbers patterns that somehow indicate something fundamental about what‚Äôs happening. So like: summarization of data is still important. Perhaps summarization not down to a single scalar value, but looking at that whole sea of numbers, you have to find patterns. Like, what is inflation in a particular sector? What is maybe change over time? Maybe different geographical regions? Things of that nature. I think that‚Äôs kind of ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know even what that task is. You could look at machine learning. You can look at AI with that perspective, which is like, How do you represent what‚Äôs happening as efficiently as possible? That‚Äôs never going to be a single number, but it might be a compressed model that captures something beautiful, something fundamental about what‚Äôs happening. Michael Saylor [15:09]: It‚Äôs an opportunity for sure right? If we take for example during the pandemic: the response of the political apparatus was to lower interest rates to zero and to start buying assets ‚Äî in essence, printing money ‚Äî and the defense was there‚Äôs no inflation. But of course, you had one part of the economy where it was locked down so it was illegal to buy anything. It was either illegal or it was impractical, so it would be impossible for demand to manifest ‚Äî so of course there is no inflation. On the other hand, there was instantaneous immediate inflation in another part of the economy. for example you lowered the interest rates to zero. At one point we saw the swap rate on the 30-year note go to 72 basis points. Okay that means that the value of a long dated bond immediately inflates. So the bond market had hyper inflation within minutes of these financial decisions. The asset market had hyperinflation. We had what we affectionately call a k-shaped recovery: main street shutdown, Wall Street recovered all within six weeks. The inflation was in the assets: in the stocks, in the bonds. If you look today you see that a typical house according to Case-Shiller index today is up 19.2% year-over-year. So if you‚Äôre a first-time home buyer, the inflation rate is 19%. The formal CPI announced a 7.9%. You can pretty much create any inflation rate you want by constructing a market basket ‚Äî a weighted basket of products or services or assets that yield you the answer. I think that the fundamental failing of economist is first of all they don‚Äôt really have a term for asset inflation. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs an asset? What‚Äôs asset hyperinflation? You mentioned bond market swap rate, and assets is where the all majority of the hyperinflation happened. What‚Äôs inflation? What‚Äôs hyperinflation? What‚Äôs an asset? What‚Äôs an asset market? I‚Äôm going to ask so many dumb questions. Michael Saylor: In the conventional economic world you would treat inflation as the rate of increase in price of a market basket of consumer products defined by a government agency. Lex Fridman: So they have a like traditional things that a regular consumer would be buying the government selects like toilet paper, food, toaster, refrigerator, electronics, all that kind of stuff? And it‚Äôs like a representative basket of goods that lead to a content existence on this Earth for a regular consumer? Michael Saylor: They define a synthetic metric, right? I mean, I‚Äôm going to say you should have a thousand square foot apartment and you should have a used car and you should eat three hamburgers a week. Now ten years go by and the apartment costs more ‚Äî I could adjust the market basket. They call them hedonic adjustments. I could decide that it used to be in 1978 you had a thousand square feet but in the year 2020 you only need 700 square feet because we‚Äôve many miniaturized televisions and we‚Äôve got more efficient electric appliances and because things have collapsed into the iPhone and you just don‚Äôt need as much space. So now it may be that the apartment costs 50% more but after the hedonic adjustment there is no inflation because I just downgraded the expectation of what a normal person should have. Lex Fridman: So the synthetic nature of the metric allows for manipulation by people in power? Michael Saylor: Pretty much. I guess my criticism of the economist is: rather than embracing inflation based upon its fundamental idea which is the rate at which the price of things go up, they‚Äôve been captured by mainstream conventional thinking to immediately equate inflation to the government issued CPI or government-issued PCE or government-issued PPI measure, which was never the rate at which things go up, it‚Äôs simply the rate at which a synthetic basket of products and services the government wishes to track go up. Now the problem with that is two big things: one thing is the government gets to create the market basket and so they keep changing what‚Äôs in the basket over time. So if I said three years ago you should go see ten concerts a year and the concert tickets now cost two hundred dollars each now it‚Äôs two thousand dollars a year to go see concerts now. I‚Äôm in charge of calculating inflation, so i redefine your entertainment quota for the year to be eight Netflix streaming concerts and now they don‚Äôt cost two thousand dollars, they cost nothing and there is no inflation, but you don‚Äôt get your concerts, right? So the problem starts with continually changing the definition of the market basket. But in my opinion that‚Äôs not the biggest problem. The more egregious problem is the fundamental idea that assets aren‚Äôt products or services. Assets can‚Äôt be inflated. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs an asset? Michael Saylor: A house. A share of Apple stock. A bond. A Bitcoin is an asset. Or a Picasso painting. Lex Fridman: So not a consumable good, not an apple that you can eat Michael Saylor: Right. If I throw away an asset then I‚Äôm not on the hook to track the inflation rate for it. So what happens if I change the policy such that ‚Äî let‚Äôs take the classic example: a million dollar bond at a five percent interest rate gives you fifty thousand dollars a year in risk-free income. you might retire on fifty thousand dollars a year in a low-cost jurisdiction. So the cost of social security or early retirement is one million dollars when the interest rate is five percent. During the crisis of march of 2020 the interest rate went on a 10-year bond went to 50 basis points. Okay so now the cost of that bond is 10 million dollars. the cost of social security went from a million dollars to 10 million dollars. So if you wanted to work your entire life, save money, and then retire risk-free and live happily ever after on a $50,000 salary living on a beach in Mexico wherever you wanted to go, you had hyperinflation. The cost of your aspiration increased by a factor of 10 over the course of some amount of time. In fact, in that case that was like over the course of about 12 years. As the inflation rate ground down, the asset traded up, but the conventional view is: Oh that‚Äôs not a problem because it‚Äôs good that assets, the bond is highly priced because we own the bond. Or, what‚Äôs the problem with the inflation rate in housing being 19%? It‚Äôs an awful problem for a 22-year old that‚Äôs starting their first job that‚Äôs saving money to buy a house, but it would be characterized as a benefit to society by a conventional economist who would say, Well, asset values are higher because of interest rate fluctuation and now the economy‚Äôs got more wealth. And so that‚Äôs viewed as a benefit. Lex Fridman: So what‚Äôs being missed here? Like, the suffering of the average person? Or the struggle, the suffering, the pain of the average person, like metrics that [don‚Äôt] capture that within the economic system? Michael Saylor: One way to say it is: a conventional view of inflation as CPI understates the human misery that‚Äôs in inflicted upon the working class and on mainstream companies by the political class. And so it‚Äôs a massive shift of wealth from the working class to the property class. It‚Äôs a massive shift of power from the free market to the centrally governed or the controlled market. It‚Äôs a massive shift of power from the people to the government. and maybe one more illustrative point here, Lex is: what do you think the inflation rate‚Äôs been for the past 100 years? Lex Fridman: Are you talking about the scalar again? Michael Saylor: If you took a survey of everybody on the street and you asked them what do they think inflation was? What is it? Remember when Jerome Powell said our target‚Äôs two percent but we‚Äôre not there? If you go around the corner I have posted the deed to this house, sold in 1930. And the number on that deed is one hundred thousand dollars in 1930. And if you go on Zillow and you get the Z-estimate ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Is it higher than that? Michael Saylor [timestamp 25:00]: $30,500,000. so that‚Äôs 92 years, 1930 to 2022, and in 92 years we‚Äôve had a 305x increase in price of the house. Now if you actually back calculate you can you come to a conclusion that the inflation rate was approximately 6.5% a year every year for 92 years, okay? And there‚Äôs nobody ‚Äî nobody in government, no conventional economist, that would ever admit to an inflation rate of 7% a year in the US dollar over the last century. Now if you dig deeper ‚Äî I mean one guy that‚Äôs done a great job working on this is Saifedean Ammous who wrote the book The Bitcoin Standard, and he notes that on average it looks like the inflation rate and the money supply is about 7% a year all the way up to the year 2020. If you look at the S&P index, which is a market basket of scarce desirable stocks, it returned about 10%. 10% a year for 100 years. The money supply is expanding at 7% over 100 years. If you actually talk to economists or you look at the economy and you ask the question how fast does the economy grow in its entirety year over year? Generally about 2%-3%. like the sum total impact of all this technology and human ingenuity might get you a 2.5%-3% improvement a year. Lex Fridman: As measured by GDP? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd go that far yet, but I would just say that if you had the human race doing stuff and if you ask the question how much more efficiently will we do the stuff next year than this year? Or what‚Äôs the value of all of our innovations and inventions and investments in the past 12 months? You‚Äôd be hard-pressed to say we get 2% better. a typical investor thinks they‚Äôre 10% better every year. So if you look at what‚Äôs going on, really when you‚Äôre holding a million dollars of stocks and you‚Äôre getting a 10% gain a year, you really get a 7% expansion of the money supply ‚Äî you‚Äôre getting a 2%-3% [real] gain under best circumstances. and another way to say that is: if the money supply stopped expanding at 7% a year the S&P yield might be 3% and not 10% ‚Äî it probably should be. Now that gets you to start to ask a bunch of other fundamental questions like: if I borrow a billion dollars and pay 3% interest and the money supply expands at 7%-10% a year and I ended up making a 10% return on a billion dollar investment paying 3% interest, is that fair? and who suffered so that I could do that? Because in an environment where you‚Äôre just inflating the money supply and you‚Äôre holding the assets constant, it stands the reason that the price of all the assets is going to appreciate somewhat proportional to the money supply. And the difference in asset appreciation is going to be a function of the scarce desirable quality of the assets and to what extent can I make more of them and to what extent are they are they truly limited in supply? Lex Fridman: Yeah so we‚Äôll get to a lot of the words you said there: the scarcity and that‚Äôs connected to how limited they are, and the value of those assets. But you also said: so the expansion of the money supply ‚Äî you just put another way, is printing money ‚Äî and so is that always bad, the expansion of the money supply? Just to put some terms on the table so we understand them: you nonchalantly say it‚Äôs always the on average expanding every year, the money supply is expanding every year by 7%. That‚Äôs a bad thing? That‚Äôs a universally bad thing? Michael Saylor [timestamp 29:17]: It‚Äôs awful. Well I guess to be precise: it‚Äôs the currency. I would say money is monetary energy or economic energy and the economic energy has to find its way into a medium, so if you want to move it rapidly as a medium of exchange it has to find its way into currency. but the money can also flow into property like a house or gold. If the money flows into property it‚Äôll probably hold its value much better than if the money flows into currency. If you had put a hundred thousand dollars in this house you would have 305x return over 92 years. But if you had put the money a hundred thousand dollars in a safe deposit box and buried it in the basement, you would have lost 99.7% of your wealth over the same time period. So the expansion of the currency creates a massive inefficiency in the society ‚Äî what I‚Äôll call an adiabatic lapse. what we‚Äôre doing is we‚Äôre bleeding the civilization to death. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs the word, adiabatic? Michael Saylor: Adiabatic lapse. In aerospace engineering, you want to solve any problem, they start with the phrase, Assume an adiabatic system. And what that means is a closed system. So I‚Äôve got a container and in that container no air leaves and no air enters, no energy exits or enters, so it‚Äôs a closed system. Lex Fridman: So you‚Äôve got a closed system lapse. There‚Äôs a leak in the ship. Michael Saylor: Okay, I‚Äôm going to use a physical metaphor for you because you‚Äôre into jujitsu. Like, you‚Äôve got 10 pints of blood in your body? And so before your next workout I‚Äôm going to take one pint from you. Now you‚Äôre going to go exercise but you‚Äôve lost 10% of your blood. Okay? You‚Äôre not going to perform as well ‚Äî it takes about one month for your body to replace the red blood platelets. So what if I tell you every month you‚Äôve got to show up and I‚Äôm going to bleed you? So if I‚Äôm draining the energy, I‚Äôm draining the blood from your body, you can‚Äôt perform. Adiabatic lapse is: when you go up in altitude, every thousand feet, you lose three degrees. You go up 50,000 feet you‚Äôre 150 degrees colder than sea level. that‚Äôs why you look at your instruments and instead of 80 degrees your -70 degrees. Why is the temperature falling? Temperatures falling because it‚Äôs not a closed system, it‚Äôs an open system. as the air expands, the density falls. The energy per cubic whatever falls and therefore the temperature falls, right? The heat‚Äôs falling out of the solution. so when you‚Äôre inflating ‚Äî let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre inflating the currency supply by 6% ‚Äî you‚Äôre sucking 6% of the energy out of the fluid that the economy is using to function. Lex Fridman: So this ocean of currency, for the economy to function ‚Äî it‚Äôs being inefficient when you expand the money supply? It‚Äôs how you do transactions at a scale of billions? Michael Saylor [timestamp 32:56]: Currency is the asset we use to move monetary energy around. And you could use the dollar or you could use the peso or you could use the bolivar. Lex Fridman: Selling houses and buying houses is much more inefficient. Or like, you can‚Äôt transact between billions of people with houses. Michael Saylor: Yeah, properties don‚Äôt make such good mediums of exchange. they make better stores of value, and they they have utility value if it‚Äôs a ship or a house or a plane or a bushel of corn. Lex Fridman: Can I zoom out? Can we keep zooming out until we reach the origin of human civilization but on the way ask: you gave economists a D-. I‚Äôm not even going to ask you what you give to governments. Do you think their failure ‚Äî economist and government failure ‚Äî is malevolence? Or incompetence? Michael Saylor: I think policymakers are well-intentioned but generally all government policy is inflammatory and inflationary. So what I mean by that is: when you have a policy pursuing supply chain independence, if you have an energy policy, if you have a labor policy, if you have a trade policy, if you have any kind of foreign policy, a domestic policy, a manufacturing policy, medical policy ‚Äî every one of these policies interferes with the free market and generally prevents some rational actor from doing it in a cheaper, more efficient way. So when you layer them on top of each other, they all have to be paid for. if you want to shut down the entire economy for a year, you have to pay for it. If you want to fight a war, you have to pay for it. If you don‚Äôt want to use oil or natural gas, you have to pay for it. If you don‚Äôt want to manufacture semiconductors in China and you want to manufacture them in the US, you got to pay for it. If I rebuild the entire supply chain in Pennsylvania and I hire a bunch of employees and then I unionize the employees, then not only do I idle the factory in the Far East ‚Äî it goes to 50% capacity, so whatever it sells it has to raise the price on ‚Äî and then I drive up the cost of labor for every other manufacturer in the US because I‚Äôm competing against them. I‚Äôm changing their conditions. So everything gets less efficient, everything gets more expensive. and of course the government couldn‚Äôt really pay for its policies and its wars with taxes. We didn‚Äôt pay for World War I with tax, we didn‚Äôt pay for World War II with tax, we didn‚Äôt pay for Vietnam with tax. In fact, when you trace this, what you realize is: the government never pays for all of its policies with taxes. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs too painful to raise the taxes to truly transparently pay for the things you‚Äôre doing with taxpayer money. Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs one interpretation. or, it‚Äôs just too transparent. Like, if people understood the true cost Lex Fridman: Of war, they wouldn‚Äôt want to go to war. Michael Saylor: If you were told that you would lose 95% of your assets and 90% of everything, ever, will be taken from you, you might reprioritize your thought about a given policy and you might not vote for that politician. Lex Fridman: But you‚Äôre still saying incompetence, not malevolence. so fundamentally, government creates a bureaucracy of incompetence, is kind of how you look at it? Michael Saylor: I think a lack of humility, right? Like, if people had more humility then they would realize. Lex Fridman: Humility about how little they know, how little they understand about the function of complex systems. Michael Saylor: There‚Äôs the phrase from Clint Eastwood‚Äôs movie Unforgiven where he says, A man‚Äôs gotta know his limitations. I think that a lot of people overestimate what they can accomplish, and experience in life causes you to reevaluate that. So I mean, I‚Äôve done a lot of things in my life, and generally my mistakes were always my good ideas that I enthusiastically pursued to the detriment of my great ideas that required 150% of my attention to prosper. So I think people pursue too many good ideas. you know, they all sound good, but there‚Äôs just a limit to what you can accomplish, and everybody underestimates the challenges of implementing an idea, and they always overestimate the benefits of the pursuit of that. So I think it‚Äôs an overconfidence that causes an overexuberance in pursuit of policies. and as the ambition of the government expands, so must the currency supply. I could say the money supply, but let‚Äôs say the currency supply: you can triple the number of pesos in the economy but it doesn‚Äôt triple the amount of manufacturing capacity in the said economy, and it doesn‚Äôt triple the amount of assets in the economy. It just triples the pesos. So as you increase the currency supply, then the price of all those scarce desirable things will tend to go up rapidly, and the confidence of all of the institutions, the corporations, the individual actors, and trading partners will collapse. Lex Fridman: If we take a tangent on a tangent ‚Äî and we will return soon to the big human civilization question ‚Äî so if government naturally wants to buy stuff it can‚Äôt afford, what‚Äôs the best form of government? Anarchism? Libertarianism? So there‚Äôs not even armies, there‚Äôs no borders ‚Äî that‚Äôs anarchism. The smallest possible? Michael Saylor: The best government would be the least, and the debate will be over that. Lex Fridman: When you think about this stuff, do you think about, Okay, government is the way it is, I, as a person that can generate great ideas ‚Äî how do I operate in this world? Or do you also think about the big picture, if we start a new civilization somewhere on mars? Do you think about what‚Äôs the ultimate form of government? At least, what‚Äôs a promising thing to try. Michael Saylor: You know, I have laser eyes on my profile on Twitter. Lex Fridman: Yes, what does that mean? Michael Saylor: The significance of laser eyes is to focus on the thing that can make a difference. and if I look at the civilization, I would say half the problems in the civilization are due to the fact that our understanding of economics and money is defective ‚Äî half, 50%. I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs $500 trillion dollars worth of problems? Like, money represents all the economic energy in the civilization, and it kind of equates to all the products, all the services, and all the assets that we have and we‚Äôre ever gonna have ‚Äî so that‚Äôs half. The other half of the problems in the civilization are medical and military and political and philosophical and natural. And I think that there are a lot of different solutions to all those problems, and they are all honorable professions and they all merit a lifetime of consideration for the specialist in all those areas. I think that what I could offer that‚Äôs constructive is: inflation is completely misunderstood. It‚Äôs a much bigger problem than we understand it to be. We need to introduce engineering and science techniques into economics if we want to further the human condition. All government policy is inflationary. And another pernicious myth is: inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. So a famous quote by Milton Friedman I believe it‚Äôs like, It‚Äôs a monetary phenomenon. that is, inflation comes from expanding the currency supply. It‚Äôs a nice phrase and it‚Äôs oftentimes quoted by people that are anti-inflation, but again it just signifies a lack of appreciation of what the issue is. If I had a currency which was completely non-inflationary, if I never printed another dollar and if I eliminated fractional reserve banking from the face of the Earth, we‚Äôd still have inflation. We‚Äôd have inflation as long as we have government that is capable of pursuing any kind of policies that are in themselves inflationary, and generally they all are. Lex Fridman [timestamp 42:43]: So in general, the big characteristic of human nature is that governments ‚Äî a collection of groups that have power over others and allocate other people‚Äôs resources ‚Äî will try to, intentionally or not, hide the costs of those allocations. Like, in some tricky ways ‚Äî whatever options are available. Michael Saylor: Hiding the cost is like the tertiary thing. The primary goal is: the government will attempt to do good, right? Lex Fridman: And that‚Äôs the primary problem? Michael Saylor: They will attempt to do good and they will and they will do good imperfectly and they will create oftentimes more damage than the good they do. Most government policy will be iatrogenic: it will create more harm than good in the pursuit of it ‚Äî but it is what it is. The secondary issue is they will unintentionally pay for it by expanding the currency supply without realizing that they‚Äôre actually paying for it in a sub-optimal fashion: they‚Äôll collapse their own currencies while they attempt to do good. The tertiary issue is: they will mismeasure how badly they‚Äôre collapsing the currency. so for example, if you go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and look at the numbers printed by the Fed, they‚Äôll say, Oh it looks like the dollar has lost 95% of its purchasing power over 100 years. Okay, they sort of fess up that there‚Äôs a problem, but they make it a 95% loss over 100 years ‚Äî what they don‚Äôt do is realize it‚Äôs a 99.7% loss over 80 years, so they will mismeasure just the horrific extent of the monetary policy in pursuit of the foreign policy and the domestic policy, which they overestimate their budget and their means to accomplish their ends and they underestimate the cost and they‚Äôre oblivious to the horrific damage that they do to the civilization, because the mental models that they use ‚Äî that are conventionally taught ‚Äî are wrong. The mental model that like, It‚Äôs okay, we can print all this money because the velocity of the money is low, right? ‚Äî because money velocity is a scalar and inflation is a scalar and we don‚Äôt see 2% inflation yet and the money velocity is low and so it‚Äôs okay if we print trillions of dollars. Well, the money velocity was immediate. The velocity of money through the crypto economy is 10,000 times faster than the velocity of money through the consumer economy. I think Nic [Carter] pointed out when you spoke to him, he said it takes two months for a credit card transaction to settle. So you want to spend a million dollars in the consumer economy, you can move it six times a year. You put a million dollars into gold? Gold will sit in a vault for a decade, so the velocity of money through gold is 0.1. You put the money in the stock market and you can trade it once a week, the settlement is T+2. maybe you get the 2:1 leverage, you might get to a money velocity of 100 a year in the stock market. You put your money into the crypto economy and these people are settling every four hours, and if you‚Äôre offshore they‚Äôre trading with 20x leverage. So if you settle every day and you trade the 20x leverage you just went to 7,000! So the velocity of the money varies. I think the politicians, they don‚Äôt really understand inflation and they don‚Äôt understand economics, but you can‚Äôt blame them because the economists don‚Äôt understand economics. Because if they did, they would be creating multi-variate computer simulations where they actually put in the price of every piece of housing in every city in the world, the full array of foods, the full array of products, the full array of assets, and then on a monthly basis they would publish all those results. That‚Äôs a high bandwidth requirement and I think that people don‚Äôt really want to embrace it. And also there‚Äôs the most pernicious thing ‚Äî there‚Äôs that phrase, You can‚Äôt tell people what to think but you can tell them what to think about ‚Äî the most pernicious thing is: I get you to misunderstand the phenomenon so that even when it‚Äôs happening to you, you don‚Äôt appreciate that it‚Äôs a bad thing and you think it‚Äôs a good thing. So if housing prices are going up 20% year-over-year and I say, This is great for the American public because most of them are homeowners, then I‚Äôve misrepresented a phenomenon. Inflation is 20%, not 7%, and then I‚Äôve misrepresented it as being a positive rather than a negative. And the people will stare at it and you could even show them their house on fire and they would perceive it as being great because it‚Äôs warming them up and they‚Äôre going to save on their heat costs. Lex Fridman [timestamp 48:24]: It does seem that the cruder the model ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs economics, whether it‚Äôs psychology ‚Äî the easier it is to weave whatever the heck narrative you want. And not in a malicious way, but just like it‚Äôs some kind of emergent phenomena, this narrative thing that we tell ourselves. So you can tell any kind of story about inflation ‚Äî inflation is good, inflation is bad ‚Äî the cruder the model, the easier it is to tell a narrative about it. So like if you take an engineering approach, I feel like it becomes more and more difficult to run away from a true, deep understanding of the dynamics of the system. Michael Saylor: I mean honestly, if you went to 100 people on the street and you asked them to define inflation, how many would say it‚Äôs a vector tracking the change in price of every product, service, asset in the world over time? Not many. If you went to them and you said, Do you think 2% inflation a year is good or bad? The majority would probably say, Well here, it‚Äôs good. The majority of economists would say, 2% inflation a year is good. Look at the ship next to us: what if I told you that the ship leaked 2% of its volume every something, right? The ship is rotting 2% a year ‚Äî that means the useful life of the ship is 50 years. Now ironically, that‚Äôs true: a wooden ship had a 50‚Äì100 year life. 100 would be long, 50 years is not unlikely. So when we built ships out of wood, they had a useful life of about 50 years and then they sunk and they rotted. There‚Äôs nothing good about it, right? You build a ship out of steel and it‚Äôs 0% as opposed to 2% degradation, and how much better is 0% versus 2%? well 2% means you have a useful half-life of 35 years. That‚Äôs basically the half-life of money in gold. If I store your life force in gold ‚Äî under perfect circumstances ‚Äî you have a useful life at 35 years. 0% is a useful life of forever. so 0% is immortal, 2% is 35 years average life expectancy. So the idea that you would think the life expectancy of the currency in the civilization should be 35 years instead of forever is kind of a silly notion, but the tragic notion is since the 1970‚Äôs it‚Äôs been 10 years. Money has had a half-life of 10 years, except for the fact that in weak societies ‚Äî in Argentina or the like ‚Äî the half-life of the money is 3‚Äì4 years, in Venezuela 1 year. So the United States dollar and the United States economic system was the most successful economic system in the world in the last hundred years: we won every war, we were the world superpower. Our currency lost 99.7% of its value. And that means ‚Äî horrifically ‚Äî every other currency lost everything. In essence, the other ones were 99.9% except for most that were 100% because they all completely failed, and you‚Äôve got a you‚Äôve got a mainstream economic community that thinks that inflation is a number and 2% is desirable. It‚Äôs kind of like: remember George Washington, you know how he died? Lex Fridman: No Michael Saylor [timestamp 52:19]: Well-meaning physicians bled him to death. the last thing in the world you would want to do to a sick person is bleed them in the modern world. I think we understand that oxygen is carried by the blood cells. There‚Äôs that triage phrase: what‚Äôs the first thing you do in an injury? Stop the bleeding. Single first thing, right? You show up after any action, I look at you ‚Äî stop the bleeding, because you‚Äôre going to be dead in a matter of minutes if you bleed out. So it strikes me as being ironic that orthodox conventional wisdom was: bleed the patient to death. and this was the most important patient in the country ‚Äî maybe in the history of the country and it‚Äôs and we bled him to death trying to help him. so when you‚Äôre actually inflating the money supply at 7% but you‚Äôre calling it 2% because you want to help the economy, you‚Äôre literally bleeding the free market to death. But the sad fact is George Washington went along with it because he thought that they were going to do him good. And the majority of the society ‚Äî most companies most conventional thinkers ‚Äî the working class, they go along with this because they think that someone has their best interest in mind, and the people that are bleeding them to death believe that prescription because their mental models are just so defective, and their understanding of energy and engineering and the economics that are at play is crippled by these mental models. Lex Fridman: But that‚Äôs both the bug and the feature of human civilization, that ideas take hold, they unite us, we believe in them, and we make a lot of cool stuff happen ‚Äî just the fact of the matter: a lot of people believe the same thing, they get together, and they get some shit done because they believe that thing. And then some ideas can be really bad and really destructive, but on average the ideas seem to be progressing in a direction of good. Let me just step back: what the hell are we doing here ‚Äî us humans on this Earth? How do you think of humans? How special are humans? How did human civilization originate on this Earth? And what is this human project that we‚Äôre all taking on? You mentioned fire and water and apparently bleeding you to death is not a good idea ‚Äî always thought you can get the demons out in that way, but that was a recent invention. So what‚Äôs this thing we‚Äôre doing here? Michael Saylor: I think what distinguishes human beings from all the other creatures on the Earth is our ability to engineer. We‚Äôre engineers, right? Lex Fridman: To solve problems? Or just to build incredible cool things? Michael Saylor: Engineering: harnessing energy and technique to make the world a better place than you found it. From the point that we actually started to play with fire, that was a big leap forward. Harnessing the power of kinetic energy and missiles, another another step forward. Every city built on water ‚Äî why water? Well, water‚Äôs bringing energy. If you actually put a turbine on a river or you capture a change in elevation of water, you‚Äôve literally harnessed gravitational energy. But water is also bringing you food, it‚Äôs also giving you a cheap form of getting rid of your waste, it‚Äôs also giving you free transportation ‚Äî you want to move 1-ton blocks around? You want to move them in water. So the human story is really the story of engineering a better world. And the rise in the human condition is determined by those groups of people, those civilizations that were best at harnessing energy. If you look, the Greek civilization, they built it around ports and seaports and water and created a trading network. The Romans were really good at harnessing all sorts of engineering ‚Äî the aqueducts are a great example. If you go to any big city, you travel through cities in the Med, you find that the carrying capacity of the city or the island is 5,000 people without running water, and then if you can find a way to bring water to it, it increases by a factor of 10. And so human flourishing is really only possible through that channeling of energy. That eventually takes the form of air power. that ship ‚Äî look at the intricacy of those sails. I mean just the model is intricate ‚Äî now think about all of the experimentation that took place to figure out how many sails to put on that ship and how to rig them and how to repair them and how to operate them. Lex Fridman: Yes, there‚Äôs thousands of lives spent thinking through all the tiny little details, all to increase the effectiveness the efficiency of this ship as it sails through water. And we should also note there‚Äôs a bunch of cannons on the side. Michael Saylor: Another form of engineering, right? Energy harnessing with explosives. Lex Fridman: To achieve what end? That‚Äôs another discussion. Michael Saylor: I suppose we‚Äôre trying to get off the planet, right? Lex Fridman: Well there‚Äôs a selection mechanism going on, so natural selection. However evolution works, it seems that one of the interesting inventions on Earth was the predator-prey dynamic, that you want to be the bigger fish. that violence seems to serve a useful purpose if you look at Earth as a whole. Humans now like to think of violence as really a bad thing. It seems to be one of the amazing things about humans is we ultimately tend towards cooperation: we like peace. If you just look at history, we want things to be nice and calm, but just wars break out every once in a while and lead to immense suffering and destruction and so on. And they have a resetting the palate effect. It‚Äôs one that‚Äôs full of just immeasurable human suffering, but it‚Äôs like a way to start over. Michael Saylor [timestamp 59:32]: We‚Äôre clearly the apex predator on the planet. I googled something the other day: what‚Äôs the most common form of mammal life on Earth? Lex Fridman: By number of organisms? Michael Saylor: By count. And the answer that came back was human beings! I was shocked ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt believe it. Apparently if we‚Äôre just looking at mammals, the answer was: human beings are the most common, which was very interesting to me. I almost didn‚Äôt believe it, but I was trying to think: 8 billion or so human beings ‚Äî there‚Äôs no other mammal that‚Äôs got more than 8 billion? If you walk through downtown Edinburgh in Scotland and you look up on this hill, there‚Äôs this castle up on the hill and you talk to people and the story is, Oh yeah well that was a British castle, before it was a Scottish castle, before it was Pict castle, before it was a Roman castle, before it was some other Celtic castle. Then they found 13 prehistoric castles buried one under the other, under the other, and you get to the conclusion that 100,000 years ago somebody showed up and grabbed the high-point ‚Äî the apex of the city ‚Äî and they built a stronghold there and they flourished and their family flourished and their tribe flourished until someone came along and knocked him off the hill. And it‚Äôs been a non-stop, never-ending fight by the aggressive, most powerful entity, family, organization, municipality, tribe, whatever ‚Äî Lex Fridman: All for the hill. Michael Saylor: For that one hill, going back since time immemorial, and you scratch your head and you think, It seems like it‚Äôs just this never-ending wheel. Lex Fridman: But doesn‚Äôt that leave all kinds of metrics? That seems to improve the quality of our cannons and ships as a result. Like, it seems that war ‚Äî just like your laser eyes ‚Äî focuses the mind on the engineering tasks. Michael Saylor: It is that, and it does remind you that the winner is always the most powerful. And we throw that phrase out, but no one thinks about what that phrase means. Like, Who‚Äôs the most powerful? Or, The most powerful side won, but they don‚Äôt think about power as energy delivered in a period of time, and then you think, A guy with a spear is more powerful than someone with their fist, and someone with a bow and arrow is more powerful than the person with the spear, and then you realize that somebody with bronze is more powerful than without, and steel is more powerful than bronze. And if you look at the Romans, they persevered with artillery and they could stand off from 800 meters and blast you to smithereens. You study the history of the Balearic slingers and you think we invented bullets, but they invented bullets to put in slings thousands of years ago. They could have stood off 500 meters and put a hole in your head, right? And so there was never a time when when humanity wasn‚Äôt vying to come up with an asymmetric form of projecting their own power via technology. Lex Fridman: An absolute power is when a leader is able to control a large amount of humans. They‚Äôre facing the same direction ‚Äî working in the same direction to leverage energy. Michael Saylor: The most organized society wins. When the Romans were were dominating everybody, they were the most organized civilization in Europe. And as long as they stayed organized, they dominated. And at some point they over-expanded and got disorganized and they collapsed. And I guess you could say that the struggle of the human condition, it catalyzes the development of new technologies one after the other, it penalizes ‚Äî anybody that rejects ocean power gets penalized. You reject artillery, you get penalized. You reject atomic power, you get penalized. If you reject digital power, cyber power, you get penalized, and the underlying control of the property keeps shifting hands from one institution or one government to another, based upon how rationally they‚Äôre able to channel that energy and how well organized or coordinated they are. Lex Fridman: Well that‚Äôs really interesting thing about both the human mind and governments and companies ‚Äî once they get a few good ideas they seem to stick with them. They reject new ideas. Whether that‚Äôs emergent or however that evolved, it seems to have a really interesting effect because when you‚Äôre young you fight for the new ideas, you push them through, then a few of us humans find success, then we get complacent, we take over the world using that new idea, and then the new young person with the better new idea challenges you and you, as opposed to pivoting, you stick with the old and lose because of it. And that‚Äôs how empires collapse. And it‚Äôs just both at the individual level that happens, when two academics fighting about ideas or something like that, and at the human civilization-level ‚Äî governments, they hold on to the ideas of old. it‚Äôs fascinating. Michael Saylor: Yeah an ever-persistent theme in the history of science is the paradigm shift, and the paradigms shift when the old guard dies and a new generation arrives. Or, the paradigm shifts when there‚Äôs a war and everyone that disagrees with the idea of aviation finds bombs dropping on their head. Or everyone that disagrees with whatever your technology is has a rude awakening. And if they totally disagree, their society collapses and they‚Äôre replaced by that new thing. Lex Fridman [timestamp 1:05:59]: A lot of the engineering you talked about had to do with ships and cannons and leveraging water. What about this whole digital thing that‚Äôs been happening over the past century? Is that still engineering in your mind? You‚Äôre starting to operate in these bits of information. Michael Saylor: I think there‚Äôs two big ideas: the first wave of ideas were digital information, and that was the Internet wave that‚Äôs been running since 1990 or so, for 30 years. And the second wave is digital energy. So if I look at digital information, this idea that we want to digitally transform a book, I‚Äôm going to dematerialize every book in this room into bits and then I‚Äôm going to deliver a copy of the entire library to a billion people and I‚Äôm going to do it for pretty much de minimis electricity ‚Äî if I can dematerialize music, books, education, entertainment, maps, that is an incredibly exothermic transaction. it‚Äôs a crystallization. When we collapse into a lower energy state as a civilization we give off massive amounts of energy. Like, if you look at what Carnegie did: the richest man in the world created libraries everywhere at the time and he gave away his entire fortune. And now we can give a better library to every six year old for nothing. And so what‚Äôs the value of giving a million books to 8 billion people? That‚Äôs the explosion in prosperity that comes from digital transformation. And when we do it with maps, I transform the map, I put it into a car, you get in the car, and the car drives you where you want to go with the map. And how much better is that than a Rand McNally atlas right here? It‚Äôs like a million times better. So the first wave of digital transformation was the dematerialization of all of these informational things which are non-conservative ‚Äî that is, I could take Beethoven‚Äôs 5th symphony played by the best orchestra in Germany and I could give it to a billion people and they could play it a thousand times each at less than the cost of the one performance. So I deliver culture and education and erudition and intelligence and insight to the entire civilization over digital rails, and the consequences to the human race are, first order, generally good, right? The world is a better place, it drives growth, and you create these trillion-dollar entities like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft. That is the first wave. Lex Fridman: That first wave, it feels like the impact that‚Äôs positive ‚Äî you said the first order impact is generally positive ‚Äî it feels like it‚Äôs positive in a way that nothing else in history has been positive. And then we may not actually truly be able to understand the orders of magnitude of increase in productivity, in just progress of human civilization, until we look back centuries from now. Like just looking at the impact of Wikipedia, giving access to basic knowledge and then perhaps wisdom to billions of people ‚Äî if you can just linger on that for a second: what‚Äôs your sense of the impact of that? Michael Saylor [timestamp 1:09:55]: I would say: if you‚Äôre a technologist-philosopher, the impact of a technology is so much greater on the civilization and the human condition than a non-technology that it‚Äôs almost not worth your trouble to bother trying to fix things in a conventional way. So let‚Äôs take example an: I have a foundation, the Saylor Academy, and the Saylor Academy gives away free education, free college education, to anybody on Earth that wants it. And we‚Äôve had more than a million students. And if you go and you take the physics class, the lectures were by the same physics lecturer that taught me physics at MIT, except when I was at MIT the cost of the first four weeks of MIT would have drained my family‚Äôs collective life savings for the last hundred years. Like, a hundred years worth ‚Äî my father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather ‚Äî if they saved every penny they had after 100 years they could have paid for one week or two weeks at MIT. That‚Äôs how fiendishly expensive and inefficient it was. I went on scholarship ‚Äî I was lucky to have a scholarship. But on the other hand, I sat in the back of the 801 lecture hall and I was like right up in the rafters ‚Äî it‚Äôs an awful experience on these uncomfortable wooden benches and you can barely see the blackboard, and you‚Äôve got to be there synchronously. And the stuff we upload, you can start it and stop it and watch it on your iPad or watch it on your computer and rewind it multiple times and sit in a comfortable chair and you can do it from anywhere on Earth and it‚Äôs absolutely free. So I think about this and I think: you want to improve the human condition? You need people with post-graduate level education, you need PhDs, and I know this sounds kind of elitist, but you want to cure cancer? You want to go to the stars? Fusion drive? We need new propulsion, right? We need we need extraordinary breakthroughs in every area of basic science, be it biology or propulsion or material science or computer science. You‚Äôre not doing that with an undergraduate degree. You‚Äôre certainly not doing it with a high school education. But the cost of a PhD is like a million bucks. There‚Äôs like 10 million PhDs in the world if you check it out. There‚Äôs 8 billion people in the world. How many people could get a PhD or would want to? Maybe not 8 billion, but a billion? 500 million? Let‚Äôs just say 500 million to a billion: how do you go from 10 million to a billion highly educated people, all of them specializing in ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt have to tell you how many different fields of human endeavor there are ‚Äî I mean, your life is interviewing these experts and there‚Äôs so many it‚Äôs amazing. So how do I give a multi-million dollar education to a billion people? And there‚Äôs two choices: you can either endow a scholarship in which case you pay $75,000 a year. Let‚Äôs pay a million dollars a person ‚Äî I can do it that way. And even if you had a trillion dollars ‚Äî if you had $10 trillion dollars to throw at the problem ‚Äî and we‚Äôve just thrown $10 trillion dollars at certain problems ‚Äî you don‚Äôt solve the problem, right? If I put $10 trillion dollars on the table and I said, Educate everybody, give them all a PhD ‚Äî you still wouldn‚Äôt solve the problem. Harvard University can‚Äôt educate 18,000 people simultaneously or 87,000 or 800,000 or 8 million, so you have to dematerialize the professor and dematerialize the experience. So you put it all as streaming on-demand computer-generated education, and you create simulations where you need to create simulations and you upload it. The human condition is being held back by 500,000 well-meaning, average algebra teachers. I love them I mean please don‚Äôt take offense if you‚Äôre an algebra teacher. But instead of 500,000 algebra teachers going through the same motion over and over again, what you need is 1 or 5 or 10 really good algebra teachers and they need to do it a billion times a day or billion times a year for free. And if we do that there‚Äôs no reason why you can‚Äôt give infinite education, certainly in science, technology, engineering, and math, right? Infinite education to everybody with no constraint. And I think the same is true with just about every other thing: if you want to bring joy to the world you need digital music, if you want to bring enlightenment to the world you need digital education, if want to bring anything of consequence in the world you got to digitally transform it and then you got to manufacture it something like a hundred times more efficiently as a start, but a million times more efficiently is probably ‚Äî that‚Äôs hopeful, maybe you have a chance. And if you look at all of these space endeavors and everything with, We‚Äôre thinking about getting to Mars, getting off the planet, getting to other worlds, number one thing you gotta do is you‚Äôve gotta make a fundamental breakthrough in an engine. People dreamed about flying for thousands of years, but until the internal combustion engine, you didn‚Äôt have enough energy ‚Äî enough power in a light enough package ‚Äî in order to solve the problem. And the human race has all sorts of those fundamental engines and materials and techniques that we need to master, and each one of them is a lifetime of experimentation of someone capable of making a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. Lex Fridman: There are certain problems like education that could be solved through this process of dematerialization. And by the way, to give props to the 500,000 algebra teachers ‚Äî when I look at YouTube, for example, one possible approach is each one of those 500,000 teachers probably had days and moments of brilliance, and if they had ability to contribute to ‚Äî in the natural selection process ‚Äî like the market of education where the best ones rise up. That‚Äôs a really interesting way, which is like: the best day of your life, the best lesson you‚Äôve ever taught, could be found and broadcast to billions of people. So all of those kinds of ideas can be made real in the digital world. Now traveling across planets, you still can‚Äôt solve that problem with dematerialization. What you could solve, potentially, is dematerializing the human brain, where you can transfer ‚Äî like you don‚Äôt need to have astronauts on the ship you ‚Äî can have a floppy disk carrying a human brain. Michael Saylor: Touching on those points: you‚Äôd love for the 500,000 algebra teachers to become 500,000 math specialists and maybe they clump into 50,000 specialties as teams and they all pursue 50,000 new problems and they put their algebra teaching on autopilot. That‚Äôs the same as when I give you 11 cents worth of electricity and you don‚Äôt have to row a boat eight hours a day before you can eat. It would be a lot better that you would pay for your food in the first eight seconds of your day and then you could start thinking about other things, right? With regard to technology, one thing that I learned studying technology ‚Äî when you look at S-curves ‚Äî is: until you start the S-curve, you don‚Äôt know whether you‚Äôre 100 years from viability, 1,000 years from viability, or a few months from viability. Lex Fridman: Isn‚Äôt that fun? That‚Äôs so fun ‚Äî the early part of the S-curve is so fun because you don‚Äôt know. Michael Saylor: In 1900 you could have got any number of learned academics to give you 10,000 reasons why humans will never fly. And in 1903 the Wright Brothers flew, and by 1969 we‚Äôre walking on the moon. So the advance that we made in that field was extraordinary, but for the 100 years and 200 years before they were just back and forth and nobody was close. And that‚Äôs the happy part. The happy part is we went from flying 20 miles an hour or whatever to 25,000 flying miles an hour in 66 years. The unhappy part is I studied aeronautical engineering at MIT in the 80's and in the 80's we had Gulfstream aircraft, we had Boeing 737s, we had the space shuttle, and you fast forward 40 years and we pretty much had the same exact aircraft ‚Äî the efficiency of the engines was 20%-30% more. We slammed into a brick wall around ‚Äò69-‚Äô75. In fact the Global Express, the Gulfstream ‚Äî these were all engineered in the 70's, some in the 60's. The actual fuselage silhouette of a Gulfstream of a G5 is the same shape as a G4 is the same shape as a G3 is the same shape as a G2, and that‚Äôs because they were afraid to change the shape for 40 years because they worked it out in a wind tunnel and they knew it worked, and when they finally decided to change the shape it was like a $10 billion dollar exercise with modern supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics. Lex Fridman: Why was it so hard? What was that wall made of that they slammed into? Michael Saylor: But the right question is: so why does a guy that went to MIT that got an aeronautical engineering degree spend his career in software? Like, why is it that I never a day in my life ‚Äî with the exception of some Air Force Reserve work ‚Äî I never got paid to be an aeronautical engineer and I worked in software engineering my entire career. Lex Fridman: Maybe software engineering is the new aeronautical engineering in some way. Like maybe you hit fundamental walls until you have to return to it centuries later? Or no? Michael Saylor: The National Gallery of Art was endowed by a very rich man, Andrew Mellon, and you know how he made his money? Aluminum. And you know what kind of airplanes you can create without aluminum? Nothing. Lex Fridman: So it‚Äôs a materials problem? Michael Saylor: Okay, so 1900, we made massive advances in metallurgy. I mean that was US Steel, that was iron to steel, aluminum ‚Äî massive fortunes were created because this was a massive technical advance. And then we also had the internal combustion engine and the story of Ford and General Motors and Daimler Chrysler and the like is informed by that. So you have no jet engines, no rocket motors, no internal combustion engines, you have no aviation, but even if you had those engines, if you were trying to build those things with steel ‚Äî no chance ‚Äî you had to have aluminum. So there‚Äôs like two pretty basic technologies, and once you have those two technologies, stuff happens very fast. So tell me the last big advance in jet engines? There hasn‚Äôt been one. The last big advance in rocket engines? There hasn‚Äôt been one. The big advances in spaceship design, from what I can see, are in the control systems, the gyros, and the ability to land in a stable fashion ‚Äî that‚Äôs pretty amazing landing a rocket. Lex Fridman: Also, at least according to Elon and so on, the manufacturer ‚Äî the more efficient and less expensive manufacturer of rockets. So like production ‚Äî whatever that you call that discipline of at-scale manufacture or at-scale production, so factory work. But it‚Äôs not 10x. I mean, maybe it‚Äôs 10x over a period of a few decades. Michael Saylor [timestamp 1:23:19]: When we figure out how to operate a spaceship on the water in your water bottle for a year ‚Äî now then you‚Äôve got a breakthrough. So the bottom line is: propulsion technology, propellants, and the materials technology, they were critical to getting on that aviation S-curve. And then we slammed into a wall in the 70's, and the Boeing 747, the Global Express, the Gulfstream, the space shuttle, they were all pretty much reflective of that. And then then we stopped ‚Äî and at that point you have to switch to a new S-curve. So the next equivalent to the internal combustion engine was the CPU, and the next aluminum-equivalent was silicon. So when we actually started developing CPUs ‚Äî the transistor gave way to CPUs ‚Äî and if you look at the power, the bandwidth that we had on computers, and Moore‚Äôs law ‚Äî what if the efficiency of jet engines had doubled every three years in the last 40 years? Where we be right now? So I think that if you‚Äôre a businessperson, if you‚Äôre looking for commercially viable application of your mind, then you have to find that S-curve. And ideally you have to find it in the first 5, 6, 10 years, but people always miss this. Let‚Äôs take Google Glass: Google Glass was an idea in 2013 ‚Äî the year is 2022, and people were quite sure this was going to be a big thing. Lex Fridman: But it could have been ‚Äî at the beginning of the S-curve. Michael Saylor: But fundamentally, we didn‚Äôt really have an effective mechanism ‚Äî I mean, people getting vertigo and they‚Äôre ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Yeah, but you didn‚Äôt know that at the beginning of the S-curve, right? I mean maybe some people had a deep intuition about the fundamentals of augmented reality, but you don‚Äôt know that. You‚Äôre looking through the fog ‚Äî you don‚Äôt know. Michael Saylor: So the point is: we‚Äôre year zero in 2013 and we‚Äôre still year zero in 2022 on that augmented reality, and when somebody puts out a set of glasses that you can wear comfortably without getting vertigo, without any disorientation, that managed to have the stability and the bandwidth necessary to sync with the real world ‚Äî you‚Äôll be in year one. And from that point, you‚Äôll have a 70-year or some interesting future until you slam into a limit to growth, and then it‚Äôll slow down. And this is the story of a lot of things. I mean, John D. Rockefeller got in the oil business in the 1860's and the oil business as we understood it became fairly mature by the 1920's to 1930's, and then it actually stayed that way until we got to fracking, which was like 70 years later and then it burst forward. Lex Fridman: The interesting story about Moore‚Äôs law, though, is that you get this constant burst of S-curves on top of S-curves on top of S-curves ‚Äî it‚Äôs like, the moment you start slowing down, or almost ahead of you slowing down, you come up with another innovation, another innovation. It‚Äôs like, Moore‚Äôs law doesn‚Äôt seem to happen in every technological advancement. It seems like you only get a couple of S-curves and then you‚Äôre done for a bit, so I wonder what pressures there are that resulted in such success over several decades, and still going. Michael Saylor: Humility dictates that nobody knows when the S-curve kicks off, and you could be 20 years early or 100 years early. Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, they were designing flying machines hundreds and hundreds of years ago. So humility says you‚Äôre not quite sure when you really hit that commercial viability, and it also dictates: you don‚Äôt know when it ends. Like, when will the party stop? When will Moore‚Äôs law stop, and we‚Äôll get to the point where they are exponentially diminishing returns on silicon performance? Just like we got exponentially diminishing returns on jet engines, and it just takes an exponential increase in effort to make it 10% percent better. But while you‚Äôre in the middle of it, then you know you can do things. So the reason that the digital revolution is so important is because the underlying platforms ‚Äî the bandwidth of and the performance of the components, and the components are the radio protocols, mobile protocols, the batteries, the CPUs, and the displays ‚Äî those four components are pretty critical. They‚Äôre all critical in the creation of an iPhone ‚Äî I wrote about it in the book, The Mobile Wave, and they catalyzed this entire mobile revolution. Because they have advanced and continued to advance, they created a very fertile environment for all these digital transformations. And the digital transformations themself, they call for creativity on their own. Like, I think the interesting thing about ‚Äî let‚Äôs take digital maps ‚Äî when you conceptualize something as a dematerialized map, it becomes a map because I can put it on a display like an iPad or I can put it in a car like a Tesla, but if you really want to figure it out, you can‚Äôt think like an engineer. You need to think like a fantasy writer. Like, this is where it‚Äôs useful if you played Dungeons & Dragons and you read Lord of the Rings and you study all the fantasy literature, because when I dematerialize the map, first I put 10 million pages of satellite imagery into the map ‚Äî that‚Äôs a simple physical transform. But then I start to put telemetry into the map and I keep track of the traffic rates on the roads and I tell you whether you‚Äôll be in a traffic jam if you drive that way and I tell you which way to drive, and then I start to get feedback on where you‚Äôre going and I tell you the restaurant‚Äôs closed and people don‚Äôt like it anyway, and then I put an AI on top of it and I have it drive your car for you. And eventually, the implication of digital transformation of maps is: I get in a self-driving car and I say, Take me someplace cool where I can eat? [goes to sleep]. And how did you get to that last step? It wasn‚Äôt simple engineering. There‚Äôs a bit of fantasy in there. A bit of magic. Lex Fridman: Design, art, whatever the heck you call it. Yeah, fantasy injects magic into the engineering process. Like, imagination precedes great revolutions in engineering. It‚Äôs like imagining a world of what you can do with the display, how will the interaction be. That‚Äôs where Google Glass actually came in: augmented reality, virtual reality ‚Äî people are playing in the space of sci-fi imagination. Michael Saylor: They called it a moon shot. They tried ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt work, but to their credit they stopped trying. Lex Fridman [timestamp 1:31:04]: And then there‚Äôs new people. They keep dreaming ‚Äî dreamers are all around us. I love those dreamers. And most of them fail and suffer because of it, but some of them win Nobel prizes or become billionaires. Michael Saylor: But what I would say is: if half the civilization dropped what they were doing tomorrow and eagerly started working on launching a rocket to Alpha Centauri ‚Äî it might not be the best use of our resources, because it‚Äôs kind of like if half of Athens in the year 500 BC eagerly started working on flying machines. If you went back and you said, What advice would you give them? Lex Fridman: Don‚Äôt! Michael Saylor: You would say, It‚Äôs not going to work until you get to aluminum, and you‚Äôre not going to get to aluminum untill you work out the steel and certain other things, and you‚Äôre not going to get to that until you work out the calculus of variations and some metallurgy ‚Äî and there‚Äôs a dude, Newton, that won‚Äôt come along for quite a while and he‚Äôs going to give you the calculus to do it and until then it‚Äôs hopeless. So you might be better off to work on the aqueduct or to focus upon sails or something. So if I look at this today I would say: There‚Äôs massive profound civilizational advances to be made through digital transformation of information ‚Äî and you can see them. This is not the story of today, right? It‚Äôs 10 years old, what we‚Äôve been seeing. Lex Fridman: We‚Äôre living through different manifestations of that story today too, though. Like, social media, the effects of that is very interesting, because ideas spread even ‚Äî you talk about velocity of money ‚Äî the velocity of ideas keeps increasing. So like Wikipedia is a passive store of knowledge. Twitter is like a water hose or something ‚Äî it‚Äôs like spraying you with knowledge whether you want it or not. Social media is just like this explosion of ideas and then we pick them up and then we try to understand ourselves because the drama of it also plays with our human psyche, so sometimes there‚Äôs more ability for misinformation, for propaganda to take hold, so we get to learn about ourselves, we get to learn about the technology that can decelerate the propaganda, for example ‚Äî all that kind of stuff. But the reality is I feel like we‚Äôre living through a singularity in the digital information space, and we don‚Äôt have a great understanding of exactly how it‚Äôs transforming our lives. Michael Saylor: This is where money is useful as a metaphor for significance, because if money is the economic energy of the civilization, then something that‚Äôs extraordinarily lucrative that‚Äôs going to generate a monetary or a wealth increase is a way to increase the net energy in the civilization. And ultimately, if we had 10x as much of everything we‚Äôd have a lot more free resources to pursue all of our advanced scientific and mathematical and theoretical endeavors. So let‚Äôs take Twitter, right? Twitter‚Äôs something that could be 10x more valuable than it is. Twitter could be made 10x better. Lex Fridman: Oh by the way, I should say that people should follow you on Twitter. Your Twitter account is awesome. Michael Saylor: Thank you. Yeah Twitter can be made 10x better. If we take YouTube or take education, we could generate a billion PhDs. And the question is: do you need any profound breakthrough in materials or technology to do that? And the answer is: Not really. So you could make Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter ‚Äî all these things ‚Äî better. The US Government, if they took 1% of the money they spend on the department of education and they simply poured it into digital education and they gave degrees to people that actually met those requirements, they could provide 100x as much education for 1/100th of the cost and they could do it with no new technology ‚Äî that‚Äôs a marketing and political challenge. So I don‚Äôt think every objective is equally practical, and I think the benefit of being an engineer or thinking about practical achievements, is: when the government pursues an impractical objective, or when anybody ‚Äî not so bad with an entrepreneur because they don‚Äôt have that much money to waste ‚Äî when a government pursues an impractical objective, they squander trillions and trillions of dollars and achieve nothing. Whereas if they pursue a practical objective or if they simply get out of the way and do nothing and they allow the free market to pursue the practical objectives, then I think you can have profound impact on the human civilization. And if I look at the world we‚Äôre in today, I think that there are multi-trillion ‚Äî $10, $20, $50 trillion dollars ‚Äî worth of opportunities in the digital information realm yet to be obtained, but there‚Äôs hundreds of trillions of dollars of opportunities in the digital energy realm that, not only are they not obtained, the majority of people don‚Äôt even know what digital energy is. Most of them would reject the concept. They‚Äôre not looking for it. They‚Äôre not expecting to find it. It‚Äôs inconceivable because it is a paradigm shift, but in fact it‚Äôs completely practical, right under our nose, it‚Äôs staring at us, and it could make the entire civilization work dramatically better in every respect. Lex Fridman [timestamp 1:37:19]: So you mentioned in the digital world, digital information is one, digital energy is two, and the possible impact on the world and the set of opportunities available in the digital energy space is much greater. So how do you think about digital energy? What is it? Michael Saylor: So I‚Äôll start with Tesla: he had a very famous quote. He said, If you want to understand the universe, think in terms of energy, vibration, and frequency. And it gets you thinking about, What is the universe? And of course the universe is just all energy. And then what is matter? Matter is low frequency energy. And what are we? We‚Äôre vibrating from ‚Äî ashes to ashes dust to dust ‚Äî I can turn a tree into light, I can turn light back into a tree. If I consider the entire universe ‚Äî and it‚Äôs very important because we don‚Äôt really think this way ‚Äî let‚Äôs take the New York disco model: if I walk into a nightclub and there‚Äôs loud music blaring in New York City, what‚Äôs really going on there? If you blast out 14 billion years ago, the universe is formed ‚Äî okay, that‚Äôs a low frequency thing ‚Äî the universe. Four and a half billion years ago, the Sun, maybe the Earth, are formed. The continents are 400 million years old. The schist that New York City is on is some hundreds of millions of years, but the Hudson River is only 20,000 years. There‚Äôs a building that‚Äôs probably 50 years old. There‚Äôs a company operating that disco or that club which is 5‚Äì10 years old. There‚Äôs a person, a customer, walking in there for an experience for a few hours. There‚Äôs music that‚Äôs oscillating at some kilohertz. And then there‚Äôs light. And you and you have all forms of energy, all frequencies, all layered, all moving through different mediums, and how you perceive the world is a question of: At what frequency do you want to perceive the world? And I think that once you start to think that way, you‚Äôre catalyzed to think about what would digital energy look like? And why would I want it? And what is it? So why don‚Äôt we just start right there: What is it? The most famous manifestation of digital energy is Bitcoin. Bitcoin‚Äôs a crypto-asset. It‚Äôs a crypto-asset that has monetary value. Lex Fridman: Can we just linger on that? Bitcoin is a digital asset that has monetary value. What is a digital asset? What is monetary? Why use those terms versus the words of money and currency? Is there something interesting in that disambiguation of different terms? Michael Saylor: I would call it a crypto-asset network. The goal is to create a billion-dollar block of pure energy in cyberspace, one that I could then move with no friction at the speed of light. It‚Äôs the equivalent to putting a million pounds in orbit. How do I actually launch something into orbit? How do I launch something into cyberspace such that it moves friction-free? And the solution is a decentralized proof-of-work network. Satoshi‚Äôs solution was: I‚Äôm going to establish a protocol running on a distributed set of computers that will maintain a constant supply of never more than 21 million Bitcoin subdividable by a hundred million satoshis each, transferable via transferring private keys. Now, the innovation is to create that in an ethical, durable fashion. The ethical innovation is: I want it to be property and not a security. A bushel of corn, an acre of land, a stack of lumber, a bar of gold, and a Bitcoin are all property ‚Äî and that means they‚Äôre all commonly occurring elements in the world. You could call them commodities, but commodity is a little bit misleading ‚Äî and I‚Äôll tell you why in a second ‚Äî but they‚Äôre all distinguished by the fact that no one entity or person or government controls them. If you have a barrel of oil and you‚Äôre in Ukraine versus Russia versus Saudi Arabia versus the US, you have a barrel of oil, and it doesn‚Äôt matter what the premier in Japan or the mayor of Miami Beach thinks about your barrel of oil. They cannot wave their hand and make it not a barrel of oil or a cord of wood. And so, property is just a naturally occurring element in the universe. Lex Fridman: Why use the word ethical? Why ethical, assigned to property? Michael Saylor: Because if it‚Äôs a security ‚Äî a security would be an example of a share of a stock or a crypto token controlled by a small team ‚Äî in the event that something is a security because some small group or some identifiable group can control its nature, character, supply, then it really only becomes ethical to promote it or sell it pursuant to fair disclosures. So I‚Äôll give you maybe a practical example: I‚Äôm the mayor of Chicago. I give a speech. In my speech I say, I think everybody in Chicago should own their own farm and a chicken in the backyard, and their own horse, and an automobile ‚Äî that‚Äôs ethical. I give the same speech and I say, I think everybody in Chicago should buy Twitter stock, sell their house, or sell their cash, and buy Twitter stock ‚Äî well, is that ethical? Not really. At that point you‚Äôve entered into a conflict of interest, because what you‚Äôre doing is you‚Äôre promoting an asset which is substantially controlled by a small group of people ‚Äî the board of directors or the CEO of the company. So how would you feel if the president of the United States said, I really think Americans should all buy Apple stock. Especially if you worked at Google. But if you worked anywhere, you‚Äôd be like, Why isn‚Äôt he saying, Buy mine? A security is a proprietary asset in some way, shape, or form. And the whole nature of securities law, it starts from this ancient idea: Thou shalt not lie, cheat, or steal. So if I‚Äôm going to sell you securities or I‚Äôm going to promote securities as a public figure or as an influencer or anybody else, if I create my own Yo-Yo coin or Mikeycoin and then there‚Äôs a million of them and I tell you that I think that it‚Äôs a really good thing and Mikeycoin will go up forever, everybody buys Mikeycoin and then I give $10 million to you and don‚Äôt tell the public ‚Äî I‚Äôve cheated them. Maybe if I have Mikeycoin and I think there‚Äôs only two million Mikeycoin and I swear to you there‚Äôs only two million and then I get married and I have three kids and my third kid is in the hospital and my kid‚Äôs gonna die and I have this ethical reason to print five hundred thousand more Mikeycoin or else people are gonna die and everybody tells me it‚Äôs fine ‚Äî I‚Äôve still abused the investor, right? It‚Äôs an ethical challenge. If you look at ethics laws everywhere in the world, they all boil down to having a clause which says that if you‚Äôre a public figure you can‚Äôt endorse a security. You can‚Äôt endorse something that would cause you to have a conflict of interest. So if you‚Äôre a mayor, a governor, a country, a public figure, an influencer, and you want to promote or promulgate or support something using any public influence or funds or resources you may have, it needs to be property ‚Äî it can‚Äôt be a security. So it goes beyond that, right? I mean, would the Chinese want to support an American company? As soon as you look at what‚Äôs in the best interest of the human race, the civilization, you realize that if you want an ethical path forward, it needs to be based on common property which is fair. And the way you get to a common property is through an open, permissionless protocol. If It‚Äôs not open ‚Äî if it‚Äôs proprietary and I know what the code says and you don‚Äôt know what the code says ‚Äî that makes it a security. If it‚Äôs permissioned ‚Äî if you‚Äôre not allowed on my network or if you can be censored or booted off my network, that also makes it a security. So when I talk about property ‚Äî I mean, the challenge here is: How do I create something that‚Äôs equivalent to a barrel of oil in cyberspace? And that means it has to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument, open, permissionless, not censorable. If I could do that, then I could deliver you ten thousand dematerialized barrels of oil and you would take settlement of them and you would know that you have possession of that property irregardless of the opinion of any politician or any company or anybody else in the world ‚Äî that‚Äôs a really critical characteristic, and it actually is it‚Äôs probably one of the fundamental things that makes Bitcoin special. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a crypto-asset network ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to create a crypto asset network. It‚Äôs very hard to create an ethical crypto-asset network, because you have to create one without any government or corporation or investor exercising undue influence to make it successful. Lex Fridman [timestamp 1:48:38]: So: open, permissionless, non-censorable ‚Äî so basically no way for you, without explicitly saying so, outsourcing control to somebody else. So you have full control. Even with the barrel of oil, what‚Äôs the difference between a barrel of oil and a Bitcoin to you? Because you mentioned that both are property ‚Äî you mentioned Russia and China and so on. Is it the ability of the government to confiscate? In the end, governments can probably confiscate no matter what the asset is, but you want to lessen the effort involved. Michael Saylor: A barrel oil is a bucket of physical liquid property. Bitcoin is a digital property. Lex Fridman: But it‚Äôs easier to confiscate a barrel of oil. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs easier to confiscate things in the real world than things in cyberspace ‚Äî much easier. Lex Fridman: So that‚Äôs not universally true ‚Äî some things in the digital space are actually easier to confiscate because just the nature of how things move easily with information, right? Michael Saylor: I think in the Bitcoin world, what we would say is that Bitcoin is the most difficult property ‚Äî that the human race possesses or has yet invented ‚Äî to confiscate. And that‚Äôs by virtue of the fact that you could take possession of it via your private key. So if you got your 12 seed phrases in your head then that would be the highest form of property right, because I literally have to crack your head open and read your mind to take it. It doesn‚Äôt mean I couldn‚Äôt extract it from you under duress, but it means that it‚Äôs harder than every other thing you might own ‚Äî in fact, it‚Äôs exponentially harder. If you consider every other thing you might own ‚Äî a car, a house, a share of stock, gold, diamonds, property rights, intellectual property rights, movie rights, music rights, anything imaginable ‚Äî they would all be easier by orders and orders of magnitude to seize. So digital property in the form of a set of private keys is by far the apex property of the human race. In terms of ethics, I want to make one more point: I might say to you Lex, I think Bitcoin is the best, most secure, most durable crypto-asset network in the world, is going to go up forever, and there‚Äôs nothing better in the world. I might be right, I might be wrong, but the point is: because it‚Äôs property, it‚Äôs ethical for me to say that. If I were to turn around and say, You know, Lex, I think the same about Microstrategy stock ‚Äî $MSTR ‚Äî that‚Äôs a security. If I‚Äôm wrong about that, I have civil liability or other liability, because I could go to a board meeting tomorrow and I could actually propose we issue a million more shares of Microstrategy stock. Whereas, the thing that makes Bitcoin ethical for me to even promote is the knowledge that I can‚Äôt change it. If I knew that I could make it 42 million instead of 21 million and I had the button back here, then then I have a different degree of ethical responsibility. Now, I could tell you your life will be better if you buy Bitcoin and it might not ‚Äî you might go buy Bitcoin, you might lose the keys and be bankrupt and your life ends and your life is not better because you bought Bitcoin, but it wouldn‚Äôt be my ethical liability any more than if I were to say, Lex, I think you ought to get a farm. I think you should be a farmer. I think a chicken in every pot. You should get a horse. I think you‚Äôd be better ‚Äî I mean, these are all opinions expressed about property which may or may not be right, that you may or may not agree with. But in a legal sense, if we read the law ‚Äî if we understand securities law, and I would say most people in the crypto industry, they didn‚Äôt take companies public and so they‚Äôre not really focused on the securities law, they don‚Äôt even know the securities law ‚Äî if you focus on the securities law, that would say: You just can‚Äôt legally sell this stuff to the general public or promote it without a full set of continuing disclosures signed off on by a regulator. So there‚Äôs a fairly bright line there with regard to securities, but when you get to the secondary issue it‚Äôs: How do you actually build a world based on digital property if public figures can‚Äôt embrace it or endorse it? You see? So you‚Äôre not going to build a better world based upon Twitter stock, if that‚Äôs your idea of property, because Twitter stock is a security and Twitter stock is never going to be a non-sovereign bearer instrument in Russia or in China ‚Äî it‚Äôs not even legal in China. So it‚Äôs not a global, permissionless, open thing. It will never be trusted by the rest of the world, and legally it‚Äôs impractical. Would you really want to put $100 trillion dollars worth of economic value on Twitter stock if there‚Äôs a board of directors and a CEO that could just get up and take half of it tomorrow? The answer is: No. So if you want to build a better world based on digital energy, you need to start with constructing a digital property. And I‚Äôm using property here in a legal sense, but I would also go to the next step and say: property is low frequency money. So if I give you a million dollars and you want to hold it for a decade, you might go buy a house with it. And the house is low frequency money ‚Äî you converted the million dollars of economic energy into a structure called a house. Maybe after a decade you might convert it back into energy ‚Äî you might sell the house for currency, and it‚Äôll be more worth more or less depending upon the monetary climate. Lex Fridman [timestamp 1:55:08]: The frequency means what here? How quickly it changes state? Michael Saylor: How quickly does something vibrate. So if I transfer $10 from me to you for a drink and then you turn around you buy another, we‚Äôre vibrating on a frequency of every few hours ‚Äî the energy is changing hands. But it‚Äôs not likely that you sell and buy houses every few hours, right? The frequency of a transaction in real estate is every 10 years, every 5 years ‚Äî it‚Äôs a much lower frequency transaction. And so when you think about what‚Äôs going on here, you have extremely low frequency things which we‚Äôll call property, then you have mid frequency things I‚Äôm going to call a money or currency, and then you have high frequency and that‚Äôs energy. And that‚Äôs why I use the illustration of: you got the building, you got the light, and you got the sound, and they‚Äôre all just energy moving at different frequencies. Now, Bitcoin is magical and it‚Äôs truly the innovation ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a singularity, because it represents the first time in the history of the human race that we managed to create a digital property, properly understood. It‚Äôs easy to create something digital, right? Every coupon and every skin on Fortnite and Roblox and Apple TV credits and all these things, they‚Äôre all digital something, but they‚Äôre securities. Shares of stock are securities. When you transfer money on PayPal or Apple Pay, you‚Äôre transferring, in essence, a security or an IOU, and so transferring a bearer instrument with final settlement in the Internet domain or in cyberspace ‚Äî that‚Äôs a critical thing ‚Äî and anybody in the crypto world can do that. All the cryptos can do that, but what they can‚Äôt do ‚Äî what 99% of them fail to do ‚Äî is be property. They‚Äôre securities. Lex Fridman: Well there‚Äôs a line there I‚Äôd like to explore a little further: for example, what about when Coinbase or something like that, when there‚Äôs an exchange that you buy Bitcoin in, you start to move away from some of the aspects that you said makes up a property, which is this non-censorable and permissionless and open ‚Äî so in order to achieve the convenience, the effectiveness of the transfer of energy, you have to leverage some of these places that remove the aspects of property. So I mean, maybe you can comment on that? Michael Saylor: Let me give you a good model for that: if you think about the layer one of Bitcoin, the layer one is the property settlement layer and we‚Äôre going to do 350,000 transactions or less a day, 100 million transactions a year is the bandwidth on the layer one. And it would be an ideal layer one to move a billion dollars from Point A to Point B with the massive security. The role of the layer one is two things: one thing is I want to move a large sum of money through space with security. I can move any amount of Bitcoin in a matter of minutes for dollars on layer one. The second important feature of the layer one is: I need the money to last forever. I need the money indestructible, immortal. So the bigger trick is not to move a billion dollars from here to Tokyo ‚Äî the big trick is to move a billion dollars from here to the year 2140. And that‚Äôs what we want to solve with layer one. And the best real metaphor in New York City would be the granite or the schist. What you want is a city block of bedrock. And how long has it been there? Millions of years, it‚Äôs been there. And how fast you want it to move? You don‚Äôt. In fact the single thing that‚Äôs most important is that it not deflect. If it deflects a foot in a hundred years, it‚Äôs too much. If it deflects an inch in a hundred years, you might not want that. So the layer one of Bitcoin is a foundation upon which you put weight. How much weight can you put on it? You could put a trillion, $10 trillion, $100 trillion, a quadrillion. How much weight is on the bedrock in Manhattan, right? Think about 100-story buildings. So the real key there is: the foundational asset needs to be there at all. So the fact that you can create a $100 trillion dollar layer one that would stand for 100 years ‚Äî that is the revolutionary breakthrough ‚Äî first time. And the fact that it‚Äôs ethical and it‚Äôs common property, global, permissionless. Extremely unlikely that would happen ‚Äî people tried 50 times before and they all failed. They tried 15,000 times after and they‚Äôve all generally failed. 98% have failed and a couple have been less successful, but for the most part. That‚Äôs an extraordinary thing. Lex Fridman [timestamp 2:00:54]: Now let‚Äôs just really quickly pause just to define some terms. For you people that don‚Äôt know: layer one, that Michael‚Äôs referring to, is in general what people know of as the Bitcoin technology originally defined, which is the blockchain. There‚Äôs a consensus mechanism of proof-of-work. Low number of transactions but you can move a very large amount of money. The reason he‚Äôs using the term layer one is that now there‚Äôs a lot of ideas of layer two technologies built on top of this bedrock that allow you to move a much larger number of transactions at higher frequency ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know how what terminology you want to use ‚Äî but basically be able to use now something that is based on Bitcoin to then buy stuff, be a consumer, to transfer money, to use it as currency. Just to define some terms. Michael Saylor: Yeah. So the layer one is the foundation for the entire cyber-economy. And we don‚Äôt want it to move fast. What we want is immortal, incorruptible, indestructible. That‚Äôs what you want: integrity from the layer one. Now there‚Äôs layer two and layer three. And layer two I would define as an open, permissionless, non-custodial protocol that uses the underlying layer one token as its gas fee. Lex Fridman: So what‚Äôs custodial mean? And how does the different markets ‚Äî like is Lightning Network? Michael Saylor: So Lightning Network would be an example of a layer two ‚Äî non-custodial. So the Lightning Network will sit on top of layer one ‚Äî it‚Äôll sit on top of Bitcoin ‚Äî and what you want to do is solve the problem of: It‚Äôs well and fine, I don‚Äôt want to move a billion dollars every day, what I want to move is five dollars a billion times a day. So if I want to move five dollars a billion times a day, I don‚Äôt really need to put the entire trillion dollars of assets at risk every time I move five dollars. All I really need to do is put a hundred thousand dollars in a channel, or a million dollars in a channel, and then I do 10 million transactions where I have a million dollars at risk. And of course it‚Äôs kind of simple: if I lower my security requirement by a factor of a million, I can probably move the stuff a million times faster. And that‚Äôs how Lightning works. It‚Äôs non-custodial because there‚Äôs no corporation or custodian or counterparty you‚Äôre trusting ‚Äî there‚Äôs the risk of moving through the channel. But Lightning is an example of how I go from 50,000 transactions a day to 350 million transactions a day. So on that layer two you could move the Bitcoin in seconds for fractions of pennies. Now, that‚Äôs not the end-all, be-all because the truth is there are a lot of open protocols. Lightning probably won‚Äôt be the only one ‚Äî there‚Äôs an open market competition of other permissionless, open source protocols to do this work. And in theory, any other crypto network that was deemed to be property ‚Äî deemed to be not a security ‚Äî you could also think of as potentially a layer two to Bitcoin. There‚Äôs a debate about: Are there any? And what are they? And we could leave that for a later time. Lex Fridman: But why do you think of them as layer two as opposed to contending for layer one? Michael Saylor: If they‚Äôre using their own token then they are a layer one. If you create an open protocol that uses the Bitcoin token as the fee then it becomes a layer two. Bitcoin itself incentivizes it‚Äôs own transactions with its own token and that‚Äôs what makes it layer one. Lex Fridman: Okay, what‚Äôs layer three then? Michael Saylor [timestamp 2:05:14]: Layer three is a custodial layer, so if you want to move Bitcoin in milliseconds for free, you move it through Binance or Coinbase or Cash App. So this is a very straightforward thing: I mean it seems pretty obvious when you think about it that they are gonna be hundreds of thousands of layer threes. There may be dozens of layer twos. Lightning is a one, but it‚Äôs not the only one ‚Äî anybody can invent something. And we can have this debate about custodial, non-custodial ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs monopolization possibilities at layer three? So you mentioned Binance, Coinbase ‚Äî what if they start to dominate and basically everybody is using them, practically speaking, and then it becomes too costly to memorize the private key in your brain or like a cold storage of layer one technology? Michael Saylor: Well, the idealists fear the layer threes because they would detest ‚Äî there‚Äôs almost like a layer four, by the way, if you want to. A layer four would be: I‚Äôve got Bitcoin on an application but I can‚Äôt withdraw it. So I‚Äôve got an application that‚Äôs backed by Bitcoin but the Bitcoin is sealed. It‚Äôs a proprietary example. An example of that would be like Grayscale: if I own a share of $GBTC and so I own a security ‚Äî actually you could own $MSTR. If you own a security or you own a product that has Bitcoin embedded in it, you get the benefits of Bitcoin but you don‚Äôt have the ability to withdraw the asset. Lex Fridman: So you have a security market at layer four? Am I understanding this correctly? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt know if I would say ‚Äî not all securities are layer four, but anything that‚Äôs a proprietary product with Bitcoin embedded in it where you can‚Äôt withdraw the Bitcoin, is another application of Bitcoin. So if you think about different ways you can use this, you can either stay completely on the layer one and use the base chain for your transactions, or you can limit yourself to layer one and layer two Lightning ‚Äî and the purist would say we stay there: get your Bitcoin off the exchange. But you could also go to the layer three when Cash App supported Bitcoin they made it very easy to buy it and then they gave you the ability to withdraw. When PayPal or I think Robinhood let you buy it, they wouldn‚Äôt let you withdraw it and it was a big community uproar. People want these layer threes to make it possible to withdraw the Bitcoin so you could take it to your own private wallet and get it off the exchange. I think the answer to the question of, Well is corruption possible? is: corruption is possible in all human institutions and all governments everywhere. The difference between digital property and physical property is: when you own a building in Los Angeles and the city politics turn against you, can‚Äôt move the building. And when you own a share of a security that‚Äôs like a US-traded security and you wish to move to some other country, you can‚Äôt take the security with you either. And when you own a bunch of gold and you try to get through the airport, they might not let you take it. So Bitcoin is advantageous versus all of those because you actually do have the option to withdraw your asset from the exchange. And if you had Bitcoin with Fidelity and you had shares of stock with Fidelity and if you had bonds and sovereign debt with Fidelity and if you owned some some mutual funds and some other random limited partnerships with Fidelity, none of those things can be removed from the custodian, but the Bitcoin you can take off the exchange ‚Äî you can remove from the custodian. There‚Äôs a deterrent that‚Äôs an anti-corrupting element, and the phrase is: an armed society is a polite society. Because you have the optionality to withdraw all your assets from the crypto exchange, you can enforce fairness. And at the point where you disagree with their policies you can, within an hour, move your assets to another counterparty or take personal custody of those assets. And you don‚Äôt have that option with most other forms of property. You don‚Äôt have as much optionality with any other form of property on Earth. And so what what makes digital property distinct is the fact that it has the most optionality for custody. Now coming back to this digital energy issue, the real key point is: the energy moves in milliseconds for free on layer threes. It moves in seconds or less than seconds on layer twos. It moves in minutes on the layer one. And I don‚Äôt think it makes any sense to even think about trying to solve all three problems on the layer one because it‚Äôs impossible to achieve the security and the incorruptibility and the immortality if you try to build in that much speed and that functionality and performance. In fact, if you come back to the New York model, you really wanted a block of granite, a building, and a company ‚Äî that‚Äôs what makes the economy. If I said to you: you‚Äôre going to build a building but you can only have one company in it for the life of the building, it would be very fragile, very brittle. What company a hundred years ago is still relevant today? You want all three layers because they all oscillate at different frequencies. And there‚Äôs a tendency to think, Well it‚Äôs got to be this L1 or that L1 ‚Äî not really. And sometimes people think, Well I don‚Äôt really want any L3, but it‚Äôs not an either/or: companies are better than crypto-asset networks at certain things. If you want to implement complexity or you want to implement compliance or customer service, companies do these things well. You couldn‚Äôt decentralize Apple or Netflix or even YouTube ‚Äî the performance wouldn‚Äôt be there, and the subtlety wouldn‚Äôt be there. And you can‚Äôt really legally decentralize certain forms of banking and insurance, because they would become illegal in the political jurisdiction they‚Äôre in. So unless you‚Äôre a cryptoanarchist and you believe in no companies and no nation states ‚Äî which, it‚Äôs just not very practical, not anytime soon ‚Äî once you allow that nation states will continue and companies have a role, then the layered architecture follows and the free market determines who wins. For example, there are layer threes that let you acquire Bitcoin and withdraw Bitcoin. There are other applications that let you acquire but not withdraw it. And they don‚Äôt get the same market share but they might give you some other advantage. There are there are certain layer threes like Jack Dorsey‚Äôs Cash App where they just incorporated Lightning ‚Äî an implementation of it ‚Äî so that makes it more advantageous versus an application that doesn‚Äôt incorporate Lightning. If you think about the big picture: the big picture is 8 billion people with mobile phones served by a hundred million companies doing billions of transactions an hour, and the companies are settling with each other on the base layer in blocks of $80 million at a time, and then the companies are trading with the consumers in proprietary layers like layer three, and then on occasion, people are shuffling assets across custodians with Lightning layer two because you don‚Äôt want to pay $5 to move $50 ‚Äî you want to pay a twentieth of a penny to move $50. And so all of these things create efficiency in the economy. And Lex, if you want to consider how much efficiency: if you gave me a billion dollars in 20 years, I couldn‚Äôt find a way to trade with another company or a counterparty in Nigeria ‚Äî no amount of money. Give me $10 billion dollars ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt do it, because you get shut down at the banking level, you can‚Äôt link up a bank in Nigeria with a bank in the US, you get shut down at this credit card level because they don‚Äôt have the credit card so they won‚Äôt clear, you get shut down at the compliance FCPA level because if you wouldn‚Äôt be able to implement a system that interfaced with somebody else‚Äôs system if it‚Äôs not in the right political jurisdiction. On the other hand, three entrepreneurs in Nigeria on the weekend could create a website that would trade in this Lightning economy using open protocols without asking anybody‚Äôs permission. So you‚Äôre talking about something that‚Äôs like a million times cheaper, less friction, and faster to do it if you want to get money to move. Lex Fridman [timestamp 2:15:27]: What do you think that looks like? Now there‚Äôs a war going on in Ukraine, there‚Äôs other wars, Yemen, going on throughout the world ‚Äî in this most difficult of states that a nation can be in, which is at war, civil war, or war with other nations, what‚Äôs the role of Bitcoin in this context? Michael Saylor: I mean, Bitcoin‚Äôs a universal trust protocol. A universal energy protocol, if you will. English is one. What I see is a bunch of fragmentation of applications. For example, the Russian payment app is not going to work in Ukraine. The Ukraine payment app is not going to work in Russia. The US payment apps won‚Äôt work in either of those places as far as I know. And in Argentina, their payment app may not work in certain parts of Africa. So what you have is different local economies where people spin up their own applications compliant with their own local laws, or in war zones not compliant, but just spinning up ‚Äî Lex Fridman: So how do you build something that‚Äôs not compliant? What is the revolutionary act here when you don‚Äôt agree with the government or you want to free yourself from the constraints ‚Äî so here‚Äôs the thing: when a nation is really at war, especially if it‚Äôs an authoritarian regime, it‚Äôs going to try to control the population, like lock everything down, the spread of information. How do you break through that? Do you do the thing that you mentioned, which is that you have to build another app, essentially, that allows you the flow of money outside the legal constraints placed on you by the government? So basically break the law? Michael Saylor: Metaphorically speaking, if you want to break out of the constraints of your culture, you learn to speak English. For example, it‚Äôs not illegal to speak English ‚Äî or even if it is, it doesn‚Äôt matter. But English works everywhere in the world if you can speak it and then you can tap into a global commerce and intelligence network. So Bitcoin is a language, so you learn to speak Bitcoin or you learn to speak Lightning and then you tap into that network in whatever manner you can. Lex Fridman: But the problem is it‚Äôs still very difficult to move Bitcoin around in Russia and Ukraine now during war. And there was a sense to me that cryptocurrency in general could be the savior for helping people there. There‚Äôs millions of refugees ‚Äî they‚Äôre moving all around. It‚Äôs very difficult to move money around in that space to help people. Michael Saylor: I think we‚Äôre very early. Like, we‚Äôre very embryonic here. Lex Fridman: Who‚Äôs we? We as a human civilization? Or we operating in the cryptocurrency space? Michael Saylor: I think the entire crypto economy is very embryonic, and the human race‚Äôs adoption of it is embryonic ‚Äî we‚Äôre like 1%-2% down that adoption curve. If you take Lightning, for example, the first real commercial applications of Lightning are just in the last 12 months. So we‚Äôre like year one ‚Äî we might be approaching year two of commercial Lightning adoption ‚Äî and if you look at Lightning adoption, Lightning is not built into Coinbase, it‚Äôs not built into Binance, it‚Äôs not built into FTX, Cash App just implemented the first implementation but not all of the features are built into it. There‚Äôs a few dozen, a dozen Lightning wallets circulating out there. So I think that we‚Äôre probably going to be 36 months of software development. At the point that every Android phone and every iPhone has a Bitcoin wallet or a crypto wallet in it of sorts ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big deal. If Apple embraced Lightning, that‚Äôs a big deal. Lex Fridman: So the adoption is the thing ‚Äî like in a war zone, adoption ‚Äî the people who struggle the most in war are people who are weren‚Äôt doing that great before the war started. They don‚Äôt have the technological sophistication. The hackers and all those kinds of people will find a way. It‚Äôs just regular people who are just struggling to make day-by-day living. And so if the adoption permeates the entire culture, then you can start to move money around in the digital space. If you can psychoanalyze Jack Dorsey for a second: so he‚Äôs one of the early adopters, or he‚Äôs one of the people pushing the early adoption in this layer three inside Cash App ‚Äî what do you make of the man? Of this decision? As a business owner, as somebody playing in the space: why did he do it? And what does that mean for others at the scale that might be doing the same? So: incorporating the Lightning Network, incorporating Bitcoin into their products. Michael Saylor: I think he‚Äôs been pretty clear about this: he feels that Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment for billions of people that are unbanked and have no property rights in the world. If you want to give an incorruptible bank to 8 billion people on the planet, that‚Äôs the same as asking the question: How do you give a full education through PhD-level to 8 billion people on the planet? And the answer is: a digital version of the 20th century thing running on a mobile phone. And Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace. It‚Äôs run by uncorruptable software and it‚Äôs for everybody on Earth. So I think when Jack looks at it, he‚Äôs very sensitive to the plight of everybody in Africa. If you look at Africans ‚Äî you‚Äôre going to give them banks? You‚Äôre not going to put a bank branch on every corner ‚Äî that‚Äôs an obscene waste of energy. You‚Äôre not going to run copper wires across the continent ‚Äî that‚Äôs an obscene waste of energy. You‚Äôre not gonna give them gold. So how are you going to provide people with a decent life? The metaphor I think is relevant here, the biological metaphor, Lex, is Type I diabetic: if you‚Äôre a Type I diabetic, you can‚Äôt form fat, and if you can‚Äôt form fat then you can‚Äôt store excess energy. Fat is the ultimate organic battery, and if you‚Äôve got 30 pounds of it you can go 60 days without eating. But if you can‚Äôt generate insulin you can‚Äôt form fat cells, and if you can‚Äôt form fat cells and store energy then you can eat yourself to death. I mean you will eat and you will die ‚Äî you‚Äôll starve to death. So the lack of property rights is like being a Type I diabetic. And so if you look at most people everywhere in the world: they don‚Äôt have property rights, they don‚Äôt have an effective bank, and their currency is broken. Like, what are the two things that in theory would serve as the equivalent of an organic battery or an economic battery to civilization? It would be: I have a currency which holds its value and I can store it in a bank. So a risk-free currency derivative. I pay you your money, you take your life savings, you put it in the bank, you save up for your retirement, you live happily ever after ‚Äî that‚Äôs the American Dream. That‚Äôs the idyllic situation. The real situation is: there are no banks, you can‚Äôt get a bank account, so I give your pay in currency and then I double the supply and I give it to my cousin or I give it to whatever cause I want or I use it to buy weapons and then you find a loaf of bread costs triple next month as what it cost and your life savings is worthless. And so in that environment, everybody‚Äôs ripped back to stone age barter. And the problem with that, even with stone age barter, is: you‚Äôre going to carry your life savings on your back? And what happens when the guy with a machine gun points it at your head and just takes your life savings? So I think from Jack‚Äôs point of view, he thinks that life is ‚Äî this is maybe too strong but these are my words ‚Äî life is hopeless for a lot of people, and Bitcoin is hope, because it gives everyone an engineered monetary asset that‚Äôs a bearer instrument and it gives them a bank on their mobile phone and they don‚Äôt have to trust their government or another counterparty with their life force. So there‚Äôs a secondary thing I think he‚Äôs interested in which is ‚Äî the first thing is the human rights issue ‚Äî and the second thing would be: the friction to trade cross-borders is so great. Like, you like AI so I‚Äôll give you a beautiful notion: maybe one day there‚Äôll be an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is self-sufficient and rich. Lex Fridman: Like, that would have sovereignty? Michael Saylor: Can a robot own money or property? Can a Tesla car? Can I actually put enough money in a car for it to drive itself and maintain itself forever? Or can I create an artificially intelligent creature in cyberspace that is endowed such that it would live a thousand years and continue to do its job? We have a word for that in the real world: it‚Äôs institution ‚Äî Harvard, Cambridge, Stanford ‚Äî there are institutions with endowments that go on in perpetuity. But what if I wanted to perpetuate a software program? And with something like digital property ‚Äî with Bitcoin and Lightning ‚Äî you could do it. And on the other hand, with banks and credit cards, you couldn‚Äôt ‚Äî you couldn‚Äôt ever. So you can create things that are beautiful and lasting. And what‚Äôs the difference in speed? Well, so I can either trade with everybody in the world at the speed of light friction-free in 24 hours writing a python script, or I can spend $100 billion dollars to trade with a few million people in the world after it takes them 6 months of application. The impedance is like a 10,000,000:1 difference, and the metaphors are literally like launching something in orbit versus almost orbit, or vacuum sealing something. Does it last forever and does it orbit forever? Or does it go up and come down and burn up? And I think Jack is interested in putting freedom in orbit. And he said it many times. He said: the Internet needs a native currency. And no political construct or security can be a native currency. You need a property. And you need a property that can be moved a million times a second. Can you oscillate it at 10 kilohertz or 100 kilohertz? And the answer is: only if it‚Äôs a pure digital construct ‚Äî permissionless and open. And so I think he‚Äôs enthusiastic as the technologist and he‚Äôs enthusiastic as the humanitarian. And what he‚Äôs doing is to support both those areas. He‚Äôs supporting the Bitcoin and the Lightning protocols by building them into his products, but he‚Äôs also building the applications which you need at the Cash App level in order to commercialize and deliver the functionality and the compliance necessary, and they‚Äôre related. Lex Fridman [timestamp 2:28:24]: And I should also say he‚Äôs just a fascinating person ‚Äî for a random reason that I couldn‚Äôt even explain if I tried ‚Äî I met him a few days ago and gave him a great big hug in the middle of nowhere. There was no explanation ‚Äî he just appeared. That‚Äôs a fascinating human: his relationship with art, with the world, with human suffering, with technology is fascinating. I don‚Äôt know what his path looks like, but it‚Äôs interesting that people like that exist. And in part I‚Äôm saddened that he no longer is involved with Twitter directly as a CEO, because I was hoping something inside Twitter would also integrate some of these ideas of what you‚Äôre calling digital energy, to see how social networks ‚Äî something I‚Äôm really interested in and passionate about ‚Äî could be transformed. Let me ask you just for educational purposes: can you please explain to me what Web 3.0 and the beef between Jack and Marc Andreessen is exactly? Did you see what happened? Sorry to have you analyze Twitter like it‚Äôs Shakespeare, but can you please explain to me why there was any drama over this topic? Michael Saylor: First of all, Web 3.0 is a term that‚Äôs used to refer to the part of the economy that‚Äôs token finance. So if I‚Äôm launching an application and my ideas is to create a token along with the application and issue the token to the community so as to finance the application and build support for it, I think that that‚Äôs the most common interpretation of Web 3.0. There are other interpretations too, and so I‚Äôm just gonna refer to that one. And I think the beef in a nutshell ‚Äî not articulated, but I‚Äôll articulate it ‚Äî is whether or not you should focus all your energy creating applications on top of an ethical digital property like Bitcoin, or whether you should attempt to create a competitor to it which generally would be deemed as a security by the Bitcoin community. So I‚Äôm going to put on my Bitcoin hat here: all the tokens that have been [released], if it‚Äôs driven by a venture capitalist, was a security ‚Äî if there‚Äôs a CEO and a CTO, it‚Äôs a security. All these projects ‚Äî they‚Äôre companies. Foundations are companies. If you call them a project or a foundation, it doesn‚Äôt make it not a security ‚Äî they‚Äôre all in essence collections of individuals that are issuing equity in the form of a token. And if there‚Äôs a premine, an IPO, an ICO, a foundation, or any kind of any kind of protocol where there is a group of engineers that have influence over it, then to a securities lawyer or to most Bitcoiners and definitely to anybody that‚Äôs steeped in securities law, you‚Äôre looking at it and you say, Well that passes the Howie test: it looks like a security. It should be sold to the public pursuant to disclosures and regulations, and you‚Äôre just ducking the IPO process. And so now we get back to the ethical issue. Well the ethical issue is: if you‚Äôre trading it as a commodity and representing it as a commodity while truthfully it‚Äôs a security, then it‚Äôs a violation of ethics rules and it‚Äôs probably illegal. Lex Fridman: Well you keep leaning on this ‚Äî let me push back on that part. Maybe you can educate me, but you keep leaning on this line of securities law ‚Äî with all due respect to lawyers ‚Äî as if that line somehow defines what is and isn‚Äôt ethical. I think there‚Äôs a lot of correlation, as you‚Äôve discussed, but and I‚Äôd like to leave the line aside. If the law calls something a security, it doesn‚Äôt mean, in my eyes, that it is unethical. I mean there could be some technicalities and lawyers and people play games with this kind of stuff all the time. But I take your bigger point that, if there‚Äôs a CEO, if there‚Äôs a project lead, to you that‚Äôs fundamentally different than the structure of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not that creating securities is unethical ‚Äî I created a security. I took a company public. That‚Äôs not the unethical part. It‚Äôs completely ethical to create securities. Block is a security. All companies are securities. The unethical part is to represent it as property when it‚Äôs a security, and to promote it or trade it as such. Lex Fridman: This whole promotion ‚Äî that‚Äôs also a technical thing because what counts as or as not a promotion is a legal thing, and you get in trouble for all these things, but that‚Äôs the game that lawyers play. There‚Äôs an ethical thing here which is like: what‚Äôs right to promote and not? To me, propaganda is unethical, but it‚Äôs usually not illegal. Michael Saylor: If you roll the clock back 20 years, all the boiler room pump and dump schemes were all about someone pitching a penny stock selling swampland in Florida. And if you roll the clock forward 20 years and I create my own company and I represent it as the same thing and I don‚Äôt make the disclosures, you‚Äôre just one step removed from the boiler room scheme, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs distasteful about it. There are ways to sell securities to the public, but there are expectations. Maybe we could forget about whether the security laws are ethical or not ‚Äî I will leave that alone. We‚Äôll just start with the biblical definition of ethics: Don‚Äôt lie, cheat, or steal. So if I‚Äôm going to sell something to you, I need to fully disclose what I‚Äôm selling to you. And that‚Äôs a matter of great debate right now. And so I think that‚Äôs part of the debate. But the other part of the debate is whether or not we need more than one token. Like, we need at least one, right? We need at least one digital property. Lex Fridman: One is better than zero. Michael Saylor: Zero means there is no digital economy. And by the way, the conventional view of maximalists is they think there‚Äôs only one and everything else isn‚Äôt ‚Äî that‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm going to make. I would say: we know there is at least one digital property, and that is Bitcoin. If you can create a truly decentralized, non-custodial, bearer instrument that is not under the control of any organization that is fairly distributed, then you might create another, or multiple. And there may be others out there. But I think that the frustration of a lot of people in the Bitcoin community ‚Äî and I share this with Jack ‚Äî is: we could create $100 trillion dollars of value in the real world simply by building applications on top of Bitcoin as a foundation. And so continually trying to reinvent the wheel and create competitive things is a massive waste of time, and it‚Äôs a diversion of human creativity. It‚Äôs like: we have an ethical good thing and now we‚Äôre going to try to create a third or a fourth one ‚Äî why? Lex Fridman: Well let‚Äôs talk about it. So first of all I‚Äôm with you. But let me ask you this interesting question, because we talked about properties and securities. Let‚Äôs talk about conflict of interest. So you said you could advertise publicly ‚Äî you have a popular Twitter account, it‚Äôs hilarious and insightful ‚Äî you do promote Bitcoin in a sense. I don‚Äôt know if you would say that. But do you think there‚Äôs a conflict of interest in anyone who owns Bitcoin promoting Bitcoin? Is it the same as you promoting farming? Lex Fridman: I would say: No ‚Äî there‚Äôs an interest. I think that you can promote a property or an idea to the extent that you don‚Äôt control it. I think that the point at which you start to have a conflict of interest is when you‚Äôre promoting a proprietary product or a proprietary security. A security in general is a proprietary asset. So for example, if you look at my Twitter, you will find that I make lots of statements about Bitcoin ‚Äî you won‚Äôt ever see me making a statement that, say, Microstrategy stock will go up forever. I‚Äôm not promoting a security, $MSTR, because at the end of the day, $MSTR is a security. It is proprietary. I have proprietary interest in it. I have a disproportionate amount of control and influence on the direction. Lex Fridman: The control is the problem. Because you have interest in both: if Bitcoin is as successful as we‚Äôre talking about, you very possibly can become the richest human on Earth, given how much you own in Bitcoin. The wealthiest, not the richest ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know what those words mean. Michael Saylor: I would benefit economically. Lex Fridman: You would benefit economically. Michael Saylor: That‚Äôs true. Lex Fridman: So the reason that‚Äôs not conflict of interest is because of the word property, that Bitcoin is an idea? And Bitcoin is open? Michael Saylor: Because I don‚Äôt control it. In essence, the ethical line here is: could I print myself 10 million more Bitcoin or not? Lex Fridman: Or can anyone, right? It‚Äôs not just you. It‚Äôs: can anyone? Because, can you promote somebody else‚Äôs? Yes, I guess you can. Like, can you promote $AAPL? Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs like: you could have a Twitter account where you promote oil or you promote camping or you promote family values or promote a carnivore diet or promote the iron man. Lex Fridman: But you‚Äôre not going to get wealthier if you promote camping, because you can‚Äôt own a stake in it. I mean, you own a lot of Bitcoin. What is that? Don‚Äôt you own a stake in the idea? Michael Saylor [timestamp 2:39:31]: Yeah I would grant you that. Lex Fridman: But the lack of control is the fundamental ethical line, that all you are is you‚Äôre a fan of the idea. You believe in the idea and the power of the idea. You can‚Äôt take that idea away from others. Michael Saylor: Let me give you some maybe easier examples: if you were the head of the Marine Corps and someone came to you and said, I created MarineCoin. And the twist on MarineCoin is I want you to tell every marine that they‚Äôll get an extra MarineCoin when they get their next stripe. And then I‚Äôm gonna let you buy MarineCoin now, and then after you buy MarineCoin, I want you to promote it to them. At some point, if you start to have a disproportional influence on it or if you‚Äôre in a conversation with people with disproportionate influence, it becomes conflict of interest. And it would make you profoundly uncomfortable, I think, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting anything that looked like a security. Now, if the head of the Marine Corps started promoting canoeing, you might think he‚Äôs kind of wacky. Maybe like that‚Äôs kind of a waste of time, a distraction, but to the extent that canoeing is not a security, it‚Äôs not a problem. Ultimately, the issue of decentralization is really a criticism of not having‚Äî Lex Fridman: So not having a head. So can Bitcoin be replicated? All the things that you‚Äôre saying that make it a property ‚Äî can that be replicated? Michael Saylor: I think it‚Äôs possible to create other crypto properties. Lex Fridman: Does having a head of a project, [is that] a thing that limits its ability to be a property if you try to replicate a project? Is that the fundamental flaw? Michael Saylor: Look, I think the real fundamental issue is: you just never want it to change. Like, if you really want something decentralized, you want a genetic template that substantially is not going to change for a thousand years. So I think Satoshi said it at one point ‚Äî he said, The nature of the software is such that by version 0.1, its genetic code was set. If there was any development team that‚Äôs continually changing it on a routine basis, it becomes harder and harder to maintain its decentralization, because now there‚Äôs the issue of: Who‚Äôs influencing the changes? So what you really want is a very very simple idea ‚Äî the simplest idea: I‚Äôm just going to keep track of who owns 21 million parts of energy. And when someone proposes big, functional upgrades, you almost don‚Äôt really want that development to go on the base layer ‚Äî you want that development to go on the layer threes because now Cash App has a proprietary set of functionality and it‚Äôs a security, and if you‚Äôre going to promote the use of this thing, you‚Äôre not going to promote the layer three security because that‚Äôs an edge to a given entity and you‚Äôre trusting the counterparty ‚Äî you‚Äôre gonna promote the layer one or at most the layer two. Lex Fridman: Okay, so one of the fascinating things about Bitcoin ‚Äî and sorry to romanticize certain notions ‚Äî but Satoshi Nakamoto, that the founder is anonymous. Maybe you can speak to whether that‚Äôs useful? But also I just like the psychology of that, to imagine that there‚Äôs a human being that was able to create something special and walk away. So first: are you Satoshi Nakamoto? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôm not! No, actually ‚Äî I think the providence is really important, and if I were to look at the highlighted points, I think having a founder that was anonymous or pseudonymous is important. I think the founder disappearing is also important. I think that the fact that the Satoshi coins never moved is also important. I think the lack of an initial coin offering is also important. I think the lack of a corporate sponsor is important. I think the fact that it traded for 15 months with no commercial value was also important. I think that the simplicity of the protocol is very important. And I think that the outcome of the block size wars is very important. And all of those things add up to common property. They‚Äôre all indicia ‚Äî indicators of a digital property as opposed to a security. If there was a Satoshi sitting around sitting on top of $50 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, I don‚Äôt think it would cripple Bitcoin as property, but I think it would undermine its digital property. And if I wanted to undermine a crypto-asset network, I would do the opposite of all those things: I would launch one myself, I would sell 25% or 50% to the general public, I would keep some of the initial ‚Äî I would premine some of the stuff or early mine it, and I would keep an influence on it. Those are all the opposite of what you would do in order to create common property. And so I see the entire story as Satoshi giving a gift of digital property to the human race and disappearing. Lex Fridman: Do you think it was one person? Do you have ideas of who it could be? Michael Saylor: I don‚Äôt care to speculate. Lex Fridman: But do you think it was one person? Michael Saylor: I think it was one person, maybe in conjunction with a bunch of others. I mean, it might have been a group of people that were working together, but certainly there‚Äôs a Satoshi. Lex Fridman: I mean, it‚Äôs just so fascinating to me that one person could be so brave and thoughtful. Or do you think a lot of it is an accident? Like, the block size wars, the decision to make a block a certain size ‚Äî all the things you mentioned led up to the characteristics that make Bitcoin property. Do you think that‚Äôs an accident? Or it was deeply thought through? This is almost like a history of science question. Michael Saylor: People tried forty of them, right? I mean, I think there‚Äôs a history of attempting to create something like this, and it was tried many many times and they failed for different reasons. It‚Äôs like Prometheus tried to start a fire 47 times and maybe the 48th time it sparked. And that‚Äôs how I see this ‚Äî this is the first one that‚Äôs sparked, and it sets a road map for us. And I and I think, if you‚Äôre looking for any one word that characterizes it: it‚Äôs fair. The whole point of the network is it‚Äôs a fair launch, a fair distribution. Like yeah, I have Bitcoin, but I bought it. And in fact, at this point we‚Äôve paid $4 billion dollars of real cash to buy it. If I was sitting on the same position and I had it for free, then there‚Äôs always this question of ‚Äî or I bought it for a nickel a coin or a penny a coin ‚Äî the question is: Was it fair? And that‚Äôs a very hard question to answer. Did you acquire the Bitcoin that you own fairly? And if you roll the clock back, you could have bought it for a nickel or a dime, but that was when it was a million times more likely to fail, right? When the risk was greater, the cost was lower ‚Äî and then over time the risk became lower and the cost became greater. And the real critical thing was to allow the marketplace, absent any powerful interested actor ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost if Satoshi had held a million coins and then stayed engaged for 10 more years tweaking things in the background, there‚Äôd still be that question. But what we‚Äôve got is really a beautiful thing: we‚Äôve got a chain reaction in cyberspace, or an ideology spreading virally in the world that has seasoned in a fair, ethical fashion. Sometimes it‚Äôs a very violent, brutal fashion with all the volatility, and there‚Äôs been a lot of a lot sound and fury along the way. Lex Fridman [timestamp 2:48:37]: How do you psychoanalyze, how do you deal ‚Äî from a financial, from a human perspective ‚Äî with the volatility? You mentioned you could have gotten it for a nickel and the risk was great. Where‚Äôs the risk today? What‚Äôs your sense? Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre 13 years in to this entire activity. I think the risk has never been lower. If you look at all the risks, the risks in the early years are: is the engineering protocol proper? Like, one megabyte block size, 10-minute clock frequency, cryptographies. First, will it be hacked or will it crash? 730,000 blocks in and it hasn‚Äôt crashed. Will it be hacked? It hasn‚Äôt been hacked. But it‚Äôs a Lindy thing, right? You wait 13 years to see if it‚Äôll be hacked. But on the other hand, with a billion dollars it‚Äôs not as interesting a target as it is with $100 billion, and when it gets to be worth a trillion then it‚Äôs a bigger target. So the risk has been bleeding off over time as the network monetized. I think the second question is: Will it be banned? You couldn‚Äôt know ‚Äî it literally could have been banned many times early on. In fact, in 2013 I tweeted on that subject: I thought it would be banned. I made a very infamous tweet: I thought it was gonna be banned. In 2014, the IRS designated it as property and gave it property tax treatment. So they they could have given it a tax treatment where you had to pay tax on the unrealized capital gains every year and it probably would have crushed it to death, right? So it could have been ‚Äî in any in any number of places ‚Äî banned by a government, but in fact it was legitimized as property. And then the question is: Would it be hacked or would it be copied? Would there be something better than that? And it was copied 15,000 times. And you know the story of all those, and they either diverge to be something totally different and not comparable, or someone trying to copy a non-sovereign, bearer instrument, store of value found that their networks crashed to be 1% of what Bitcoin is. So now we‚Äôre sitting at a point where all those risks are out of the way. I would say that year one of institutional adoption started August 2020: that‚Äôs when Microstrategy bought $250 million dollars worth of Bitcoin and we put that out on the wire. We were the first publicly-traded company to actually buy Bitcoin. I don‚Äôt think you could have found a $5 million dollar purchase from a public company before we did that. So that was kind of like a gun going off. And then in the next 12 months, Tesla bought Bitcoin, Square bought Bitcoin. And I‚Äôd say now we‚Äôre in year two of institutional adoption. And there should be 24 publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by the end of this quarter, so you‚Äôre looking at 36 publicly-traded companies, and you‚Äôve got in a range of $50 billion dollars of Bitcoin on the balance sheet of publicly-traded companies, and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap of Bitcoin-exposed companies. So I would say the asset ‚Äî decade one was entrepreneurial, experimental. Decade two is a rotation from entrepreneurs to institutions, and is becoming institutionalized. So maybe decade one you go from zero to a trillion, and in decade two you go from one trillion to a hundred trillion. Lex Fridman: What about government adoption? You said institutional adoption. Are governments important in this? Maybe some governments incorporating it as a currency into their banks, all that kind of stuff. Is that important? And if it is, when will it happen? Michael Saylor [timestamp 2:52:43]: It‚Äôs not essential for the success of the asset class, but I think it‚Äôs inevitable in various degrees over time. But the most likely thing to happen next is large acquisitions by institutional investors of Bitcoin as a digital gold, where they‚Äôre just swapping out gold for digital gold and thinking of it like that. And the government entities most likely to be involved with that would be sovereign wealth funds. If you look at all the sovereign wealth funds that are holding big tech stock, equities ‚Äî the Swiss, the Norwegians, the Middle Easterners ‚Äî if you can hold big tech, then holding digital gold would be not far removed from that. That‚Äôs a non-controversial adoption. I think there are opportunities for governments that are much more profound: if a government started to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, that‚Äôs much bigger than just an asset investment ‚Äî that‚Äôs 100x bigger. And you could imagine that‚Äôs like a trillion dollar opportunity. Like, any government that wanted to adopt it as a treasury reserve asset would probably generate trillions of dollars ‚Äî a trillion or more of value. And then the thing that people think about is: Well, will oil ever be priced in Bitcoin? Or any other export commodity? I think there‚Äôs like $1.8 trillion dollars or more of export commodities in the world, and right now they‚Äôre all priced in dollars. I think that this is a colorful thing, but it‚Äôs not really that relevant. Like, you could sell all that stuff in dollars. The relevant decision that any institution makes, whether they‚Äôre a non-profit, a university, a corporation, or a government, is: What‚Äôs your treasury reserve asset? And if your treasury reserve asset is the peso, and if the peso‚Äôs losing 20%-30% of its value a year, then your balance sheet is collapsing within 5 years. And if the treasury reserve asset is dollars and currency derivatives and US treasuries, then right now it‚Äôs probably 15% or more monetary inflation ‚Äî we‚Äôre running double the historic average, you could argue triple ‚Äî somewhere between double and triple depending upon what your metric is. So do I think it‚Äôll happen? I think that they‚Äôre conservative, but they have to be shocked, and I think there is a shock. The late Russian sanctions are a big shock. When the West sees $350 billion dollars worth of Russian gold and currency derivatives, I think you‚Äôve got the famous quote by Putin that, We have to rethink our treasury strategies, and that pushes everybody toward a commodity strategy. What commodities do I want to hold? I think that‚Äôs got a lot of people thinking. I think it‚Äôs got the Chinese thinking. Everybody wants to be the reserve currency, right? So if I buy $50 billion dollars worth of dollars every year then I buy $500 billion over a decade and I probably pay $250 billion dollars of inflation cost on the backs of my citizens in a decade. Lex Fridman: So inflation could be one of the sources of shock. And you wonder if there is a switch to Bitcoin, whether it would be a bang or a whimper. Like, what is the nature of the shock? Or the transition? Michael Saylor: I think that the year 2022 is pretty catalytic for digital assets in general, and for for Bitcoin in particular. The Canadian trucker crisis I think educated hundreds of millions of people and made them start questioning their property rights and their banks. I think the Ukraine war was a second shock, but I think that the Russian sanctions was a third shock. I think all three ‚Äî and I think hyperinflation in the rest of the world is a fourth shock, and then persistent inflation in the US is a fifth shock. So I think it‚Äôs a perfect storm, and if you put all these events together, what do they signify? They signify ‚Äî the rational conclusion for any person thinking about this ‚Äî is: I‚Äôm not sure if I can trust my property. I don‚Äôt know if I have property rights. I don‚Äôt know if I can trust the bank. And if I‚Äôm politically at odds with the leader of my own country, I‚Äôm going to lose my property. And if I‚Äôm politically at odds with the owner of another country, I‚Äôm still going to lose my property. And when push comes to shove, the banks will freeze my assets and seize them. And I think that that is playing out in front of everybody in the world, such that your logical response would be: I‚Äôm going to convert my weak currency to a strong currency. Like, I‚Äôll convert my peso and lira to the dollar. I‚Äôm going to convert my weak property to strong property: I‚Äôm going to sell my building downtown in Moscow and very rather own a building in New York City. I‚Äôd rather own in a powerful nation than be stuck with a building in Nigeria or a building in Argentina or whatever. So I‚Äôm going to sell my weak properties and buy strong properties. I‚Äôm going to convert my physical assets to digital assets. I‚Äôd rather own a digital building than own a physical building, because if I had a billion dollar building in Moscow, who can I rent that to? But if I have a billion dollar digital building, I can rent it to anybody in any city in the world ‚Äî anybody with money. And the maintenance cost is almost nothing, and I can hold it for a hundred years. So it‚Äôs indestructible building. And then finally, I want to move from having my assets in a bank with a counterparty to self-custody assets. And this is not just Ukraine, but this is like the story in Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South America ‚Äî you don‚Äôt really want to be sitting with $10 million dollars in a bank in Istanbul. The bank‚Äôs gonna freeze your money, convert it to lira, devalue the lira, and then feed it back to you over 17 years, right? Lex Fridman: So, self-custody assets would be layer one Bitcoin? Michael Saylor: Self-custody assets is like if I got my own hardware wallet and I‚Äôve either got ‚Äî your highest form of self-custody would be Bitcoin on your own hardware wallet or Bitcoin in your own self-custody, and the other thing people think about is how do I get crypto dollars like Tether, like some stablecoin. If you had a choice, would you rather have your money in a bank in a war zone in dollars, or have your money in a stablecoin on your mobile phone in dollars? You‚Äôd take the latter risk rather than the former risk. Lex Fridman: In a war zone, definitely, yeah. Michael Saylor: And you can see that happening. Like, we‚Äôve gone from $5 billion in stablecoins to $200 billion in the last 24 months. So I do think there‚Äôs massive demand for crypto dollars in the form of a US dollar asset. And everybody in the world would say, Yeah, I want that. Well, unless you‚Äôre just an extreme patriot. But most people would say, I want that. And then a lesser group of people would say, I think I want to be able to carry my property in the palm of my hand so I have self-custody of it. Lex Fridman: So the Bitcoin price has gone through quite a roller coaster ‚Äî what do you think is the high point it‚Äôs going to hit? Michael Saylor: I think it‚Äôll go up forever. I mean, I think Bitcoin is going to climb in a serpentine fashion. It‚Äôs going to advance and come back and it‚Äôs going to keep climbing. I think that the volatility attracts all of the capital into the marketplace, and so the volatility makes it the most interesting thing in the financial universe. It also generates massive yield and massive returns for traders, and that attracts capital. Like, we‚Äôre talking about the difference between a 5% return and 500% return. So the fast money is attracted by the volatility. The volatility‚Äôs been decreasing year-by-year-by-year ‚Äî I think that that it‚Äôs stabilizing. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see as much volatility in the future as we have in the past. I think that if we look at Bitcoin and model it as digital gold, the market cap goes to between $10-$20 trillion. But remember: gold is defective property. Gold is dead money. You have a billion dollars of gold that stays in a vault for a decade ‚Äî it‚Äôs very hard to mortgage the gold. It‚Äôs also very hard to rent the gold. You can‚Äôt loan the gold. No one‚Äôs going to create a business with your gold. So gold doesn‚Äôt generate much of a yield, so for that reason, most people wouldn‚Äôt store a billion dollars for a decade in gold. They would buy a billion dollars of commercial real estate property. And the reason why is because I can rent it and generate a yield on it that‚Äôs in excess of the maintenance cost. So if you consider digital property that‚Äôs a $100-$200 trillion dollar addressable market, so I would think it goes from $10 trillion to $100 trillion as people start to think of it as digital property. Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:03:08]: What does that mean in terms of price per per coin? Michael Saylor: At $500,000, that‚Äôs a $10 trillion dollar asset. At $5 million, that‚Äôs a $100 trillion dollar asset. Lex Fridman: So you think it crosses a million ‚Äî it can go even higher? Michael Saylor: Yeah I think it keeps going up forever. I mean, there‚Äôs no reason we couldn‚Äôt go to $10 million a coin, because digital property isn‚Äôt the highest form, right? Gold was that low frequency money. Property is a mid-frequency money. But when I start to program it faster, it starts to look like digital energy. And then it doesn‚Äôt just replace property ‚Äî then you‚Äôre starting to replace bonds. It‚Äôs $100 trillion in bonds. There‚Äôs $50-$100 trillion in other currency derivatives. And these are all conventional use cases. I think that there‚Äôs $350-$500 trillion dollars worth of currency, currency derivatives in the world. And when I say that, I mean things that are valued based upon fiat cash flows: any commercial real estate, any bond, any sovereign debt, any currency itself, any derivatives to those things ‚Äî they‚Äôre all derivatives. And they‚Äôre all defective. And they‚Äôre all defective because of this persistent 7%-14% lapse which we call inflation or monetary expansion. Can we switch subjects to talk about the energy side of it? Like, the innovative piece? Let‚Äôs just start with this idea that I‚Äôve got a hotel worth a billion dollars with a thousand rooms: when it becomes a dematerialized hotel ‚Äî Lex Fridman: I love that word so much by the way: dematerialized hotel. Michael Saylor: We‚Äôre across from the Fontainebleau here: imagine the Fontainebleau is dematerialized. The problem with the physical hotel is I got to hire real people moving subject to the speed of sound and physics laws and Newton‚Äôs laws and I can rent it to people in Miami Beach. But if it was a digital hotel, I could rent the room to people in Paris, London, and New York every night, and I can run it with robots. And as soon as I do that, I can rent it by the room-hour and I can rent it by the room-minute, and so I start to chop my hotel up into 100,000 room-hours that I sell to the highest bidder anywhere in the world. And you can see all of a sudden, the yield, the rent, and the income of the property is dramatically increased. I can also see the maintenance cost of the property falls. I get on Moore‚Äôs law and I‚Äôm operating in cyberspace. So I got rid of Newton‚Äôs laws ‚Äî I got rid of all the friction and all those problems ‚Äî I tapped into the benefits of cyberspace. I created a global property. I started monetizing it at different frequencies. And of course now I can mortgage it to anybody in the world. I mean, you‚Äôre not going to be able to get a mortgage on a Turkish building from someone in South Africa ‚Äî you have to have to find someone that‚Äôs local to the culture you‚Äôre in. So when you start to move from analog property to digital property, it‚Äôs not just a little bit better, it‚Äôs a lot better. And what I just described, Lex, is like the DeFi vision: it‚Äôs the beauty of DeFi flash loans, money moving at high velocity. At some point, if the hotel is dematerialized, then what‚Äôs the difference between renting a hotel room and loaning a block of stock, right? I‚Äôm just finding the highest, best use of the thing. Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:07:05]: It feels like the magic really emerges though when you build a market of layer two and layer three technologies on top of that. Maybe you can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but for all these hotels and all these kinds of ideas, it‚Äôs always touching humans at some point and the consumers or humans or business owners and so on, so the interface ‚Äî you have to create services that make all that super-efficient, super-fun to use, pleasant, effective, all those kinds of things. So you have to build a whole economy on top of that. Michael Saylor: Yeah I happen to think that won‚Äôt be done by the crypto industry at all ‚Äî I think that‚Äôll be done by centralized applications. I think it‚Äôll be the citadels of the world, the high-speed traders of the world, the New Yorkers. I think it‚Äôll be Binance, FTX, and Coinbase as a layer three exchange that will give you the yield and will give you the loan and the best terms. Because ultimately you have to jump through these compliance hoops. Like, BlockFi can give you yield, but they have to do it in compliant way with the United States jurisdiction. So ultimately those applications ‚Äî to use that digital property and either give you a loan on it or give you yield on it ‚Äî are going to come from companies. But the fundamental difference is: it could be companies anywhere in the world. So if a company in Singapore comes up with a better offering then the capital is going to start to flow to Singapore. I can‚Äôt send 10 city blocks of LA to Singapore to rent during a festival, but I can send 10 blocks of Bitcoin to Singapore. So you‚Äôve got a truly global market that‚Äôs functioning in this asset. And it‚Äôs a second-order asset. For example: maybe you‚Äôre an American citizen and you own 10 Bitcoin and someone in Singapore will generate 27% yield on the Bitcoin, but legally you can‚Äôt send the Bitcoin to them ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter, because the fact that exists means that someone in Hong Kong will borrow the 10 Bitcoin from somebody in New York and then they will put on the trade in Singapore and that will create a demand for Bitcoin which will drive up the price of Bitcoin which will result in an effective tax-free yield for the person in the US that‚Äôs not even in the jurisdiction. So there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs going on in Singapore to drive up the price of your land in LA, but there is something going on everywhere in the world to drive up the price of property in cyberspace, if there‚Äôs only one digital Manhattan. And so there‚Äôs a dynamic there which is profound because it‚Äôs global. But now let‚Äôs go to the next extreme. I‚Äôm still giving you a fairly conventional idea which is: let‚Äôs just loan the money fast on a global network, and let‚Äôs just rent the hotel room fast in cyberspace. But let‚Äôs move to maybe a more innovative idea: the first generation of Internet brought a lot of productivity, but there‚Äôs also just a lot of flaws in it. For example: Twitter is full of garbage. Instagram DMs are full of garbage. Your Twitter DMs are full of garbage. YouTube is full of scams. Every 15 minutes there‚Äôs a Michael Sayler Bitcoin giveaway spun up on YouTube. My Office 365 inbox is full of garbage. Millions of spam messages. I‚Äôm running four different e-mail filters. My company spends a million dollars a year to fight denial of service attacks and all sorts of other security things. There are denial of service attacks everywhere against everybody in cyberspace all the time ‚Äî it‚Äôs extreme. And we‚Äôre all beset with hostility, right? You‚Äôve been a victim of it on Twitter. You go on Twitter and people post stuff they would never say to your face. And then if you look you find out that the account was created like three days ago and it‚Äôs not even a real person. So we‚Äôre beset with phishing attacks and scams and spam bots and garbage. Why? And the answer is because the first generation of Internet was digital information and there was no energy. There‚Äôs no conservation of energy in cyberspace. The thing that makes the universe work is conservation of energy. If I went to a hotel room, I‚Äôd have to post a credit card. And then if I smashed the place up, there‚Äôd be economic consequences, maybe there would be criminal consequences, there might be reputational consequences. A lamp might fall on me. But in the worst case, I can only smash up one hotel room. Now imagine I could actually write a Python script to send myself to every hotel room in the world every minute, not post a credit card, and smash them all up anonymously. The thing that makes the universe work is friction: speed of sound, speed of light, and the fact that ultimately it‚Äôs conservative. You‚Äôre either energy or you‚Äôre matter, but once you‚Äôve used the energy it‚Äôs gone, and you can‚Äôt do infinite everything ‚Äî that‚Äôs missing in cyberspace right now. And if you look at all of the moral hazards and all of the product defects that we have in all of these products, most of them ‚Äî 99% of them ‚Äî could be cured if we introduced conservation of energy into cyberspace. And that‚Äôs what you can do with high-speed digital property ‚Äî high-speed Bitcoin. And by high-speed I mean, not 20 transactions a day, I mean 20,000 transactions a day. So how do you do that? Well, I let everybody on Twitter post a 1,000 or 10,000 satoshis via a Lightning wallet ‚Äî a Lightning badge. Give me an orange check. If you put up $20 bucks once in your life, you could give 300 million people an orange check. Right now you don‚Äôt have a blue check, Lex. You‚Äôre a famous person ‚Äî I don‚Äôt know why you don‚Äôt have a blue check. Have you ever applied for a blue check? Lex Fridman: No. Michael Saylor: There are 360,000 people on Twitter with a blue check. There are 300 million people on Twitter. So the conventional way to verify accounts is elitist, archaic. Lex Fridman: Yeah, how does it work? How did you get a blue check? Michael Saylor: You‚Äôve got to apply and wait six months and you have to post like three articles in the public mainstream media that illustrates you‚Äôre a person of interest. Lex Fridman: Interesting. Michael Saylor: Generally they would grant them to CEOs of public companies or ‚Äî the whole idea is to verify that you are who you say you are. But the question is: why isn‚Äôt everybody verified? And there‚Äôs a couple of threads on that. One is: some people don‚Äôt want to be doxxed. They want to be anonymous. But there are even anonymous people that should be verified, because otherwise you‚Äôre subjecting their entire following to phishing attacks and scams and hostility. Lex Fridman: What‚Äôs the orange verification? Can you actually elaborate a little bit more? If you put up $20 bucks? Michael Saylor [timestamp 3:14:57]: Yeah I think everybody on Twitter ought to be able to get an orange check if they could come up with like $10. Lex Fridman: And what is the power of that orange check? What what does that verify exactly? Michael Saylor: You basically post a security deposit for your safe passage through cyberspace. So the way it would work is: if you‚Äôve got $10 once in your life, you can basically show that you‚Äôre credit-worthy, and that‚Äôs your pledge to me that you‚Äôre going to act responsibly. So you put the $10 or the $20 into the Lightning wallet, you get an orange check, then Twitter just gives you a setting where I can say, the only people that could DM me are orange checks, the only people that can post on my Tweets are orange checks. So instead of locking out the public and just letting your followers comment, you lock out all the unverified, and that means people that don‚Äôt want to post a $10 security deposit can‚Äôt comment. Once you‚Äôve done those two things, then you‚Äôre in position to monetize malice, right? Monetize motion or malice, for that matter. But let‚Äôs just say for the sake of argument you post something and 9,700 bots spin up and pitch their whatever scam. Right now you sit and you go, Report, Report, Report, Report, Report, Report. And if you spend an hour, you get through half of them ‚Äî you waste an hour of your life ‚Äî they just spent up another 97 gazillion because they‚Äôve got a Python script spinning it up, so it‚Äôs hopeless. But on the other hand, if you report them and they really are a bot, Twitter‚Äôs got a method to actually delete the account ‚Äî they know that they‚Äôre bots. The problem is not they don‚Äôt know how to delete the account ‚Äî the problem is there are no consequences when they delete the account. So if there are consequences, Twitter could just seize the $10 or seize the $20 because it‚Äôs a bot. It‚Äôs a malicious, criminal act or whatever ‚Äî it is a violation of the platform rules. You end up seizing $10,000 ‚Äî give half the money to the reporter and half the money to the Twitter platform. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs a really powerful idea but that‚Äôs adding friction akin to the kind of friction you have in the physical world. You have real consequences. Conservation of energy. Michael Saylor: There‚Äôs no friction, there‚Äôs no nothing on this Earth, right? I mean, you can‚Äôt walk across the room without friction. Friction is not bad ‚Äî unnecessary friction is bad. So in this particular case, you‚Äôre introducing conservation of energy. And in essence you‚Äôre introducing the concept of consequence or truth into cyberspace. And that means: if you do want to spin up 10 million fakes Lex Fridmans, it‚Äôs going to cost you $100 million dollars to spin up 10 million fake Lexs. Lex Fridman: But the thing is, you could do that with the dollar, but in your case you‚Äôre saying that it‚Äôs more tied to physical reality when you do that with Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: Yeah, well let‚Äôs follow up on that idea a bit more: if you did do it with the dollar, then the question is, How do 6 billion people deposit the dollars? Because what you‚Äôre doing is ‚Äî could you do it with a credit card? Like, how do you send dollars? Well, you have to dox yourself. Like, it‚Äôs not easy. So you‚Äôre talking about inputting a credit card transaction, doxing yourself, and now you‚Äôve just eliminated the 2 billion people that don‚Äôt have credit cards or don‚Äôt have banks. You‚Äôve also got a problem with everybody that wants to remain anonymous. But you‚Äôve also got this other problem which is: credit credit cards are expensive transactions, low frequency, slow settlement. So do you really want to pay 2.5% every time you actually show a $20 deposit? And maybe you could do a kludgy version of this for a subset of people ‚Äî it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs 10% as good if you did it with conventional payment rails. But what you can‚Äôt do is the next idea, which is: I want the orange badge to be used to give me safe passage through cyberspace tripping across every platform. So how do I solve the denial of service attacks against a website? I publish a website ‚Äî you hit it with a million requests. Now how do I deal with that? Well I can lock you out and I can make it a zero-trust website and then you have to be coming at me through a trusted firewall with a trusted credential, but that‚Äôs a pretty draconian thing. Or, I could put it behind a Lightning wall. A Lightning wall would be: I just challenge you Lex ‚Äî you want to browse my website, you have to show me your 100,000 satoshis. Do you have 100,000 satoshis? Click, Okay. Now you click away a hundred times or a thousand times, and after a thousand times I‚Äôm like, Well now Lex you‚Äôre getting offensive. I‚Äôm gonna take a satoshi from you, or 10 satoshis ‚Äî a microtransaction. You want to hit me a million times? I‚Äôm taking all your satoshis and locking you out. What you want to do is you want to go through 200 websites a day and every time you cross a domain you need to be able to in a split second prove that you‚Äôve got some asset. And now when you cross back, when you exit domain, you want to fetch your asset back. So how do I, in a friction-free fashion, browse through dozens or hundreds of websites, post a security deposit for safe passage, and then get it back? You couldn‚Äôt afford to pay a credit card fee each time. When you think about 2.5% as a transaction fee, it means you trade the money 40 times and it‚Äôs gone! It‚Äôs gone. Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:21:15]: So you can‚Äôt do this kind of hopping around through the Internet with this kind of verification that grounds you to a physical reality. It‚Äôs a really, really interesting idea. Why hasn‚Äôt that been done? Michael Saylor: I think you need two things: you need an idea like a digital asset like Bitcoin that‚Äôs a bearer instrument for final settlement, and then you need a high-speed transaction network like Lightning where the transaction cost might be a 20th of a penny or less. And if you roll the clock back 24 months, I don‚Äôt think you had the Lightning Network in a stable point. It‚Äôs really just the past 12 months. It‚Äôs an idea you could think about this year, and I think you need to be aware of Bitcoin as something other than like a scary speculative asset. So I really think we‚Äôre just at the beginning. Lex Fridman: The embryonic stage. I have to ask: Michael Saylor, you said before, There‚Äôs no second best to Bitcoin. What would be the second best? Traditionally there‚Äôs Ethereum with smart contracts, Cardano with proof-of-stake, Polkadot with interoperability between blockchains, Dogecoin has the incredible power of the meme, privacy with Monero ‚Äî I just can keep going. There‚Äôs of course after the block size wars the different offshoots of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor: I think if you decompose or segment the crypto market, you‚Äôve got crypto property ‚Äî Bitcoin is the king of that, and other Bitcoin forks that want to be an a bearer instrument store of value would be a property, a Bitcoin Cash or a Litecoin, something like that ‚Äî then you‚Äôve got cryptocurrencies. I don‚Äôt think Bitcoin‚Äôs a currency, because a currency I define in nation state sense: a currency is an a digital asset that you can transfer in a transaction without incurring a taxable obligation. So that means it has to be a stable dollar or a stable euro or a stable yen ‚Äî a stablecoin. So I think you‚Äôve got cryptocurrencies ‚Äî Tether, Circle most famous ‚Äî then you‚Äôve got crypto platforms, and Ethereum is the most famous of the crypto platforms. The platform with smart contract functionality, etc. And then I think you‚Äôve got just crypto securities ‚Äî it‚Äôs just like my favorite whatever meme coin and I love it because I love it and it‚Äôs attached to my game or my company or my persona or my whatever. I think if pushed me and said, Well what‚Äôs the second best? I would say the world wants two things: it wants crypto property as a savings account and it wants cryptocurrency as a checking account. And that means that the most popular thing really is going to be a stablecoin dollar. And there‚Äôs maybe a fight right now ‚Äî it might be Tether. But a stable dollar ‚Äî it‚Äôs not clear that there‚Äôll be one that will win. The class of stable dollars is probably a $1-$10 trillion dollar market, easily. I think that in the crypto platform space, Ethereum will compete with Solana and Binance smart chain and the like. Lex Fridman: Are there certain characteristics of any of them that kind of stand out to you? Or don‚Äôt you think the competition is based on a set of features? Also ‚Äî the set of features that the cryptocurrency provides ‚Äî but also the community that it provides. Don‚Äôt you think the community matters and sort of the adoption, the dynamic of the adoption both across the developers and the Internet? Michael Saylor: If I‚Äôm looking at them, I mean the first question is: What‚Äôs the regulatory risk? How likely is it to be deemed a property versus a security? And the second is: What‚Äôs the competitive risk? And the third is: What‚Äôs the speed and the performance? And the all of those things lead to the question of: What‚Äôs the security risk? How likely is it to crash and burn? And how stable or unstable is it? And then there‚Äôs the marketing risk. I mean, there are different teams behind each of these things and communities behind them. I think that the big cloud looming over the crypto industry is regulatory treatment of cryptocurrencies and regulatory treatment of crypto securities and crypto platforms. And I think that won‚Äôt be determined until the end of the first Biden administration. For example, there are people that would like only US FDIC-insured banks to issue cryptocurrencies. They want J.P. Morgan to issue a crypto dollar backed one-to-one. But then in the US right now we have Circle and we have other companies that are licensed entities that are backed by cash and cash equivalents, but they‚Äôre not FDIC-insured banks. There‚Äôs also a debate in Congress about whether state-chartered banks should be able to issue these things. And then we have Tether and others that are outside of the US jurisdiction, they‚Äôre probably not backed by cash and cash equivalents ‚Äî they‚Äôre backed by stuff, and we don‚Äôt know what stuff. And then finally you have UST and DAI which are algorithmic stablecoins that are even more innovative further outside the compliance framework. So if you ask who‚Äôs going to win, the question is really: Will the market decide? Or will the regulators decide? If the regulators get out of the way and the market fought it out, well then it‚Äôs an interesting discussion. And then I think that all bets are off if the regulators get more heavy-handed with this. And I think you could have the same discussion with crypto properties. Like, the DeFi exchanges and the crypto exchanges, the SEC would like to regulate the crypto exchanges, they‚Äôd like to regulate the DeFi exchanges. That means they may regulate the crypto platforms, and at what rate? And in what fashion? And so I think that I could give you an opinion if it was limited to competition under the current regulatory regime, but I think that the regulations are so fast-moving and it‚Äôs so uncertain that you can‚Äôt make a decision without considering the potential actions of the regulators. Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:27:55]: I hope the regulators get out of the way. Can you steelman the case that Dogecoin is I guess the second best cryptocurrency? Or if you don‚Äôt consider Bitcoin a cryptocurrency but instead as crypto property ‚Äî Michael Saylor: I would classify it as crypto property because the US dollar is a currency, so unless your crypto-asset is pegged algorithmically or stably to the value of the dollar, it‚Äôs not a currency ‚Äî it‚Äôs a property or it‚Äôs an asset. Lex Fridman: So then can you steelman the case that Dogecoin is the best cryptocurrency then, because Bitcoin is not even in that list? Michael Saylor: The debate is going to be whether it‚Äôs property or a security, and there‚Äôs a debate whether it‚Äôs decentralized enough. So let‚Äôs assume it was decentralized ‚Äî well it‚Äôs increasing at what, 5% a year inflation rate? But it‚Äôs not 5% exponentially, it‚Äôs like a plus 5 million something capped at less ‚Äî I forget the exact number, but it‚Äôs an inflationary property. It‚Äôs got a lower inflation rate than the US dollar and it‚Äôs got a much lower inflation rate than many other fiat currencies, so I think you could say that. Lex Fridman: But don‚Äôt you see the power of meme? The power of ideas? The power of fun or whatever mechanism is used to captivate a community? Michael Saylor: I do, but there are meme stocks ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt absolve you of your ethical and securities liabilities if you‚Äôre promoting it. So I don‚Äôt have a problem with people buying a stock. It‚Äôs just, the way I divide the world is: there‚Äôs investment, there‚Äôs saving, there‚Äôs speculation, and there‚Äôs trading. So Bitcoin is an asset for saving ‚Äî if you want to save money for 100 years, you don‚Äôt really want to take on execution risk or the like. So you‚Äôre just buying something to hold forever. For you to actually endorse something as a property ‚Äî like if you said to me, Mike, what should I buy for the next hundred years? I‚Äôd say, Well, some amount of real estate, some amount of scarce collectibles, some amount of Bitcoin. You can run your company ‚Äî but running your company is an investment. So the savings are properties. If you said, What should I invest in? I‚Äôd say, Well here‚Äôs a list of good companies. Private companies ‚Äî you can start your own company ‚Äî that‚Äôs an investment. If you said, What should I trade? Well trading is like a proprietary thing ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have any special insight into that. If you‚Äôre a good trader, you know you are. If you said to me, What should you speculate in? We talk about meme stocks and meme coins, and it kind of sits up there right in the same space with what horse should you bet on and what sports team should you gamble on and should you bet on black six times in a row and double down each time? I mean it‚Äôs fun, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a speculation, right? You can‚Äôt build a civilization ‚Äî Lex Fridman: On speculation. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not an institutional asset. And in fact, where I‚Äôd leave it is: Bitcoin is clearly digital property, which makes it an institutional-grade investable asset for a public company, a public figure, a public investor, or anybody that‚Äôs risk-adverse. I think that the other the Top-100 other cryptos are like venture capital investments. And if you‚Äôre a VC and if you‚Äôre a qualified technical investor and you have a pool of capital and you can take that kind of risk, then you can parse through that and form opinions. It‚Äôs just orders of magnitude more risky because of competition, because of ambition, and because of regulation. And if you take the meme coins, it‚Äôs like when some rapper comes out with a meme coin it‚Äôs like maybe it‚Äôll peak when I hear about it. I mean, SHIB was created as a coin such that it had so many zeros after the decimal point that when you looked at it on the exchanges it always showed zero zero zero zero and it wasn‚Äôt until like six months after it got popular that they started expanding the display so you could see whether the price had changed. Lex Fridman: That‚Äôs speculation. Maybe you can correct me, but you‚Äôve been critical of Elon Musk in the past in the crypto space. Where do you stand on Elon‚Äôs effect on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general these days? Michael Saylor [timestamp 3:32:42]: I believe that Bitcoin is a massive breakthrough for the human race that will cure half the problems in the world and generate hundreds of trillions of dollars of economic value to the civilization. And I believe that it‚Äôs an early stage where many people don‚Äôt understand it and they‚Äôre afraid of it and there‚Äôs FUD and there‚Äôs uncertainty there‚Äôs doubt and there‚Äôs fear and there‚Äôs a very noisy crypto world and there‚Äôs 15,000 other cryptos that are are seeking relevance and I think most of the FUD is actually fueled by the other crypto entrepreneurs. So the environmental FUD and the other types of uncertainty that surround Bitcoin ‚Äî generally, they‚Äôre not coming from legitimate environmentalists, they don‚Äôt come from legitimate critics. They actually are guerrilla marketing campaigns that are being financed and fueled by other crypto entrepreneurs because they have an interest in doing so. So if I look at a constructive path forward: first I think it‚Äôd be very constructive for corporations to embrace Bitcoin and build applications on top of it. You don‚Äôt need to fix it ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. Like, when you put it on a layer two and a layer three it moves a billion times a second at the speed of light, so every beautiful, cool DeFi application, every crypto application, everything you could imagine you might want to do, you can do with a legitimate company and a legitimate website or mobile application sitting on top of Bitcoin or Lightning if you want to. So I think that to the extent that people do that, that‚Äôs going to be better for the world. If you consider what holds people back, I think it‚Äôs just misperceptions about what Bitcoin is. So I‚Äôm a big fan of just educating people. If you‚Äôre not going to commercialize it, then just educate people on what it is. So for example: Bitcoin‚Äôs the most efficient use of energy in the world, by far. Most people don‚Äôt necessarily perceive that or realize that, but if you were to take any metric ‚Äî energy intensity ‚Äî you put like $2 billion dollars worth of electricity in the network every year and it‚Äôs worth $850 billion dollars. There is no industry in the real world right that is that energy-efficient. Not only that energy-efficient, it‚Äôs also the most sustainable industry. We do surveys: 58% of Bitcoin mining energy is sustainable. So there‚Äôs a very good story. In fact every other industry ‚Äî planes, trains, automobiles, construction, food, medicine, everything else ‚Äî it‚Äôs less clean, less efficient. So I wouldn‚Äôt say there is a debate, I would just say that to the extent that the Bitcoin community had any issue with Elon, it was just this environmental uncertainty that he fueled in a couple of his tweets, which I think just is very distracting. Lex Fridman: Well that was one of them, but I think it‚Äôs like the Bitcoin maximalists, but generally the crypto community ‚Äî what you call the crypto entrepreneurs ‚Äî it‚Äôs also they‚Äôre using it for investment, for speculation, and therefore get very passionate about celebrities, including you, like famous people, saying positive stuff about any one particular crypto thing you can buy on Coinbase. And so they might be unhappy with Elon Musk that he‚Äôs promoting Bitcoin and then not, and promoting Dogecoin and then not, and there‚Äôs so much emotion tied up in the communication on this topic. And I think that‚Äôs where a lot of the ‚Äî Michael Saylor: Look ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have a criticism of Elon Musk. He‚Äôs free to do whatever he wishes to do ‚Äî it‚Äôs his life. In fact, Elon Musk is the second-largest supporter of Bitcoin in the world. So I think that the Bitcoin community tends to eat its own quite a bit. It tends to be very self-critical. And instead of saying, Elon is more supportive of Bitcoin than the other 10,000 people in the world with serious amounts of money, they focus upon ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Yeah, this is strange. Eating your own is just ‚Äî Michael Saylor: So I mean I think he‚Äôs free to do what he wants to do, and I think he‚Äôs done a lot of good for Bitcoin in putting it on the balance sheet of Tesla and holding it, and I think that sent a very powerful message. Lex Fridman: Do you have advice for young people? So you‚Äôve had a heck of a life: you‚Äôve done quite a lot of things ‚Äî before MIT ‚Äî but starting with MIT. Is there advice you have for young people in high school and college? How to have a career they can be proud of? How to have a life they can be proud of? Michael Saylor: I was asked by somebody for quick advice for his young children ‚Äî he had twins ‚Äî when they enter adulthood. He said, Give me your advice for them in a letter ‚ÄîI‚Äôm going to give it to them when they turn 21 or something. So I was at a party and then he handed me this sheet of paper and I thought, Oh, he wants me to write it down right now. So I sat down I started writing and I figured, Well, what would you want to tell someone at age 21? Lex Fridman: You wrote it down? Awesome. Michael Saylor: I wrote it down and I tweeted it and it‚Äôs sitting on Twitter but I‚Äôll tell you what I said. I said ‚Äî my advice if you‚Äôre entering adulthood: focus your energy, guard your time, train your mind, train your body, think for yourself, curate your friends, curate your environment, keep your promises, stay cheerful and constructive, and upgrade the world. That was the ten. Lex Fridman: Upgrade the world ‚Äî that‚Äôs an interesting choice of words. Upgrade the world, upgrade the world ‚Äî Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs like an engineer‚Äôs dream. Lex Fridman: Yeah it‚Äôs very engineering-themed. Keep your promises, too ‚Äî that‚Äôs an interesting one. Michael Saylor: I think most people suffer because they just don‚Äôt focus. Like, you‚Äôve got to figure out ‚Äî I think the big risk in this world is there‚Äôs too much of everything. Like, you can sit and watch chess videos 100 hours a week and you‚Äôll never get through all the chess videos. There‚Äôs too much of every possible thing, too much of every good thing. So figuring out what you want to do ‚Äî and then everything will suck up your time, right? There‚Äôs a hundred streaming channels to binge watch. So you gotta guard your time and then train your body, train your mind, and control who‚Äôs around you, control what surrounds you. So ultimately, in a world where there‚Äôs too much of everything ‚Äî Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs like those laser eyes. It‚Äôs like those laser eyes ‚Äî you have to focus on just a few of those things. Michael Saylor: Yeah I mean I‚Äôve got a thousand opinions we could talk about and I could pursue a thousand things, but I don‚Äôt expect to be successful, and I‚Äôm not sure that my opinion in any of the 999 is any more valid than the leader of thought in that area, so how about if I just focus upon one thing and then deliver the best I can in the one thing ‚Äî that‚Äôs the laser eye message. The rest get you distracted. Lex Fridman: Well how do you achieve that? Do you find yourself, given where you are in life, having to say No a lot? Or just focus comes naturally when you just ignore everything around you? So how do you achieve that focus? Michael Saylor: I think it helps if people know what you‚Äôre focused on. Lex Fridman: So everything about you just radiates that people know ‚Äî people know this is ‚Äî Michael Saylor: If they know what you‚Äôre focused on, then you won‚Äôt get so many other things coming your way. If you dally or if you flirt with 27 different things, then you‚Äôre going to get approached by people in each of the 27 communities, right? Lex Fridman: You mentioned getting a PhD ‚Äî and given your roots at MIT ‚Äî there‚Äôs all kinds of journeys you can take to educate yourself. Do you think a PhD or school is still worth it? Or are there other paths through life? Michael Saylor: Is it worth it if you have to pay for it or is it worth it to spend the time on it? Lex Fridman: The time and the money is a big cost. Time probably the bigger one, right? Michael Saylor: I think it seems clear to me that the world wants more specialists. It wants you to be an expert in and to focus in on one area, and it‚Äôs punishing generalist jack-of-all-trades, but especially people that are generalists in the physical realm. Because if you‚Äôre a specialist in the digital realm, you‚Äôre the person with 700,000 followers on Twitter and you show them how to tie knots, or you‚Äôre the banjo player with 1.8 million followers and when everybody types banjo ‚Äî it‚Äôs you. And so the world wants people that do something well, and then it wants to stamp out 18 million copies of them. And so that argues in favor of focus. I mean, the definition of a PhD is someone with enough of an education that they‚Äôre capable of or have made ‚Äî I guess to get a PhD, technically you have to have done a dissertation where you made a seminal contribution to the body of human knowledge. And if you haven‚Äôt done that, technically you have a master‚Äôs degree but you‚Äôre not a doctor. So if you‚Äôre interested in any of the academic disciplines that a PhD would be granted for, then I can see that being a reasonable pursuit. But there are many people that are specialists ‚Äî you know the Agadmator on YouTube? Lex Fridman: Yeah yeah yeah. Michael Saylor: He‚Äôs the world‚Äôs greatest chess commentator. And I‚Äôve watched his career and he‚Äôs got progressively better ‚Äî and he‚Äôs really good! Lex Fridman: He‚Äôs going to love hearing this. Michael Saylor: Yeah if the Agadmator ever hears this: I‚Äôm a big fan of the Adadmator. I have to cut myself off because otherwise you‚Äôll watch the entire Paul Morphy saga for your weekend. But the point really is: YouTube is full of experts who are specialists in something, and they rise to the top of their profession. And Twitter is, too, and the Internet is. So I would advocate that you figure out what you‚Äôre passionate about and what you‚Äôre good at and you do focus on it ‚Äî especially if the thing that you‚Äôre doing can be automated, the problem is back to that 500,000 algebra teacher-type comment ‚Äî the problem is if it is possible to be automated, then over time someone‚Äôs probably going to automate it, and that squeezes the state space of everybody else. Like, after the lockdowns, it used to be there were like all these local bands that played in bars and everybody went to the bar to see the local band. And then during the lockdown you would have like these six super-groups and they would all get 500,000 or 1 million followers, and all these smaller local bands just got no attention at all. Lex Fridman [timestamp 3:45:49]: Well the interesting thing is: one of those 500,000 algebra teachers is likely to be part of the automation. So it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs an opportunity for you to think: where is my field, my discipline, evolving into? I talked to a bunch of librarians ‚Äî just happen to be friends with librarians ‚Äî and libraries will probably be evolving, and it‚Äôs up to you as a librarian to be one of the few that remain in the rubble. Michael Saylor: Yeah if you‚Äôre going to give commentary on Shakespeare plays, I want you to basically do it for every Shakespeare play. Like, I want you to be the Shakespeare dude. Just like ‚Äî Lex, you‚Äôre the deep-thinking podcaster, right? Or you‚Äôre the podcaster that goes after the deep intellectual conversations. And once I get comfortable with you and I like you, then I start binge watching Lex. But if you changed your format through 16 different formats so that you could compete with 16 different other personalities on YouTube, you probably wouldn‚Äôt beat any of them, right? You would probably just kind of sink into the #2 or #3 guy ‚Äî you‚Äôre not the #1 guy in the format. And I think the algorithm ‚Äî the Twitter algorithm and the YouTube algorithms ‚Äî they really reward the person that‚Äôs focused, on message, consistent. The world wants somebody they can trust that‚Äôs consistent and reliable, and they kind of want to know what they‚Äôre getting into, because ‚Äî and this is taken for granted, maybe ‚Äî but there‚Äôs 10 million people vying for every hour of your time, and so the fact that anybody gives you any time at all is a huge privilege, right? Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs amazing. Michael Saylor: And you should be thanking them, and you should respect their time. Lex Fridman: It‚Äôs interesting ‚Äî like, everything you said is very interesting, but of course from my perspective, and probably from your perspective, my actual life has nothing to do with it. It‚Äôs just being focused on stuff ‚Äî and in my case it‚Äôs focused on doing the thing I really enjoy doing and being myself and not caring about anything else. Like, I don‚Äôt care about views or likes or attention, and just maintaining that focus is the way. From an individual perspective, you live that life, but it does seem that the world and technology is rewarding the specialization and creating bigger and bigger platforms for the different specializations. And then that lifts all boats, actually, because the specializations get better and better and better at teaching people to do specific things, and they educate themselves, and it‚Äôs just everybody gets more and more knowledgeable and more and more empowered. Michael Saylor: The reward for authenticity more than offsets the specificity with which you pursue your mission. Another way to say it is: nobody wants to read advertising. If you were to spend $100 million dollars advertising your thing, I probably wouldn‚Äôt want to watch it. Lex Fridman: Yeah. That‚Äôs so fascinating. Michael Saylor: We see the death of that. And so the commercial shows are losing their audiences, and the authentic specialists or the authentic artists are gaining their audience. Lex Fridman: And that‚Äôs a beautiful thing. Speaking of deep thinking: you‚Äôre just a human. Your life ends. You‚Äôve accumulated so much wisdom, so much money, but the ride ends. Do you think about that? Do you ponder your death? Your mortality? Are you afraid of it? Michael Saylor: When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation, and the foundation‚Äôs mission is to make education free for everybody, forever. And if I‚Äôm able to contribute to the creation of a more perfect monetary system, then maybe that foundation will go on forever, right? Lex Fridman: The idea ‚Äî the foundation of the idea. So each of the foundations. Michael Saylor: It‚Äôs not clear we‚Äôre on the S-curve of immortal life yet ‚Äî like that‚Äôs a biological question and you ask that on some of your other interviews a lot. I think that we are on the threshold of immortal life for ideas, or immortal life for certain institutions or computer programs. So if we can fix the money, then you can create a technically perfected endowment. And then the question really is: what are your ideas? What do you want to leave behind? And so if it‚Äôs a park then you endow the park. If it‚Äôs free education then you endow that. If it‚Äôs some other ethical idea, right? Les Fridman: Does it make you sad that there‚Äôs something that you‚Äôve endowed, some very powerful idea of digital energy, that you help put it into the world, and that your mind ‚Äî your conscious mind ‚Äî will no longer be there to experience it? It‚Äôs just gone forever? Michael Saylor: I‚Äôd rather think that the thing that Satoshi taught us is: you should do your part during some phase of the journey and then you should get out of the way. And I think Steve Jobs said something similar to that effect in a very famous speech one day, which is: Death is a natural part of life and it makes way for the next generation. And I think the goal is: you upgrade the world, right? You leave it a better place, but you get out of the way. And I think when that breaks down, bad things happen. I think nature cleanses itself. There‚Äôs a cycle of life. Lex Fridman: And speaking of great people who did also get out of the way is George Washington ‚Äî so, hopefully, when you get out of the way, nobody‚Äôs bleeding you to death in hope of helping you. To do a bit of a callback: what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? What‚Äôs the meaning of life? Why are we here? We talked about the rise of human civilization ‚Äî it seems like we‚Äôre engineers at heart. We‚Äôll build cool stuff. Better and better use of energy ‚Äî channeling energy to be productive. Why? What‚Äôs it all for? Michael Saylor: You‚Äôre getting metaphysical on me. Lex Fridman: Very ‚Äî there‚Äôs a beautiful boat to the left of us: like, why do we do that? This boat that sailed the ocean. Then we build models of it to celebrate great engineering of the past. Michael Saylor: To engineer is divine. You can make lots of arguments as to why we‚Äôre here. We‚Äôre either here to entertain ourselves or we‚Äôre here to create something that‚Äôs beautiful, or something that‚Äôs functional. I think if you‚Äôre an engineer, you entertain yourself by creating something that‚Äôs both beautiful and functional. So I think all three of those things: it‚Äôs entertaining, but it‚Äôs ethical. You‚Äôve got to admire the first person that built a bridge ‚Äî crossing a chasm ‚Äî or the first person to work out the problem of how to get running water to a village, or the first person that figured out how to dam up a river, or mastered agriculture, or the guy that figured out how to grow fruit on trees or created orchards and maybe one day had like 10 fruit trees and he‚Äôs pretty proud of himself. Lex Fridman: So that‚Äôs functional. There is also something to that ‚Äî just like you said ‚Äî that it‚Äôs just beautiful. It does get you closer to, like you said, the divine. When you step back and look at the entirety of it ‚Äî a collective of humans using a beautiful invention or a creation or just something about this instrument is creating a beautiful piece of music ‚Äî that seems just right. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for. Whatever the divine is, it seems like we‚Äôre here for that. And I of course love talking to you because, from the engineering perspective, the functional is ultimately the mechanism towards the beauty. Michael Saylor: Isn‚Äôt there something beautiful about about making the world a better place for people that you love? Your friends, your family, or yourself? When you think about the entire arc of human existence and you roll the clock back 500,000 years and you think about every struggle of everyone that came before us and everything they had to overcome in order to put you here right now, you‚Äôve got to admire that. You‚Äôve got to respect that. Lex Fridman: That‚Äôs a heck of a gift they gave us. It‚Äôs also a heck of a responsibility. Don‚Äôt screw it up. Michael Saylor: If I dropped you 100,000 years ago and I said, Figure out steel refining. Or figure out silicon chips, fab reproduction, or whatever it is ‚Äî Lex Fridman: Or fire. Michael Saylor: And so now we‚Äôre here, and I guess the way you repay them is: you fix everything in front of your face you can. To someone like Elon, it means get us off the planet. To someone like me I think: fix the energy in the system. Lex Fridman: And that gives me hope. Michael, this is an incredible conversation. You‚Äôre an incredible human. It‚Äôs a huge honor you would sit down with me. Thank you so much for talking today. Michael Saylor: Yeah, thanks for having me, Lex. Distraction-free reading. No ads.

,,"Hey, Michael Saylor, I Have 1% of 1 Bitcoin...","$0.71 Let's be clear ..100% Michael Saylor will never read this post, because he is super busy promoting Bitcoin and managing a company. But, it would be cool to get a response from him! At any rate... I remember a while back Saylor talked about getting your hands on as much Bitcoin as you could before Wall Street and big companies, like BlackRock and the like, did. The reason was simple...a hedge against inflation. Protection of wealth and holding it is super important, as in the phrase, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. He talked about the poorest of people having just 1% of 1 Bitcoin would be a game changer. ""If you had just 1% of 1 Bitcoin, you would be better off than 90% of the population..."" (Not quoted exactly, but that was close to his words...) Well Michael Saylor, I have over 1% (about .04 Bitcoin) and at this exact moment, I don't feel 'better off'...and that is probably because I know Saylor himself has over 150,000 FULL Bitcoins...lol All joking aside, he has a great point. I am looking to continue gathering until I have at least .25 Bitcoin and that will be enough for me. Some of you will have more, but that is fine, because you will be in a great place later on. Thanks Saylor for helping me to see why Bitcoin is as important as it is, and hopefully you will continue doing all you can to get the masses into it before more gets lost in the big money machine...

investor, is acquiring more BTC amid the recent cryptocurrency market recovery. BTC $51,122 MicroStrategy co-founder and former CEO Michael Saylor took to Twitter on March 27 to announce that the firm has repaid its $205 million loan to Silvergate. Citing a form 8-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Saylor stressed that MicroStrategy repaid the Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. The company also acquired a significant stash of Bitcoin, purchasing 6,455 BTC for $150 million, or at an average price of $23,238 per coin as of March 23, the former CEO said. According to the filing, MicroStrategy acquired its latest batch of Bitcoin between Feb. 16, 2023 and March 23, 2023. With the purchase, MicroStrategy has increased its total Bitcoins holdings to 138,955 BTC, bought for $4.1 billion at an average of $29,817 per coin, Saylor said. MicroStrategy repaid its $205M Silvergate loan at a 22% discount. As of 3/23/23, $MSTR acquired an additional ~6,455 bitcoins for ~$150M at an average of ~$23,238 per #bitcoin & held ~138,955 BTC acquired for ~$4.14B at an average of ~$29,817 per bitcoin. https://t.co/ALp9VLkTpt As previously announced, MicroStrategy‚Äôs subsidiary MacroStrategy received a $205 million term loan from Silvergate Bank under its Silvergate Exchange Network Leverage program in March 2022. The loan was collateralized by certain Bitcoin owned by MacroStrategy and had a scheduled maturity date of March 23, 2025. Under the terms of the credit agreement, MacroStrategy was required to maintain a loan to collateral value ratio of less than 50%. On March 24, 2023, MacroStrategy and Silvergate entered into a prepayment, waiver and payoff to credit and security agreement, with MacroStrategy voluntarily prepaying Silvergate around $161 million in full repayment. ‚ÄúUpon Silvergate‚Äôs receipt of the payoff amount, the credit agreement was terminated, and Silvergate released its security interest in all of MacroStrategy‚Äôs assets collateralizing the loan, including the Bitcoin that was serving as collateral,‚Äù the filing reads. Related: Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK loading up on Coinbase shares again, buying $18M In the filing, MicroStrategy also mentioned that the company entered into an agreement with two companies ‚Äî Cowen and Company and BTIG ‚Äî to sell its aggregated class A common stock worth $500,000,000. According to the latest updates, MicroStrategy issued and sold an aggregate of 1,348,855 shares under the sales agreement for aggregate net proceeds to MicroStrategy of roughly $339 million.

We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners. Privacy Policy           Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has criticized Ripple‚Äôs litigation strategy in the ongoing lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the classification of XRP as a security. Hoskinson expressed his frustration in a recent Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, stating that Ripple‚Äôs focus on the alleged bias of the SEC towards Ethereum is unproductive and not helpful for the litigation. Hoskinson‚Äôs comments come in the wake of the growing controversy surrounding Ethereum, known as ‚ÄúETHGate,‚Äù where investors claim that Ethereum received a ‚Äúfree pass‚Äù from regulators. At the same time, XRP and other cryptocurrencies were targeted. The theory further claims that Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization was manipulated, and the SEC allowed Ethereum to move ahead while penalizing other cryptocurrencies. Hoskinson acknowledged that the SEC‚Äôs treatment of different cryptocurrencies has been inconsistent, but he dismissed the allegations of fraud by the Ethereum Foundation as hard to prove. ‚ÄúIt (ETHgate) was a campaign based on a lie. Even the founders of XRP refused to acknowledge is a lie. I would love to see Brad, Shwartz and others come out and physically say that all of this attack on our side is based on a lie.‚Äù Said Hoskinson. Addressing the core of Ripple‚Äôs argument, Hoskinson questioned the efficacy of their litigation strategy, particularly in light of their accusations against Ethereum. He argued that Ripple‚Äôs insistence on Ethereum receiving preferential treatment undermines their case against regulatory scrutiny. ‚ÄúYour litigation strategy, your fighting the US government, is to go and say ‚Äòthe only reason Ethereum is not a security is because they bribed the US government,'‚Äù Hoskinson remarked, pointing out the inherent contradiction in Ripple‚Äôs stance. That said, while the allegations of fraud by the Ethereum Foundation are hard to prove, the theory does have some merit. The SEC has been criticized harshly for its alleged inconsistency in choosing which initial coin offerings to label ‚Äúunregistered securities offerings.‚Äù  Recently, pro-ripple lawyer John Deaton blasted the regulator for not investigating ETHGate, stating that ‚Äúthe truth doesn‚Äôt guide them‚Äù and ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt care about justice and free markets in a level playing field. All they care about is their pockets.‚Äù Notably, the SEC has struggled to make a strong case against XRP, particularly given its previous classification of Bitcoin and Ether as ‚Äúnon-securities.‚Äù  ",zycrypto.com,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-blasts-ripples-litigation-strategy-in-xrp-lawsuit/,
,,"Michael Saylor's Bitcoin Discussion on Tucker Carlson (Full Video, Free)","On November 29th, 2021 Michael Saylor, the Founder/CEO at MicroStrategy (a publicly traded company) appeared on Tucker Carlson‚Äôs show to discuss Bitcoin. He did a great job explaining why Bitcoin matters, how it works, and why you should own it. Unfortunately there was only a 3 minute clip on the primetime show, but Carlson and Saylor had an hour-long conversation that was available to Fox subscribers on Tucker Carlson, Today. I found the entire video interview on BitChute for free, which I‚Äôve embedded for you to watch. This video is worth a watch because Saylor tends to do a great job explaining Bitcoin. He uses comparison and analogies that I find to be useful, especially for beginners. I‚Äôve included a bit more context below to help you understand why this is such a great video to share with friends and family. Michael Saylor has purchased almost 3 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin with his public company, MicroStrategy. Earlier in the day (before the video recording), they announced that they had purchased another $400m worth. Saylor personally owns 17,000 Bitcoins as well. Here‚Äôs a tweet where he talks about this. Some have asked how much #BTC I own. I personally #hodl 17,732 BTC which I bought at $9,882 each on average. I informed MicroStrategy of these holdings before the company decided to buy #bitcoin for itself. Michael Saylor has given a lot of interviews and regularly talks on podcasts, video networks, and has even created a website called Hope.com to outline Bitcoin and why it matters. In this video Tucker said that they searched for years to find someone who can explain Bitcoin, and I can see why they chose Michael Saylor. Michael Saylor used to be a Bitcoin critic. Here‚Äôs a tweet of him in 2013 saying that Bitcoin‚Äôs days are numbered: #Bitcoin days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling. He also wrote a book back in 2012 where he predicted the rise of mobile phones and how big of a deal it would be. I‚Äôm sharing this to outline how Michael Saylor tends to understand major trends that shape society. Tucker Carlson is a well-known media personality in conservative circles. Michael Saylor is an established public-company CEO who loves to explain Bitcoin and why it matters. I recommend you share this video with family and friends who watch Fox News!

,,Michael Saylor: Bitcoin ETF would be a 'milestone on the road to institutional adoption',"A Bitcoin ETF would be a big development for the industry, but it wouldn't necessarily lead to major price gains, according to MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. ‚ÄúIt's a milestone on the road to institutional adoption,"" Saylor said, in an interview with The Block. ""I think it's important, but I don't think it drives bitcoin to $5 million overnight.‚Äù Sat in front of the 1886 Monet painting ‚ÄúFields of Tulip with the Rijnsburg Windmill"" ‚Äî perhaps in a nod to deniers that say Bitcoin is a Tulip mania-like bubble ‚Äî Saylor said that it would be a significant move because it provides clarity to institutional investors and shows them that Bitcoin is a legitimate asset. ‚ÄúI think the spot ETF is an endorsement by the regulators of bitcoin as a legitimate asset, but also it provides an onramp where I could go and I could buy $10 million of it in 30 seconds by punching a button,‚Äù he added. The race for a spot ETF is underway at full speed. BlackRock reignited the action on June 15, when it filed for a spot bitcoin fund for the first time. Sensing a change in the winds, Wisdom Tree, Bitwise, Invesco, Valkyrie and Fidelity quickly followed suit in filing ‚Äî not necessarily for the first time ‚Äî for similar funds. On August 10, 2020, MicroStrategy became the first publicly traded company to buy bitcoin as part of its capital allocation strategy, announcing it would buy $250 million worth of bitcoin from its cash reserves that had been generating a 0% yield. Acknowledging his initial skepticism toward Bitcoin back in 2013, Saylor said, ‚ÄúI was slow to recognize the power. I didn't have the need.‚Äù But since embarking on its bitcoin strategy, MicroStrategy has made multiple purchases of the asset, the latest being an acquisition of 12,333 BTC for $347 million in cash. This has expanded its total bitcoin holdings to around 152,333 BTC ‚Äî worth over $4.6 billion.  ‚ÄúWe bought it at $10,000, we bought it at 20, 30, 40, 50. We even bought some at $60,000,‚Äù Saylor said. The net result? Saylor thinks of it as a form of bitcoin dollar-cost averaging, claiming that bitcoin has been the best-performing asset over the last three years.  Turning to MicroStrategy‚Äôs MSTR stock, Saylor said, ‚ÄúYou know, our stock's up 165%. So we actually outperformed bitcoin over the same time period simply by adopting a bitcoin standard and sweeping cash flows and equity and debt and the like into bitcoin.‚Äù Some 34 months into MicroStrategy‚Äôs experiment, ‚ÄúSilver is down 21%. Long dated bonds? They're down 19%. What about gold? Gold's down 5%. Gold is dead money. So all that money printing, none of it found its way into gold,‚Äù Saylor said. ""So what went up in value? Up in price? The Nasdaq is up 23%. The S&P is up 29%. So actually the S&P outperformed Nasdaq. Bitcoin is up 153%. So Bitcoin is outperforming the S&P by a factor of five. It's left gold in the dust,"" he said. Following bitcoin‚Äôs fall from around $69,000 in November 2021 to a low of around $16,000 at the end of last year, Saylor admitted that he had underestimated bitcoin‚Äôs volatility. While he expected fluctuations of around 30%, ‚ÄúI didn't think it would draw down to $16,000. It turned out to be a bit more brutal this cycle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think that Bitcoin is kind of shocking, you know, and a little bit scary to people. But it's spreading at about the fastest rate. We just have to kind of hold on and suit up for the ride. It's not always easy.‚Äù Bitcoin maximalism is a term coined by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in response to the perceived closed-mindedness of bitcoin-only advocates. For Saylor, the definition is ‚Äújust someone that believes Bitcoin is an instrument of economic empowerment.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think that bitcoin is emerging as a supported asset class. If you've got the regulators endorsing it, Congress endorsing it, legislators endorsing it, you've got [presidential] candidates endorsing it, then I think you've turned a corner,‚Äù Saylor said. He added that maximalism has sometimes painted people in a controversial way. Yet he views it quite differently. He sees a maximalist as someone who thinks the object in question is an ethical good. ‚ÄúIf you thought it's an ethical good to give property rights to 8 billion people, and you see a network that is nation state resistant that is not controlled by any company, that's a global network that's open and permissionless. Then you could just say I'm a Bitcoin maximalist. I believe this is an instrument of economic empowerment. It's good for the world,‚Äù he said. Saylor takes a different view on other cryptocurrencies like ether. ‚ÄúEthereum is a different situation, and all these crypto tokens are different issues. They're unregistered securities,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúIf I actually create my own token and I keep a lot of it and I sell some to the world and I manipulate the price of it, and I don't tell you how many I have. And then I change the protocol to give myself more. Without telling you, that was an unregistered security, right?,‚Äù Saylor added. ‚ÄúSo if someone notices that and they object to that, then all they're doing is observing the fact that I'm attempting to manipulate the securities market. I wouldn't endorse that.‚Äù ‚ÄúApple is a registered security. So the question is, if you're going to sell a security to the general public, have you made the full and fair disclosures as to who controls the protocol and what they can expect? And that's a challenging thing. It costs a lot of money to properly disclose any given security. I'm not here to tell you to buy Apple stock. I'm not here to endorse a currency or a trade. I'm here basically to say I like Bitcoin,‚Äù Saylor said. So far, the SEC has made it clear that it views most tokens as securities. The only clear exception appears to be bitcoin. Ether, for its part, is the most ambigious as former SEC officials have expressed views that the agency doesn't appear to hold. When asked to clear up this issue, SEC Chair Gary Gensler refused to say whether ether is a security ‚Äì purporting to claim that there was already enough clarity. Discussing the debate over the surge in popularity of Ordinals NFT-like tokens earlier this year and potential changes to the Bitcoin protocol to restrict them, Saylor said the protocol should just be left alone. ‚ÄúMy general view on the protocol is you shouldn't really change it unless there's an overwhelming consensus in the community that we're facing a fatal defect,‚Äù Saylor said. ‚ÄúOtherwise, I think most innovation ought to take place consistent with the protocol. If they want to create new open protocols, they should create them on Layer 2s like Lightning.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm an Austrian economist, so I would say it's okay to criticize people's business ideas, but one should not censor,‚Äù he added. ""Just like if you open up a bakery and you sell really awful donuts made of sawdust. It's a stupid idea. I wouldn't invest in it. I won't buy your sawdust donuts. You'll probably go bankrupt. But I don't think the mayor should pass a law saying you have to get permission before you sell your sawdust donuts in my town.‚Äù Ordinals have continued to expand across bitcoin, as both NFTs and tokens, leaving higher transaction fees in their wake. Last month, NFTs on Bitcoin saw $15 million of trading volume.

,,Michael Saylor promotes economic empowerment with free ‚ÄúBitcoin for Everybody‚Äù course,"      Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Michael Saylor has made many worthy contributions since bursting onto the cryptocurrency scene. His latest, the free ‚ÄúBitcoin for Everybody‚Äù course, intends to give beginners a basic rundown of the leading cryptocurrency. In a tweet, Saylor said the course would help those looking to get into Bitcoin. This, he hopes, will promote economic empowerment and may also convert an army of no-coiners into believers. ‚ÄúIntroducing Bitcoin for Everybody ‚Äì a free course to educate the world on #bitcoin and assist anyone seeking to harness this digital monetary network to promote economic empowerment.‚Äù The ‚ÄúBitcoin for Everybody‚Äù course takes around 12 hours to complete. It consists of articles, lectures, and videos to take students through the basics of Bitcoin. The five-unit course ends with a final examination and a free certificate upon successful completion. The course units are economics, investment, history and philosophy, technology, and Bitcoin in practice. At the end of the course, students will understand the landscape and be confident in transacting. ‚ÄúOnce you have completed this course, you will have a basic level of Bitcoin knowledge and be able to start interacting with Bitcoin by buying, receiving, storing, and spending it.‚Äù Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy hit the headlines last August when it became the first publicly listed company to hold significant BTC quantities as a treasury strategy. He has since done countless interviews and tweets to promote the cause. He believes buying BTC can protect against the inflationary aspects of fiat currency. But more than that, he sees a growing realization of this, leading to a tipping point of mass institutional inflows. ‚ÄúOnce people start thinking about what they want, which is a non-sovereign, safe-haven store of value, they‚Äôre going to realize that Bitcoin does the job of gold better, and you‚Äôre seeing all of the institutional flows move out of gold into Bitcoin.‚Äù Saylor mentioned that his day to day interactions highlighted a demand to copy what MicroStrategy did. But there‚Äôs much uncertainty on how to do it, as well as the regulatory and legal ramifications of doing so. This is why his recent ‚ÄúBitcoin for Corporations‚Äù seminar was developed. The free two-day event ended on February 5 and was a smash hit, pulling in 8,197 attendees from 6,917 different companies. After sharing the playbook, Saylor said he expects an avalanche of companies to buy Bitcoin in the coming 12 months. Giving interviews and tweeting about Bitcoin is great. But Saylor takes his belief in economic empowerment through Bitcoin to the next level. His efforts in bringing free educational resources for both individuals and corporations have done more than any governmental body.

,,"After Breaking All-Time High, Is Bitget‚Äôs BGB Token Poised for More Growth in 2024?","0 0 The recent flurry of spot bitcoin ETF approvals has caused a groundswell of optimism in the wider cryptocurrency market, which briefly surpassed the momentous $2 trillion market cap milestone last week. Naturally, a range of blockchain projects and digital tokens have risen in value as a consequence of Bitcoin‚Äôs success, with the feel-good factor spreading outward. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all. That being said, bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory is no guarantee that all digital currencies will follow suit ‚Äì in the short term or the long. One token that has certainly accumulated momentum of late is BGB, the native currency of trading platform Bitget. Home to over 20 million users in 100 countries, Bitget launched its ERC-20 token in July 2021 and it‚Äôs been on a rather steady climb since last January. Indeed, it recently crossed $1 for the first time, at one stage hitting an all-time high of $1.15 on February 17 before falling slightly.  At the time of writing, the BGB token is still above a dollar, trading at $1.02, an increase of almost 55% in the last seven days. The rise over the past month is even more pronounced, with 70% gains. When market sentiment brightens, exchange tokens are often the biggest winners as trading activity spikes and users reap the benefits of interacting with a trading platform‚Äôs native asset. BGB is a perfect case in point and demonstrates the market‚Äôs growing confidence, as well as its potential for further growth. What is notable about BGB, though, is the steadiness of its ascent with no volatile spikes.  Irrespective of what the wider market is doing ‚Äì and post-ETF the focus is now shifting to Bitcoin‚Äôs fourth Halving event in April ‚Äì Bitget has committed to strengthening the value proposition of BGB and aligning the token with the overall growth of the exchange. A big part of this will be furnishing holders with benefits when they stake. At present, staking BGB delivers an annual return of 2%, on top of daily free withdrawal limits that help users evade the rocketing transaction fees that are a corollary of bullish market phases. Moreover, the token grants users exclusive access to projects launching on the Bitget Innovation Zone, giving token-holders an opportunity to get in on the ground floor as promising ventures lift off. Although the gains pocketed by BGB over the past month are impressive, it‚Äôs only February ‚Äì and with VC funding rising for the first time in 18 months and retail investors re-entering the market, many analysts believe the stage is set for the next crypto bull run. As Alyssa Choo, crypto equities specialist at Bitwise, observes: ‚ÄúEveryone wants to be a part of the bull market.‚Äù In light of this reality, and providing the market continues tracking positively as the Halving looms into focus, and even beyond, there is a bullish case to be made for the continued growth of BGB. Not least since the token appears undervalued compared to counterparts such as OKX‚Äôs native currency, OKB.  The market cap of BGB at the time of writing is $1.43 billion, compared to $14.8bn for OKX. Yet this disparity is not borne out by the platforms‚Äô respective trading volume, as Bitget handles approximately 70% of OKX‚Äôs volume. Moreover, Bitget‚Äôs derivative trading volume grew by an incredible 28% in the first month of the year. Needless to say, it is extremely difficult to estimate just how much upside there is in BGB ‚Äì or indeed any token. While most experts are confident bitcoin will have a banner year, and that should mean strong gains for many exchange tokens, there is no guarantee.  Certainly, native tokens belonging to exchanges which are growing in other areas ‚Äì particularly trade volume ‚Äì have stronger fundamentals behind them than highly speculative tokens not tied to tangible products, i.e. hit-and-hope memecoins.  Price aside, Bitget‚Äôs profile has been growing over the past year, thanks in no small part to its World Cup-winning brand ambassador (and possibly history‚Äôs greatest ever footballer) Lionel Messi. Unlike many competitor exchanges, it also offers a raft of ancillary products and services including an NFT Marketplace and dApp browser.  Unsurprisingly though, it‚Äôs the BGB token that‚Äôs been hogging most of the recent limelight. Investors will do well to keep a close eye on the asset in the coming months.

,,Is MicroStrategy Still a Leveraged Bitcoin Play?,"  Pure Plays: By OPTO  15 Feb 2024, 16:55 Thematic investing relies on exposure to long-term trends. However, many thematic indices and funds contain stocks that do not align with their stated objectives. Seasoned emerging markets (EM) investor Kevin T Carter made this point on OPTO Sessions when explaining the drawbacks of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which, he says, selects companies based on the location of their headquarters. However, ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre investing in EM consumer technology, you don‚Äôt care about where the company is. You care about where the revenue is coming from.‚Äù In other words, to gain exposure to a trend (such as EM consumer technology), it‚Äôs important to clearly identify a company‚Äôs, fund‚Äôs, or index‚Äôs source of revenue. In this OPTO series, we examine stocks that offer the purest exposure to key themes through a detailed assessment of their revenue streams. MicroStrategy [MSTR] is an interesting example of a stock that bucks the pure play trend. While it derives very little revenue from bitcoin, the cryptocurrency accounts for most of the company‚Äôs shareholder equity. MicroStrategy is a software house that develops business intelligence products for enterprises. It was a relatively obscure stock with a market cap of approximately $1.2bn until August 2020, when its CEO Michael Saylor announced plans to start spending its excess cash reserves on bitcoin as part of the company‚Äôs capital allocation scheme, making MicroStrategy the first publicly traded company to announce a cryptocurrency strategy of this kind. The upshot has been a significant increase in interest in MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock, which suddenly offered an avenue for investors that wanted exposure to bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly owning bitcoin themselves. MicroStrategy effectively turned itself into a treasury for bitcoin by filling its balance sheet with the digital asset, and its stock soared as a result. As of 15 February, MicroStrategy‚Äôs market cap is nearly $13bn, up 982% from August 2020. Saylor has consistently maintained the strategy; in the final month of 2023, MicroStrategy acquired 14,620 bitcoin for $616m. This approach has made MicroStrategy a darling for crypto advocates. It is the largest holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF [BLOK], accounting for 6% of the fund‚Äôs assets. Because it uses debt financing and share sales to pay for its bitcoin stores, MicroStrategy is more than just a proxy for bitcoin price movements. It acts as a leveraged play on the cryptocurrency with no added fees, Saylor told Bloomberg TV in December. As such, its price movements can be more volatile than those of bitcoin itself.  However, despite gains in the market value of bitcoin during the period it has been acquiring it, MicroStrategy has been writing down the value of its bitcoin assets. Accounting rules in the US state that an intangible asset is considered impaired if, at any point during a reporting period, its value drops below its purchase price. Its ‚Äòcarrying value‚Äô must then be permanently written down to the lowest value that it reached during that reporting period, and the company must recognise a corresponding loss. MicroStrategy buys bitcoin every quarter, but given the asset‚Äôs volatility, it will frequently dip below the purchase price later on. So ‚Äî highly counter-intuitively ‚Äî MicroStrategy has technically made $2.3bn of impairment losses on bitcoin assets it had bought for $5.9bn, and which as of 31 December were valued at over $8bn. This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that its bitcoin strategy has swelled MicroStrategy‚Äôs balance sheet. Its digital assets increased 97.3% year-over-year in 2023, and accounted for 76% of total assets, which grew by 97.5%. Revenues from MicroStrategy‚Äôs software business actually fell 0.6% from 2022, but thanks to its bitcoin strategy, its stockholder equity increased from a deficit of $383.1m to $2.2bn. For MicroStrategy investors, it has paid to look beyond revenue as the defining factor of a stock‚Äôs purity. MicroStrategy‚Äôs software arm generated a $96.3m profit in Q4 2023, but the market value of the bitcoin it held at the end of the quarter increased by $3.8bn, or 88%, from Q3. The company spent $1.2bn on new bitcoin assets during this period, but its pre-existing bitcoin reserves increased in value by $2.6bn, dwarfing the contribution that the company‚Äôs software profits added to its balance sheet during the quarter. In other words, while MicroStrategy is a software stock as far as its revenue is concerned, bitcoin price movements account for the vast majority of changes in its shareholder equity. Despite accounting rules that mark down the carrying value of bitcoin holdings, Saylor‚Äôs strategy has been a success since its launch in August 2020, largely due to bitcoin‚Äôs outsized gains during that period. Given the volatility of bitcoin, and the amount of high-profile events that have occurred over the last three and a half years (such as the collapse of FTX in 2022), it is unsurprising that both MicroStrategy stock and spot bitcoin prices have seen giddy highs and crushing lows during that period. As of 15 February, bitcoin has gained 356.5% over the life of MicroStrategy‚Äôs bitcoin uptake strategy, while the company‚Äôs stock has gained 521.3%. However ‚Äî and despite Saylor insisting the opposite ‚Äî recent developments could undermine the relationship between MicroStrategy stock and bitcoin prices. The SEC approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in January, meaning that investors who wanted exposure to bitcoin‚Äôs price movements without directly owning it suddenly had alternatives to MicroStrategy. Saylor told Bloomberg TV in December that the launch of such ETFs wouldn‚Äôt threaten MicroStrategy since its stock was already a fee-free, leveraged bet on bitcoin. Historically, this appears accurate; almost every time the bitcoin price has increased since August 2020, MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock has gained more than the cryptocurrency. That volatility has, at times, also meant the stock has taken steeper falls. Since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs on 11 January, both assets have increased in value, but MicroStrategy‚Äôs gains of 43.6% have outpaced bitcoin‚Äôs 11.8%. It is noteworthy that Saylor himself sold as many as 5,000 shares during the week prior to the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. Other erstwhile bulls have also signalled their hesitancy. While it remains the top holding in the fund, Amplify‚Äôs BLOK ETF sold 15,772 MicroStrategy shares in Q4 of last year, according to WhaleWisdom data.

,,"Defi on BTC blockchain could accumulate $225b, Pantera Capital says","share Analysts at Pantera Capital see a half-trillion-dollar opportunity in bringing decentralized finance to Bitcoin, potentially making Bitcoin-based decentralized apps top assets in crypto. Pantera Capital analysts have identified a significant opportunity worth over half a trillion dollars in bringing decentralized finance (defi) to the Bitcoin blockchain, potentially positioning Bitcoin-based decentralized applications as leading assets in the crypto space. In a recent email newsletter, Pantera Capital highlighted the potential for Bitcoin to accumulate $450 billion in liquidity through defi projects, particularly if they achieve similar market shares as those that can be seen on the Ethereum blockchain right now. So far, Ethereum dominates the defi landscape, hosting the majority of activity, according to Pantera Capital. Historically, decentralized applications on Ethereum have represented between 8% and 50% of Ethereum‚Äôs market capitalization, with the current figure standing at approximately 25%. Extrapolating these proportions to Bitcoin suggests the potential for the network to attract around $225 billion in value. Moreover, Pantera Capital predicts that the leading decentralized application on Bitcoin could eventually reach a valuation of $20 billion, firmly establishing itself among the top most valuable assets in the ecosystem. ‚ÄúThis would place it squarely in the top 10 most valuable assets in the crypto ecosystem. Bitcoin is nearly back to being a trillion-dollar asset. Yet, it still holds an untapped half-trillion dollar opportunity.‚Äù Pantera Capital In mid-January, Pantera Capital emphasized the importance of selecting tokens with robust underlying protocols and proven product-market fit, expecting them to outperform in the upcoming cycle. Although Pantera Capital did not name specific tokens, the firm said that over the long term, token selection will be ‚Äúparamount because outperformance will be on a case-by-case basis and not necessarily in a certain sector or based on fickle, short-lived speculative narratives.‚Äù The hedge fund also said it expects the growth of defi on the Bitcoin blockchain to continue in the foreseeable future, with total value locked on the platform potentially rising to 1-2% of Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap.

,,Michael Saylor Says Demand for Bitcoin Outstrips Supply by 10x: Is He Right?," In a recent CNBC interview, Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, cast a spotlight on the burgeoning demand for Bitcoin (BTC), estimating it to outpace supply by an astounding tenfold. As cryptocurrency markets brim with excitement over the recent launch of Bitcoin ETFs, Saylor‚Äôs comments have fueled excited discussions about Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory and its implications for the broader market. Saylor attributed the explosive demand for Bitcoin to the recent introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) catering to the cryptocurrency. These ETFs, he argued, are not just a new investment vehicle but represent nearly a decade of pent-up demand from investors eager for accessible BTC products. They make gaining direct exposure to Bitcoin significantly easier for both retail traders and institutions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs ten times as much demand for bitcoin coming into these ETFs as there is supply coming from the natural sellers who are the miners,‚Äù Saylor emphasized, highlighting the significant imbalance driving BTC‚Äôs price upward. He‚Äôs certainly correct that the advent of these ETFs is driving an increase in volume but it‚Äôs impossible to say if it will last. The allure of Bitcoin, according to Saylor, lies in its unique characteristics: it is uncorrelated with traditional risk assets and immune to the economic and geopolitical vulnerabilities that plague other investments.   This digital asset offers a haven not tethered to the fluctuations of any single country, company, or external factor, making it an increasingly attractive option for investors worldwide. In a move reflecting the company‚Äôs successful multi-year foray into cryptocurrency, Michael Saylor announced that MicroStrategy would rebrand itself as a Bitcoin development company. This strategic pivot aims to leverage the firm‚Äôs position as the world‚Äôs largest public company holder of Bitcoin, focusing on accumulating more Bitcoin and fostering the growth of the BTC network. Saylor‚Äôs comparison of MicroStrategy to a real estate or petroleum development company underscores the innovative approach the firm is taking towards cryptocurrency investment and development. Listen to Michael @Saylor explain why his company owns $8,200,000,000 of #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/E7BuH55qmt ‚Äî Documenting ‚Çøitcoin üìÑ (@DocumentingBTC) February 7, 2024  Adding to the bullish sentiment, Grayscale, a leading crypto asset management firm, released a research note suggesting that Bitcoin is ‚Äústronger‚Äù ahead of its anticipated halving event, It points to improved technical fundamentals and increased use cases as the drivers of this strength. The note points to the surge in on-chain activity driven by innovations like ordinal inscriptions and the BRC-20 standard, which have introduced new revenue streams for miners and revitalized developer interest in the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin was a simple blockchain that couldn‚Äôt facilitate the use of other tokens on its network until the invention of the BRC-20 standard changed that notion entirely. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed significant holdings since their launch, are expected to exert further buying pressure on the market. With the halving event poised to reduce the reward for mining BTC blocks, the resulting decrease in selling pressure, coupled with sustained demand, could lead to a steady price increase for Bitcoin in the post-halving landscape. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the insights shared by Michael Saylor and the analysis from Grayscale point towards a robust future for Bitcoin. The interplay between increased ETF-driven demand, strategic corporate involvement in BTC development, and the innovative use cases emerging on the Bitcoin blockchain paints a picture of a maturing market ready for the next phase of growth. With the potential for Bitcoin ETFs to introduce a new wave of investors to the cryptocurrency market, the dynamics of supply and demand are set to undergo significant shifts. Especially as BTC approaches its next halving event ‚Äì a potential imminent supply shock, the market watches closely, anticipating the impact of these developments on BTC‚Äôs price and its broader role in the financial ecosystem. In conclusion, the bullish outlook shared by Michael Saylor, coupled with the strategic shifts and market analyses, underscores the growing recognition of BTC‚Äôs unique value proposition. He is far from the only analyst pointing out the many positive signals surrounding Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market. As demand continues to outstrip supply and the market braces for the halving event, the stage is set for an intriguing chapter in Bitcoin‚Äôs ongoing evolution.

,,MicroStrategy's $10B bitcoin stash sits on 70% unrealized profit,"Jason Koerner/Getty Images Entertainment Enterprise-software provider MicroStrategy's (NASDAQ:MSTR) bitcoin (BTC-USD) holdings are worth some $10B, based on current prices, sitting on an unrealized profit of nearly 70%. Earlier this month, Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (MSTR) said it held 190K bitcoin on its balance sheet, with a total cost of $5.93B, or $31,224 per token. The company started to invest its cash into BTC in 2020, only to become the biggest corporate holder of the highest-profile cryptocurrency. This year alone, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has climbed 17.7%, hitting an over two-year high of $52.7K on Thursday. MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, which gained ~22% so far this year, has a strong relationship with the price of bitcoin, as seen in this chart. Over the years, the company has raised capital by selling stock and issuing bonds to buy large blocks of bitcoin (BTC-USD), making MSTR a proxy for the digital token. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) ""is novel, digital, global, unique, and uncorrelated to traditional risk assets,"" Saylor said in a recent post on X.

,,Michael Saylor Says MicroStrategy Will Never Sell Its Bitcoin,"                                                                                                                   Andrew Throuvalas  MicroStrategy remains fully committed to its macro-strategy of investing everything it can into Bitcoin. Company CEO Michael Saylor recently confirmed that the company would ‚Äúnever‚Äù sell its Bitcoin, even given the current state of the market. Though the asset has helped the institution profit tremendously overall, it is down on its 2021 positions. The CEO affirmed his devotion to Bitcoin in a recent interview with Bloomberg. However, Saylor dismissed the thought when asked whether he was tempted to sell given Bitcoin‚Äôs slide over the past two months. ‚ÄúNever. No. We‚Äôre not sellers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only acquiring and holding Bitcoin, right? That‚Äôs our strategy.‚Äù Saylor first announced his company‚Äôs plan to convert its cash holdings to Bitcoin in the Summer of 2020. The excitement generated by the move swung MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock up as high as 900% ever since the software vendor has made regular Bitcoin purchases in hundreds of millions of dollars at a time. According to Saylor‚Äôs updates over Twitter, its most recent purchase in December put its holdings at 124,391. That‚Äôs over 0.5% of the total Bitcoin supply that will ever exist. Yet, in light of last year, Saylor‚Äôs Bitcoin position hasn‚Äôt exactly been profitable. Since February, the average listing price for every Bitcoin his company has bought is above current levels. Nevertheless, earlier buys leave MicroStrategy‚Äôs total Bitcoin still in the green. Fundamentally, Saylor considers Bitcoin the greatest weapon against inflation in existence. For example, in the United States, CPI inflation was 7.0% for December 2021 ‚Äì the highest in 39 years. ‚ÄúThe best defense against inflation is a Bitcoin standard. So I don‚Äôt really think we could do anything better to position our company in an inflationary environment than to convert our balance sheet to Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. Saylor has spoken on numerous occasions arguing for Bitcoin‚Äôs astronomically high long term price potential. Calling it the ‚Äúapex property of the human race,‚Äù he even surmised that it could reach a $100 trillion market cap. Per Bitcoin, that would be about $5 million. For this reason, MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin accumulation goes beyond defensive inflation hedging and is now its primary method for making a profit. In addition, many investors are now using MicroStrategy as a quasi- spot Bitcoin ETF, given that a real one is yet to receive SEC approval.

,,Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings Worth Over $10B,"Michael Saylor‚Äôs business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy, has seen its Bitcoin holdings now worth more than $10 billion. Indeed, the total value of the holdings has skyrocketed as the asset is nearing the $53,000 mark to close out the week. Moreover, the company‚Äôs Bitcoin investment has simultaneously eclipsed $4 billion in profit. In a recent investor presentation, Microstrategy stated that they had acquired a total of 190,000 BTC for a total of $5.93 billion. Subsequently, that acquisition came at $31,224 per BTC. Therefore, the overall profit of the early Bitcoin bet is paying off big amid its noticeable surge over the last week. Also Read: Michael Saylor‚Äôs MicroStrategy Bitcoin Hits $3.5B Unrealized Profit For many digital asset investors, 2024 was set to be a monumental year. Specifically, it would see the price of Bitcoin lead the industry to a massive uptick in value. The presence of newly-approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs would set the stage for what could be a vital year for its value growth. Subsequently, some of the earliest believers in the asset are seeing their investments pay off. Among them is none other than Michael Saylor, whose business intelligence firm, MicroStrategy has seen its Bitcoin holdings surpass $10 billion in value. Also Read: Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin‚Äôs Potential Tenfold Surge Indeed, the value of those holdings has seen a massive uptick as BTC itself has observed quite a surge over the last week. Surpassing $52,000 earlier, the price is slowly near the key $53,000 level. Amid that increase, MicrStrategy‚Äôs holdings have resulted in $4 billion worth of profit. MicroStrategy first began its Bitcoin acquisition plan in 2020 and has increased its holdings in every single quarter since. Since just last year, the value of those tokens has doubled following a 20% rally since 2024 first started. Conversely, with the Bitcoin halving on the horizon, the value of those tokens should continue to grow.  Disclaimer: Our articles are NOT financial advice, we are not financial advisors.

,,MicroStrategy CEO Saylor says bitcoin‚Äôs near-term volatility largely irrelevant,"Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term volatility is largely irrelevant once you understand the fundamentals of the leading cryptocurrency and how difficult it would be to create something better, according to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. ""Bitcoin is the most certain thing in a very uncertain world, it's more certain than the other 19,000 cryptocurrencies, it's more certain than any stock, it's more certain than owning property anywhere in the world,‚Äù he said in an interview with The Block last week after appearing at CoinMarketCap‚Äôs The Capital virtual conference. People who have spent at least $100 on bitcoin can speak about the cryptocurrency, Saylor allowed, but otherwise they probably ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have anything to say about it.‚Äù  Saylor‚Äôs software company holds a massive bitcoin position ‚Äî owning, including through subsidiaries, about 129,218 bitcoins ‚Äî and he has become a leading proponent of the cryptocurrency since adding it to his company‚Äôs balance sheet in August 2020. MicroStrategy‚Äôs most recent purchase, revealed in an April 5 filing, was the acquisition of 4,167 bitcoin worth about $190.5 million at the time, when bitcoin was trading at $45,714. The company has acquired its total bitcoin holdings at an average price of $30,700. With bitcoin trading at  $29,716.37 on Sunday, Saylor‚Äôs company is in the red on its purchases ‚Äî although it has no plans to sell, he said.  He said bitcoin would have to fall 95% before the company would consider doing anything, even then, he has said in the past, the company could post alternative collateral.  In order to fund its bitcoin bet, MicroStrategy took out three loans between December 2020 and June 2021 by issuing convertible senior notes and senior secured notes.  Convertible senior notes are debt securities that contain options to be converted into a certain amount of the issuer‚Äôs equity once they hit maturity. When they mature they must either be converted into equity, repaid in cash or a combination of both. Senior secured notes are loans that use the issuer‚Äôs assets as a form of collateral. MicroStrategy issued senior secured notes in June 2021, secured by assets that included any bitcoin bought on or after the closing of the offering. Still, it did not include any of MicroStrategy‚Äôs existing bitcoin, or any that might be purchased with the proceeds from existing bitcoin or other holdings.  In May, MicroStrategy‚Äôs share price hit a 20-month low of $159.67 before recovering to close the month at $246.65, still down from an open of $355.68. During the month, the company‚Äôs bitcoin position fell into the red, where it remains.  Bitcoin prices plunged in May, as the cryptocurrency market, as well as broader financial markets, were in tumult. After an initial crash in crypto prices early in the month, and as the wider macroeconomic environment worsened, prices plunged further amid the Terra blockchain collapse, following the failure of its stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST).  This contagion dragged bitcoin below $30,000 as it fell to its lowest levels in 18 months, since trading at about $27,000 on December 21, 2020. While many observers declared this to be clear evidence of a crypto bear market, Saylor said he is not convinced.  ‚ÄúI don't know if it's a bear market or not, but if it is a bear market, then we had three of them in the last 24 months,‚Äù he told The Block. Saylor was alluding to April 2021, when the price rose to $60,000 before falling back to about $31,000 by July 2021, then hitting all-time highs of $69,000 in November 2021.  Saylor said he prefers not to get caught up in near-term prices, adding that people focusing too much on charts are ‚Äúplaying with tea leaves.‚Äù His take: ‚ÄúIf you're not planning to hold it for four years, you're not really an investor at all, you're a trader, and my advice for traders is don't trade it, invest in it.‚Äù One of the primary reasons bitcoin and crypto prices fell in May was the capitulation of TerraUSD and luna (LUNA), the Terra blockchain‚Äôs two main offerings.  Terra‚Äôs ecosystem came under pressure after its stablecoin, TerraUSD, lost its peg against the dollar on May 7. A shared relationship between TerraUSD and luna then dragged both down, even though TerraUSD had a ‚Äúforex reserve‚Äù of more than $3 billion in bitcoin that it offloaded in a futile attempt to defend its peg. TerraUSD had a burn mechanism involving luna so that anyone holding TerraUSD could trade one token for $1 worth of luna tokens in the event of a de-peg ‚Äî if TerraUSD were trading at $0.95 for example.  This would make TerraUSD more scarce and was supposed to pull the price back toward $1, also allowing holders to take advantage of the price difference and potentially make an arbitrage profit, incentivizing them to maintain the peg. Still, after TerraUSD lost its dollar peg on May 7, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) ‚Äî a non-profit managing Terra‚Äôs forex reserve ‚Äî  used up most of its reserves to buy UST in an unsuccessful attempt to defend the peg. Despite the collapse of TerraUSD and the depletion of its bitcoin reserves, Saylor maintained that bitcoin is a worthwhile reserve asset.  ‚ÄúI think it all comes down to the amount of leverage. I think it makes a lot of sense to use bitcoin as a reserve asset,‚Äù he said, noting that with reasonable leverage, such as owning $1 billion worth of bitcoin and issuing $50 million worth of a stablecoin, there would be significantly less risk involved with using bitcoin as a reserve asset.  The issue with Terra wasn't so much the idea of owning bitcoin, he said, but that they had too much TerraUSD outstanding.

,,Michael Saylor says investing in MicroStrategy is the closest you'll get to a bitcoin spot ETF,"                                                                                                                    Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET In this article MIAMI ‚Äî MicroStrategy
may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but CEO Michael Saylor says the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin
spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,‚Äù Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami. So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has only approved ETFs that track contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. The commission has refused to greenlight any of the formal applications for a pure-play bitcoin-based ETF ‚Äî a financial instrument that would give investors the chance to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the motions of signing up for an exchange, opening a crypto wallet, or dealing with any of the other logistics involved with buying and holding bitcoin. ‚ÄúIf there was a spot ETF, you‚Äôd be paying a 1% fee, and it wouldn‚Äôt be leveraged. With MicroStrategy, we have a software company that generates cash flow, so we convert our cash flows into bitcoin,‚Äù continued Saylor, who says the de facto MicroStrategy bitcoin spot ETF generates a 4% to 5% tax-deferred yield. MicroStrategy, which was launched by Saylor in 1989, has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet for the last two years. The company has now spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700. Saylor doesn‚Äôt have any plans to stop buying bitcoin, which will only further grow MicroStrategy‚Äôs exposure to the digital asset. ‚ÄúWhy would we ever stop?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs we generate cash flows, we think that the responsible thing to do for our shareholders is we convert currency which is devaluing, into an asset which is appreciating,‚Äù said Saylor, who also noted that MicroStrategy is not diversifying because he feels the company owes shareholders a consistent strategy. ‚ÄúIf you want to be 2% exposed to bitcoin, you‚Äôd put 2% of your portfolio into MicroStrategy, and the other 98% of your portfolio, you can invest in whatever you want. They don‚Äôt want the CEO of a publicly traded company to be unpredictable and random.‚Äù When MicroStrategy first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in August 2020, it was a pretty unpopular thing to do. This was back at the tail end of the crypto winter when the coin was trading in the low $11,000 range, and many institutional investors and big Wall Street banks remained bearish on digital assets. But Saylor‚Äôs move soon proved prescient. As bitcoin‚Äôs upswing began in earnest in October 2020, old-school, billionaire hedge fund managers like Stanley Druckenmiller reversed course and began buying bitcoin. Major companies like Tesla
, Block
(formerly Square), and insurer MassMutual also followed suit, plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin. This kind of mainstream adoption is hugely important, because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren‚Äôt backed by an asset, nor do they have the full faith and backing of the government. They‚Äôre valuable, in part, because people believe they‚Äôre valuable. So it goes a long way when bitcoin gets buy-in from some of the biggest names on Wall Street. Saylor‚Äôs evangelism of bitcoin has helped to make him an A-lister in the community. Throughout the Bitcoin 2022 conference, Saylor would traverse the Miami Beach Convention Center trailed by an entourage of fans, vying for a selfie with him. Blue chip CEOs also look to the MicroStrategy CEO for a how-to on corporate adoption. MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral ‚Äî to then buy more of the cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúWe have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I‚Äôm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,‚Äù said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital
also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank. ‚ÄúAs people realize they can borrow against something, then they realize they never have to sell it, and then they start to stretch their time horizon from ‚Äî ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a 36-month speculation,‚Äô to ‚Äî ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a 36-year holding,‚Äô‚Äù Saylor told CNBC.

,,"Bitcoin price leans south, $48,000 in sight after sending MicroStrategy to a $12 billion market capitalization","            Lockridge Okoth
FXStreet Bitcoin (BTC) price has recorded a steady rise over the last few months, with the uptrend catapulting the market capitalization of MicroStrategy. Steadily, the firm is approaching the merit list for S&P 500 listing.  Also Read: Bitcoin Price Prediction: $160 million long positions liquidated as BTC slips 2% Boasting around 190,000 BTC tokens worth almost $10 billion, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy now records a market capitalization of $12 billion. It comes after the firm made a big bet on the giant crypto, BTC, with the boldness almost earning the company a place on the American stock market‚Äôs most important index, the S&P 500. NEW: Now at a $12 billion market cap after its #Bitcoin bet, MicroStrategy is close to qualifying for the S&P 500

One of the largest companies in the world pic.twitter.com/9a9Xn3lGpl The threshold for listing on the S&P 500, the list of America‚Äôs largest 500 publicly-traded firms, is possession of a market capitalization no lower than $15.8 billion. With such a high bar, it is not easy for a company to make it to this selection criterion. Nevertheless, MicroStrategy is progressively recording steady growth with its Bitcoin investments, catapulting itself toward the threshold with every purchase. Besides another voluminous purchase, another factor that could propel MicroStrategy closer to the S&P 500 threshold is a show of strength by Bitcoin price. Specifically, if BTC extends north, clearing the $52,985 range high and ultimately retaking its all-time high of $69,000. As it stands, BTC is only 23% away from its peak price, with a listing on the S&P 500 likely to inspire confidence in Bitcoin, so much so that BTC could easily start making its way into nearly every portfolio. Rising market cap and TTM profitability could position $MSTR for S&P 500 eligibility, pending U.S. Index Committee approval.

If MSTR is included, it could spark a massive positive feedback loop enabling #bitcoin to begin automatically infiltrating nearly every portfolio. pic.twitter.com/2e4m6oXGJu Other selection criteria for the S&P 500 include meeting liquidity thresholds and a consistent track record of profit-making for a minimum period of four successive quarters right before making the application. Meanwhile, in an interview with Bloomberg, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be buying the top forever,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúBitcoin is the exit strategy. It is the strongest asset.‚Äù Bitcoin price is leaning to the south, after slipping below the immediate support at $51,335. It comes after the Relative Strength Index (RSI) executed a sell signal, crossing below its signal line (yellow band). The histogram bars of the Awesome Oscillator (AO) are also flashing red. Those of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) fade while edging toward negative territory. The MACD is also almost crossing below its signal line (orange band), a crossover that has historically instigated a bearish cycle. With these features, Bitcoin price could produce a 7% fall to the $48,000 psychological level. If this level fails to hold, sidelined investors could have a chance to enter right above the supply zone turned bullish breaker between $45,556 and $46,691. However, a break and close below its midline at $46,166 would confirm an extended fall.  BTC/USDT 1-day chart Conversely, if the bulls find strength, Bitcoin price could push north to escape the confines of the ascending channel. Such a move could see BTC clear the $52,985 range high, with a decisive move above this blockade invalidating the bullish thesis. The next logical target for Bitcoin would be the $55,000 milestone, or in a highly bullish case, the $60,000 psychological level.  The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. Since its inception, a total of 19,445,656 BTCs have been mined, which is the circulating supply of Bitcoin. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains.

On top of that, with its rock-solid fundamentals and a surge in demand, Polkadot isn‚Äôt just a glitch on the radar anymore ‚Äì it‚Äôs becoming the go-to choice for savvy investors.

,,Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Bull Michael Saylor Says No Reason ‚ÄúTo Sell The Winner And Buy Losers‚Äù As Analysts Predict This Bitcoin Derivative Might 10X," Don‚Äôt invest unless you‚Äôre prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage The Bitcoin price dropped 1.3% in the last 24 hours to trade at $50,928 as of 05:11 a.m. EST on trading volume that surged 46% to $32.88 billion. This comes as MicroStrategy co-founder and BTC Bull Michael Saylor says that he has no plans to sell Bitcoin. #Bitcoin is the Exit Strategy. pic.twitter.com/aauBgmE25a ‚Äî Michael Saylor‚ö°Ô∏è (@saylor) February 20, 2024  His decision aligns with his belief that Bitcoin is ‚Äútechnically stronger‚Äù than gold, the S&P 500, and real estate. Supporting his sentiment, Saylor believes that in this case, there is no reason to sell the winner (BTC) to buy the losers (others).  ‚ÄùBitcoin is the exit strategy,‚Äù he said. MicroStrategy holds 190,000 BTC, worth around $9.88 billion at current prices. This makes the firm one of the major holders of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin price market behavior exhibits a consolidation phase, as evident in the recent trading sessions. BTC is currently in a tight range, with resistance near the $52,500 level and support around the $50,850 mark. Bitcoin attempted to breach the resistance at $52,515, which was short-lived as it retraced back into its established range. Additionally, BTC is trading above the 100-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, which indicate strong bullish sentiments for the BTC price. The 50-day SMA is trading above the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross at $42,895, further supporting the bullish prospects for the price.  The Relative Strength Index is currently on a downward trend as it moves to the oversold region at 40. If the oscillator reaches the 30-oversold region, it likely indicates that the price is set to rebound, signaling investors to consider buying. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line (blue) is trading below the signal line (orange) but above the zero line, which may signal an impending bullish reversal. The red bars further support this as they reduce in size towards the zero line. The Bitcoin price technical analysis shows bullish bias, evident from the price trending within the rising channel. The bulls are aiming to come out of the consolidation phase within the channel, breaching the upper boundary of the channel. The bulls are currently targeting $57,500. However, the MACD line is trending downward towards the zero line. If the line crosses below the line, it may cause a price retrace to $48,642, coinciding with the immediate support zone, the 100-day SMA. Meanwhile, investors are turning to Bitcoin Minetrix, a Bitcoin derivative that analysts say has the potential to 10X on launch. Bitcoin Minetrix (BTCMTX) is an innovative project that paves the way for decentralized and tokenized Bitcoin mining, making it accessible even to the ordinary person.

,,Michael Saylor: ‚ÄúNo Reason to Sell‚Äù Bitcoin,"Bitcoin mega-whale Michael Saylor has said that there is ‚Äúno reason to sell‚Äù any of the coins held by his company Microstrategy as he would only be doing so for an inferior asset. Microstrategy currently holds 190,000 bitcoin, and there are concerns within the community about what would happen to the market if Saylor began to take profits. However, Saylor isn‚Äôt minded to shed any Microstrategy bitcoin any time soon, calling it the ‚Äúexit strategy‚Äù compared to other assets and fiat currency. Saylor made the comments to Bloomberg TV, where he emphasized MicroStrategy‚Äôs long-term commitment to holding its bitcoin reserves, suggesting that the company may never divest from its holdings. Saylor highlighted the pivotal role of spot Bitcoin ETFs in facilitating institutional capital inflows into the Bitcoin ecosystem, stating, ‚ÄúThe spot ETFs have opened up a gateway for institutional capital to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem.‚Äù He underscored the transformative impact of these ETFs on capital, with significant amounts transitioning from traditional analog assets to the digital economy daily. Saylor compared Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization, now exceeding a trillion dollars, with other traditional asset classes such as gold, real estate, and the S&P index, all of which have market capitalizations many times higher, arguing that Bitcoin‚Äôs technical superiority positions it as a superior investment option compared to these traditional assets, suggesting that capital will continue to flow into Bitcoin from other asset classes. Microstrategy‚Äôs bitcoin holdings, which stood at 190,000 at the end of January, were acquired at an average cost of $31,220 per coin. With Bitcoin‚Äôs current trading price hovering around $52,000, the company‚Äôs holdings are estimated to be worth approximately $10 billion, representing a profit of about $4 billion. Despite the considerable gains, Saylor reiterated his commitment to holding onto the cryptocurrency for the long term, stating emphatically that ‚ÄúBitcoin is the exit strategy.‚Äù BitStarz Casino Stake mBit Casino 7bit Casino True Flip Casino ",fullycrypto.com,https://fullycrypto.com/michael-saylor-no-reason-to-sell-bitcoin,Copyright ¬© 2024 FullyCrypto.

,,Redrochain.com Bitcoin Scam: Understanding the Promo Code Rip-off,"MYANTISPYWARE YOUR GO-TO DESTINATION FOR SCAM AWARENESS, MALWARE REMOVAL, ANTISPYWARE DOWNLOADS, AND EXPERT GUIDANCE February 21, 2024     No Comment     Redrochain.com is a Bitcoin scam. This scheme, widely promoted on TikTok and youTube, uses fake profiles and videos to trick users. The scammers are falsely using the names of well-known figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to make their Bitcoin promo code scheme look legitimate. However, it‚Äôs all a deception.  In this scam, TikTok users are lured into entering promo codes on Redrochain.com, which then falsely shows a Bitcoin deposit in their account. But when users try to withdraw this Bitcoin, they are tricked into paying a so-called ‚Äúactivation fee‚Äù in Bitcoin. Sadly, those who pay this fee never see their money again. Adding to the deceit, Redrochain.com has no contact information, and its website owners are hidden, as shown by a Whois lookup. The website is also a part of a larger network of scams and uses copied content, making it even more dangerous.  If you‚Äôve come across this scam or similar schemes, it‚Äôs crucial to stay informed and cautious. Read on to learn more about how to spot and avoid these types of scams. Remember, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Protect yourself and your finances by staying alert. üö® Yes, Redrochain.com is a scam! The scam claims to be a platform where you can trade digital currencies like Bitcoin. It promises quick and big profits, and even says that famous people like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Michael Saylor, Warren Buffett, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Vitalik Buterin, Cristiano Ronaldo, Mark Zuckerberg, Changpeng Zhao, Robert Kiyosaki or MrBeast are involved. However, all these promises are false, and the site is actually designed to steal your money.  We did some digging and it looks like Redrochain.com is likely part of a bigger network of scams. Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown to help you understand why you should steer clear: Redrochain.com provides no credible information about who runs the platform or where it‚Äôs based. There‚Äôs no address, phone number, or any kind of license that you‚Äôd expect from a legitimate operation. This is a big red flag: real businesses are transparent about who they are. The website even has legal pages like Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that appear to be copied from other known scam sites. The platform falsely claims that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Michael Saylor, Vitalik Buterin, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or MrBeast are backing their operation. They lure people in with made-up cryptocurrency ‚Äúgiveaways‚Äù that these celebrities are supposedly sponsoring. For example, they might say that if you sign up and deposit some money, you could win 0.32 BTC (which is a lot of money). These are all lies designed to get you to put your money into their scheme. They also use a pyramid-style referral system to get more people involved. They encourage you to share links on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The more people you bring in, the more you‚Äôre promised in rewards. But remember, pyramid schemes are illegal and unethical, and in this case, designed to trap even more victims. Once you‚Äôve put your money in, there‚Äôs no way to get it out. This is perhaps the biggest warning sign. Legitimate trading platforms will always allow you to withdraw your funds, but Redrochain.com locks your money in, essentially stealing it from you. People have tried to withdraw their investments but found that the platform simply doesn‚Äôt allow it. In summary, Redrochain.com uses tricks and lies to get people to put their money in, but once you do, you can‚Äôt get it back. They take advantage of people‚Äôs interest in digital currencies and make false promises to steal their money. It‚Äôs best to avoid Redrochain.com and any other platforms that offer quick riches or claim to have celebrity backing. Redrochain.com is just one name in a big web of fake crypto trading sites. They look different, but they‚Äôre all the same scam with the same tricks. All these sites share the same design and even the same legal pages, which shows they‚Äôre really all one big scam. The bad guys just keep making new websites to trick people into thinking it‚Äôs something new.  üòà What They Do Step-By-Step üòà The people behind Redrochain.com use social media like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to spread the scam. They make a ton of fake accounts to share links to Redrochain.com. This way, they can reach a lot of people who are excited about making money with crypto. For example, they‚Äôll post videos on TikTok showing fake giveaways and promises of big money.  They lie and say famous people like Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo, Robert Kiyosaki, Kanye West or MrBeast are part of the deal. This makes people think it‚Äôs a sure thing, but it‚Äôs all fake. They make you come to their nice-looking Redrochain.com website by clicking on links shared on social media. When you sign up, they ask for a lot of personal info like your email, phone number, and even your crypto wallet details. After signing up, they show you fake money in your account but say you have to deposit your own money first to get it out. Usually, they ask for 0.005BTC (around $200). That‚Äôs how they trap you. Once you put your money in, they lock you out and disappear. Your money and your personal information are gone, and you never get the big rewards they promised. This is how these scammers cheat people out of their hard-earned money. Be careful and avoid sites like this.  We‚Äôve put together a table of warning signs to help you spot scams like Redrochain.com. The most important red flags are at the top, so you can quickly see what to watch out for. Before you risk your money or personal info, take a look at this table. If you‚Äôve fallen prey to the Redrochain.com scam, immediate action is crucial to mitigate the damage and prevent others from becoming victims. Here‚Äôs a concise list of steps you should take right away: Cease any further deposits and refrain from sharing any more personal information with the website. Notify your bank of the unauthorized transaction. They may be able to halt the transaction or provide further steps for you to take. If you encountered scam ads on TikTok or other platforms, report them so they can be removed. TikTok: üì± Open the TikTok App, üîç Locate the Scam Ad, ‚öôÔ∏è Access More Options, üö´ Select ‚ÄòReport‚Äô. In the U.S., this would mean contacting the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov. If you‚Äôre in another country, reach out to your national consumer protection agency. Share the information on your social media accounts to alert friends, family, and followers, reducing their risk of falling for the same scam. While crypto scams like Redrochain.com are particularly concerning, they‚Äôre not the only type of online fraud you should be aware of. Here are some other common online scams to watch out for: These are emails that fake being from places you trust, like your bank. They try to trick you into giving up private info, like passwords.  Some online quizzes and games want to collect your personal info for bad reasons. Be sure to check who‚Äôs behind them and how they‚Äôll use your data.  These scams usually target people looking for work. They offer you a job but ask for money upfront for training or equipment. The job is fake, and you lose your money.  Here, fraudsters pretend to be from a tech company you know, saying your computer has a problem. They ask for payment or access to your computer to ‚Äúfix‚Äù an issue that isn‚Äôt real.  You get a message saying you‚Äôve won money or a prize but need to pay a fee first. It‚Äôs a trap; you won‚Äôt get anything.  Be cautious when buying or selling stuff online. Scammers often create fake product listings or use fake money to buy from you.  In this one, a virus locks your files and asks for money to unlock them. Be cautious about clicking on links and attachments in emails.  The Redrochain.com scam is a real eye-opener. It looks legit but it‚Äôs just a trick to get your money. And it‚Äôs not alone; there are plenty of scams out there, from fake job offers to tricky emails asking for your info. Here‚Äôs the deal: always double-check before you dive in. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look for real company details and don‚Äôt fall for flashy celebrity endorsements that aren‚Äôt real. Use this guide to spot red flags, and if you‚Äôre not sure, ask someone you trust. Scams work best when we‚Äôre quick and careless. So take your time, ask questions, and keep your money and info safe. üôèüí° AUTHOR: MYANTISPYWARE TEAM Myantispyware is an information security website created in 2004.

Furthermore, the holdings reached approximately $3.2B in unrealized profit last week. Saylor has been a longtime bull for Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency on the market. Because of this, he has led his company to invest in over 190,000 BTC. ‚ÄúBitcoin has just emerged as a trillion-dollar asset class,‚Äù Saylor added in the same interview. He compares Bitcoin to the Magnificent 7 companies, including Apple and Google. However, what he says those companies lack compared to Bitcoin is that BTC is an asset class, whereas Apple and Amazon are companies. Bitcoin is competing against Gold and the S&P, thus capital can keep flowing in, whereas the Magnificent 7 has caps.
