I\\'ve ran into another one watching various youtube videos, and all essentially depict Michael Saylor going on about a new product or service being offered for Bitcoin. It uses a video of him in his chair and AI technology to depict his voice. They\\'re about a minute long and essentially all the same. It\\'s the age old \"send x amount of bitcoin and receive double the amount back. I thought seeing one was weird, but now I\\'ve seen a couple and thought I\\'d say something to bring awareness about this. I took a screenshot of what the advertisement looks like. https://imgur.com/gallery/o6XMq5f How does this even happen on youtube? Do they not do quality control of the advertisements that they put on their platform? The scam couldn\\'t be anymore in your face, and I get you have to be pretty gullible to fall for it, but this is ridiculous. I just wanted to bring some attention to it, and apologize if it\\'s been mentioned before. Bitcoin pros & cons with related info are in the collapsed comments below.

Iâve seen this scam ad along with ones for Cardano, XRP, and Solana. I report them each time but not sure google gives a flying fuck. Honestly, they should be held liable for anyone who becomes a victim. Will probably never happen, though. There\\'s an ETH one with Vitalik as well. It\\'s almost convincing due to the fact he\\'s normally awkward as hell lol Itâs actually so fucked how theyâll de monetize creators for the smallest little infraction but let scam channels and ads run without any intervention. yt has long run ads that are blatant scams. AI has really stepped up to enable these scams too. YT needs to be taken to task for it. I never see such egregiously bad marketing on other platforms of similar size. FB had a time when they were pretty bad, but I\\'ve noticed the blatant scams are cut - or at least I don\\'t see them anymore. Maybe YouTube should step up their AI game to detect these scam ads. I\\'ve seen them all too. XRP, ADA, then the new government stimulus scam ads too. It\\'s at least 80% of ads. YouTube will take the advertising fee without vetting the company, and then once all the reports come in, they stop the advertisement and keep the money. The scammer don\\'t care because they always make it back, then rinse and repeat We haven\\'t even scratched the surface of this. Media companies better get on the fuckin ball right now. This is important. They NEED to have dedicated fact checking and digital analysis teams ready. The whole thing that Sorkin wrote about in \"The Newsroom\" Is already out of control and it\\'s gonna get exponentially worse. We need something like the Fairness Doctrine in place again and other regulations on \"opinion/entertainment networks\" when it comes to labeling them news and making sure they aren\\'t a part of the equal airtime thing We just had a post about an XRP scam a few days ago - that one was up for at least a month even though many users (me included) have reported it multiple times. The answer is: Youtube allows this as long as the advertisers pay. Scam is now part of their portfolio, or at least they told me clearly it\\'s not breaking their ToS.

Itâs unfortunate that Google looks the other way whenever a scam crypto commercial is reported on YT. Saw this too. Reported it but I\\'m sure YouTube allows these things deliberately. Spread more scam stories for bitcoin. I saw it and did the same, kinda clever to make it look live I thought. I really hope MicroStrategy complains to TY about the infringement I reported it and received a written statement within 24h, from the Google Trust & Safety-Team - their statement: this is against the Google policy and they took actionâ¦this was 4 days ago.. so it is back again? Saylor, Vitalik, Garlinghouse, Anatoli are all featured in these \"2 for 1\" advertisements on YT. I keep reporting these scam ads but nothing ever seems to happen. Thatâs what Iâve seen from the kind folks like yourself who take the time to report. Google doesnât give two shits. Maybe someone getting scammed big money and suing Google will make them reassess. I see those a lot and report them. Excellent. Have you ever received any genuine response where they took it serious and said they investigate them? Iâve seen some screen grabs where the Google rep said the ads reported didnât violate any policy. Hopefully some Google reps will take it seriously and put forth an effort to remove/ban these. Unfortunately some naive and greedy people will be taken in. No one is going to send you back double your btc...that should be obvious to everyone, but it isn\\'t. Google is pretty heavy handed with various censorship but are cool with scammers stealing not only crypto but the image of various finance and business folks without their permission(Saylor, Elon and Brad from xRP) Someone posted in this sub not too long ago after falling for this scam.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'H1Title': \"What actually is Michael Saylor's bitcoin strategy?....\", 'H2Title': '', 'H3Title': '', 'content': \" ....being more specific than just saying he's accumulating as much bitcoin as he can. I Googled it but can only find pieces of it. he stepped down from ceo last year, but at the time he was the longest sitting ceo of a single corporation in wall st history. heâs shared stories of seeing ceos destroy companies by trying to beat inflation and stay profitable by buying companies, merging with companies, buying back stocks etc. when covid happened and the money printer went brrrrr he realized that no matter what he did, microstrategy was in a dire situation in that no matter how many hours he asked his employees to work or how many employees he hired, they could not keep making more profits to beat inflation since the money they earn and saved was being devalued. so he did a drastic move and went all in on bitcoin which cannot be manipulated or devalued. in todayâs economic environment no one can beat inflation with their income alone, they need to take risks like invest in the stock market, buy real estate, have a side gig etc. corporations are in the same boat, they need to merge with other companies, buy other companies or buyback stocks etc. but as i explained those generally destroy corporations in the long run. so saylorâs strategy using his own metaphor is to stop fighting the wind of inflation by paddling harder and instead put up a sail (bitcoin) and harness the wind. bitcoin is volatile but as he says âvolatility is vitalityâ meaning fiat is stable but is guaranteed to go to zero due to infinite printing whereas bitcoin is volatile but is guaranteed to go up in value due to itâs strictly limited supply. Is part of his strategy to issue more stock that is immediately sold to buy bitcoin? Heâs also established MSTR as a better than ETF option for institutions that canât legally buy BTC but want exposure to BTC; They buy his stock. His massive purchases of late are to fend off the actual ETF issuers. MSTR likely to take a haircut in its stock price when the ETFs hit. He wants to be able to give someone more exposure for less fees by just holding MSTR vs iBTC. I think it was a simple mathematical calculation for Michael. He calculated the true cost of capital was above 20% unlike what the government was claiming inflation was. He realized that if you're not making >20% APY then you are losing purchasing power. The only thing that has a chance of beating 20% is BTC. One thing no commenter has mentioned yet is that microstrategy is issuing shares of stock that people purchase in fiat and then MSTR is using that fiat to purchase Bitcoin. Itâs basically the same concept if you taking out a personal loan to buy bitcoin and then paying off the loan when the bitcoin appreciates.  Buy and hold, because nothing will have a greater value than bitcoin. He believes it i do too maybe we are both fools, I dont think we are.

It wonât be from a Bitcoin\\ngiveaway on YouTube. Michael Saylor, founder of cloud software company MicroStrategy, issued a warning on Twitter this week regarding the rise of AI-powered deepfake scams aimed at stealing cryptocurrency from credulous YouTube viewers. \"There is no risk-free way to double your Bitcoin, and MicroStrategy doesn\\'t give away BTC to those who scan a barcode,\" Saylor tweeted. \"My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don\\'t trust, verify,\" he tweeted. â ï¸ Warning â ï¸ There is no risk-free way to double your #bitcoin, and @MicroStrategy doesn\\'t give away $BTC to those who scan a barcode. My team takes down about 80 fake AI-generated @YouTube videos every day, but the scammers keep launching more. Don\\'t trust, verify. pic.twitter.com/gqZkQW02Ji â Michael Saylorâ¡ï¸ (@saylor) January 13, 2024  MicroStrategy, under Saylor\\'s leadership, has become synonymous with Bitcoin, amassing more of the cryptocurrency than any other publicly traded company. It now holds over $8 billion worth of BTC, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. Saylor\\'s advocacy for Bitcoin\\'s use and adoption has been unwavering, often voicing his support in media interviewsâmany of which are clipped and redistributed across YouTube. The scam he referred to in his warning is all too common in crypto: fraudsters often impersonate notable figures and trick viewers or social-media followers into sending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to an unfamiliar address with the promise of receiving more in return. These scams reached a peak when verified accounts of high-profile individuals like Elon Musk were hacked to disseminate similar fraudulent schemes. In 2020, a teen hacked the Twitter accounts of celebrities like Elon Musk and duped victims out of more than $100,000 worth of bitcoin using fake tweets promising bitcoin rewards. But scammers have now upped the ante through the use of AI and deepfake tech, making these schemes more difficult to detect. And YouTube seemingly canât keep up. Deepfakes, a form of synthetic media powered by AI algorithms, allow for the creation of convincing fake videos and imagery that depicts events or speech that never actually occurred. As Saylor notes, videos using deepfake technology to impersonate him and other crypto personalities have proliferated on YouTube and social media platforms. These videos aim to convince viewers to send crypto to a provided address under the pretense that they will receive double the amount in return. Video altering is a common scam in the crypto world, with major social media hacks in the past further demonstrating the technique\\'s potential dangers. Even basic schemes like those using previously recorded podcasts to create deceptive viral content are increasingly being weaponized to perpetrate scams, especially on platforms like YouTube. There, videos featuring major crypto personalities like Elon Musk, Brad Garlinghouse, Michael Saylor, and Vitalik Buterin are fabricated to resemble real-time streams, luring viewers into financial traps, like the one Saylor mentioned. While platforms like YouTube work to take down AI-generated scam videos, the technology used to create deceptive content continues to improve. Now, video deepfakes, generative video, AI voice cloning and even real time AI translations are possible with just a few clicks. With crypto criminals getting better at producing convincing fake videos, and AI technology advancing rapidly, it\\'s more important than ever to verify rather than blindly trust unexpected crypto-related offers online.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'H1Title': 'Michael Saylor warns of deepfake crypto scams involving MicroStrategy', 'H2Title': '', 'H3Title': '', 'content': 'English                                    The recent surge in cryptocurrency giveaway scams has raised concerns, particularly with the involvement of deepfake videos featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. These scams, utilizing AI-generated content, are prevalent on platforms such as YouTube and X, with notable personalities like Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also becoming targets. Michael Saylor recently issued a warning after discovering fraudulent deepfake videos circulating on YouTube, falsely portraying him and MicroStrategy engaging in a Bitcoin giveaway. In these videos, the deepfake Saylor encourages viewers to send him Bitcoin, promising to double the amount. Saylor responded to this deceptive tactic by cautioning his followers, emphasizing the absence of a âfree lunchâ in the cryptocurrency space. The misleading video not only promotes the fake giveaway. They also make audacious claims, including predicting that the approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would drive the price of BTC to an astonishing $1 million. Those who click on the video link are directed to a scam website claiming to host the âbiggest crypto giveaway,â boasting 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH up for grabs. The website employs urgency, urging immediate participation with limited spots available and no prerequisite crypto knowledge. The deceptive website outlines the event, promising participants a share of 1,000 BTC and 10,000 ETH, emphasizing exclusivity with the statement, âYou can only participate once!â The deepfake Saylor on the site encourages investors to scan a QR code, ostensibly leading to the giveaway. It is noteworthy that Michael Saylor recently disclosed plans to sell $216 million worth of MicroStrategy shares to bolster his Bitcoin holdings. While the exact amount of BTC he currently owns remains undisclosed, Saylor shared in October 2020 that he possesses 17,732 BTC. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy, the software intelligence firm under Saylorâs leadership, publicly reported holdings of 189,150 bitcoins as of December 2023. The prevalence of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts underscores a growing trend in the misuse of AI-generated content. These scams exploit the trust and credibility associated with influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry to deceive unsuspecting individuals. Investors are urged to exercise caution and skepticism when confronted with sensational claims or promises of free cryptocurrency. The saying âthere is no such thing as a free lunchâ resonates particularly in the volatile and often deceptive realm of cryptocurrencies. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of verifying information, especially in an environment where misinformation and fraudulent schemes abound. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, so does the creativity of scammers seeking to exploit the enthusiasm surrounding these digital assets. The rise of deepfake scams targeting cryptocurrency investors, featuring influential figures like Michael Saylor, highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance within the community. Read More One of the largest international banks on the planet, Standard Chartered has recently predicted that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank stated those funds could be seen in 2024, following approval of the investment product. Industry experts have increased their expectations of the productâs approval in the coming days, with many expecting approval to arrive by Wednesday of this week. Moreover, Standard Chartered has forecasted a massive price increase for the digital asset following approval of the more than a dozen spot Bitcoin ETF applications that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently contemplating. JUST IN: Standard Charter Bank says #Bitcoin could see $50-100 billion in spot ETF inflows upon approval in 2024. Also Read: Bitcoin: Standard Chartered Says ETF to Bring 165% Gain in 2024 For the last several months, anticipation over a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States has reached a fever pitch. The digital asset industry is anxiously awaiting a decision on the host of applications. Subsequently, many are predicting what such an approval could mean for the industry as a whole. Among them is Standard Chartered Bank, which says that Bitcoin could see as much as $100 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. Specifically, the bank notes that the inflows will be between $50 and $100 billion. Additionally, they expect a massive impact on the price over the next year. Also Read: All Spot Bitcoin ETF Applicants Submit S-1 Final Amendments The bank also noted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $200,000 by the end of 2025. Although it would certainly require the Spot Bitcoin ETF approval, it would be a monumental increase. Subsequently, that mark would skyrocket past Bitcoinâs previous all-time high of $68,789. The expectation from those within the industry is that approval is set to arrive at some point this week. Standard Chartered noted that such an approval is imminent in their predictions. Conversely, the deadline for a decision has long been observed as January 10th.
