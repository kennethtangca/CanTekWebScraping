      "{'authors': ' Thomas Orsolya', 'date': ' December 20, 2023', 'title': 'Don’t Get Scammed By The Fake Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway', 'content': 'A fraudulent online campaign claiming beloved actress Jennifer Aniston is gifting free MacBook laptops has recently infiltrated social media through manipulated video ads and questionable website portals. However, the supposed giveaway actually intends stealing personal information and money rather than magnanimous charity. This article will break down exactly how the devious scam ensnares victims step-by-step alongside protection tips to avoid potential damages.   This Article Contains: A fraudulent online campaign claiming universally-beloved comedy icon Jennifer Aniston has teamed up with Apple facilitating an epic giveaway gifting free MacBook laptops aims exploiting fans through deception and psychological manipulation rather than reasonable charity. The scam commonly starts circulating via video advertisements run across social platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube featuring deepfake AI footage realistically depicting Aniston endorsing the exclusive holiday promotion. “Hey guys, Jennifer Aniston here with some exciting news!” the simulated ads show Aniston cheerfully sharing behind a MacBook bearing her branded logo. “To celebrate the holidays this year, I’ve partnered with Apple to give away THOUSANDS of the gorgeous rose gold MacBook Airs totally free!” The fabricated Aniston representation urges viewers act fast clicking onscreen links claiming offer details revealing MacBook ownership pending only small $2 voucher fees. “Meet our previous giveaway winners and learn how to participate yourself before remaining inventory runs out!” fake Aniston declares pointing at 11 smiling purported laptop recipients beside her. “Hurry and click below to take our eligibility quiz now because only limited supply still remains!” Enticed social media users then click personalized tracking links expecting official Apple contest pages. However, redirects route victims through a series of external phishing websites like “jettrainingworld.com” completely unrelated to Apple or Ms. Aniston’s official businesses. Deceptive portal pages feature familiar MacBook branding and imagery aiming to perpetuate initial perceptions around the free laptop giveaway rather than raising skepticism. Website headers exclaim: “3499 Rose Gold MacBook Airs Still Available to Ship for Holiday Giveaway Participants – Meet Previous Winners!” Sprinkled amid the hype, fake customer testimonials like Jordan Blum’s suspicious smiling review lend perceived credibility implying he successfully participated: “I just got it and it is amazing! Can’t believe I got this for basically free! What a STEAL.” But the manufactured social proof aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. In reality, buried terms and conditions eventually disclose victims submitting entry forms and processing fees actually consent steep recurring subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than securing free MacBook prizes. The scam simply intends stealing money and information rather than reasonably gifting laptops worth over $1,000. By recognizing manipulative hooks early explaining unbelievable “free” gifts tied to respected brands require temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, improved vigilance best avoids falling prey themselves. The fraudulent Jennifer Aniston MacBook giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims systematically through the following deceptive process: The scam starts by using AI deepfake videos to falsely portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extravagant holiday giveaway of free MacBook laptops to a select group of social media fans who enter in time. This familiar celebrity face grabs initial attention and triggers shares spreading wider reach. Clicking on misleading video captions and embedded URL links reroutes viewers outside platforms to elaborate intermediate scam portal pages completely unassociated with Apple or the real Jennifer Aniston. These showcase the Apple MacBook icon plus more AI-generated imagery of Aniston furthering initial impressions around the giveaway’s perceived legitimacy and exclusivity. Sprinkled among portal pages, fake customer reviews and stock model images smiling beside shipped boxes build false social proof implying previous contest winners already successfully received expensive Apple laptops simply covering delivery fees. “I just got it and it is amazing!” reads a suspicious account attributed to Jordan Blum. “What a STEAL.” But the fabricated hype aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. The false scarcity, celebrity endorsement, urgency cues and social proof elements compel desired actions outside rational thought. When visitors attempt securing devices through order forms, extensive personalized questionnaires conveniently require private input exceeding reasonable needs identifying shipping locations. Hidden fine print passages encased within lengthy website terms and conditions associated with giveaway order forms reveal victims actually consent steep recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time product shipments. Once scam operators possess compromised confidential information, recurring credit card charges activate alongside potentials reselling data through unregulated dark web channels inflicting additional long-term damages through identity theft. Either generates long-term financial injuries inflicted upon manipulation victims falling for fictional celebrity-fronted contests leaving them utterly empty-handed. The supposed Jennifer Aniston free MacBook giveaway flows heavily through major social media channels like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated video content and other deception tactics targeting users. Let’s review what suspicious signals commonly expose the too-good-to-be-true laptop promotion on each platform. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common problems: Specifically, glossy video spots insisting Jennifer Aniston has gifted MacBook Airs to random followers deserves heavy skepticism vetting truthfulness. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to supposed free MacBook offers: For example, a brand new Instagram profile for “JenniferAnistonRamirez” regularly posting about MacBook sweepstakes entry from Nigeria seems reasonably dubious. Scrutinize these indicators TikTok videos likely intend socially engineering increased MacBook scam participation: When grand opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good be true often is. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites to help lend credibility justifying later requests for personal user information. Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate Apple’s iconic branding without legal rights or permissions. Logos, product images and even pricing copies real MacBook listings aiming to dupe visitors initially believing observation legitimate authorized retailer online storefronts. Another effective tactic giving the illusion of third-party endorsement involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes praising the epic giveaway values. But scrutinizing these message statements against credible media archives reveals no records correlating to actual endorsement press releases. For example, sites proclaim: “I absolutely love my rose gold MacBook Air for streaming ‘The Morning Show’ from anywhere!” says attributed Jennifer Aniston quote. “So excited watch fans unbox their very own new laptops TikTok this holiday season after entering our biggest tech giveaway ever!” But misinforming visitors intends lowering guard requesting financial disclosures rather than transparency reasonably offering extravagant free gifts in exchange for little. While flashy incentives prompt acting before thoroughly reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages disclose victims registering for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges rather than one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus giveaways. Finally, running themes across scam websites stay hiding the true controlling parties through obscuring domain registration data behind proxy site ownership protections rather than providing visible legitimate business details. So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected celebrity status tempt likelihood engagement, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages. Remain empowered spotting past emotional hooks and facade obscuring ulterior motives. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting seemingly legitimate giveaways or free trials, here are proactive next steps: Contact any credit card, debit card or digital wallet providers tied to scam payments alerting them you discovered an appliance scam scheme falsely claiming celebrity endorsement used as pretext enabling undisclosed monthly account charges without consent. Inform them this violates expected giveaway terms outlined involving only reasonable one-time voucher shipment-related costs. Ask urgently about launching fraud disputes and request provisional reimbursements until resolved. Supply details on the offending business names, domains or parent companies behind recurring charges. Follow their guidance strengthening cases demonstrating damages incurred under demonstrably deceptive pretenses. Collect customer service contact information from monthly billing statements tied to scam services and subscriptions. Call each provider clearly revoking any past payment authorization now aware those were based on false representations and predatory concealment rather than reasonable sweepstakes disclosure terms initially pitched. Record confirmation details should charges inexplicably continue. Since compromised sensitive information remains exploited repeatedly, immediately update passwords, security answers and enable stronger multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible across pertinent logins. Additionally, update contact email addresses and phone numbers previously provided fraudsters. Turn on credit monitoring services alerting suspicious activities and consider proactive bureau notifyers or credit freezes as well limiting potential exacerbated cases identity theft result these data breaches. File reports about all offending companies and scam portals with both government and third-party consumer protection groups like the Federal Trade Commission, FBI Cybercrime Division or Internet Crime Complaint Center documenting damages incurred under demonstrably false pretenses. Such filings support investigating the broader interstate patterns of repeat offenders ultimately improving outcomes and recovery options for all negatively affected victims. The more meticulously detailed records submitted, the greater potentials agencies can assemble civil cases achieving criminal restitution. so collect and preserve all evidence exposing scam techniques, weblinks, names or contact points. Although highly convincing initially, several consistent suspicious signals help reveal when tech product celebrity giveaways truly intend facilitating malicious financial theft rather than reasonable community goodwill or marketing lead generations: 1. Unsubstantiated Celebrity Endorsement Claims 2. Urgency Tactics Incentivizing Haste Over Logic 3. Account Irregularities Among Key Promoters 4. External Website Links Rerouting Followers Through Unvetted Domains 5. Mismatched Fine Print Terms Covering Monthly Subscriptions vs One-Time Voucher Payments 6. Deliberately Obscured Domain Ownership and Operational Details When celebrities magically announce extraordinary free gift opportunities tied closely incredible true stories conveniently requiring temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, rational skepticism questions whether purely hearts desires motivating such grand generosity or ulterior motives focused self-enrichment. Maintain vigilant common-sense guardrails. Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions around supposed Jennifer Aniston sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seeming to portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extraordinary MacBook giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam aiming to phish peoples’ sensitive credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free. No reputable evidence supports the famous actress has ever facilitated any such laptop contests. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely showing Jennifer Aniston endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, external portal pages mimic official Apple branding alongside urges creating urgency to compel desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering product shipment. And fake customer testimonials create “herd mentality” assumption it must prove legitimate if many others already participated successfully before. No rational reason exists reasonably explaining why a celebrity would gift total strangers thousand dollar laptops simply for covering minor shipping and handling logistics alone. It defies logical assumptions. While certainly possible in coordinated future marketing campaigns, supposed existing viral MacBook contests fronted by Ms. Aniston instead represent third-party scam attempts trying to abuse public goodwill towards subtly advancing personal agendas causing harm. Despite flashy incentives promising free MacBook laptops to lucky social media followers attempting order processes, victims never receive devices. However, buried terms disclose signing up for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable single shipment fees. Those discovering unauthorized charges or services appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity tech giveaways should first notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions, shutdown compromised account access then report details to appropriate government and consumer protection groups exposing shady business practices. The supposed Jennifer Aniston-gifted MacBook giveaway sweeping social media demonstrates another cautionary example why reasonable skepticism remains so crucial navigating today’s riskier online waters promising extraordinary free gifts wrapped too perfectly almost be true. What seems incredible likely is until proper independent verification completed first. Don’t compromise personal information or finances chasing irrational social media opportunities down rabbit holes detached from reality. Apply critical thought before acting. And warn others similarly avoiding unnecessary troubles initially inspired by hope beyond reason. If extraordinary marketing gifted celebrities offerings appear flooding feeds, don’t assume automatic honesty or accuracy. Deductive logic and externally validated proof separates intents aimed self-enrichment from genuine goodwill. Here are 10 basic security tips to help you avoid malware and protect your device: Use a good antivirus and keep it up-to-date. It\\'s essential to use a good quality antivirus and keep it up-to-date to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats. We are huge fans of Malwarebytes Premium and use it on all of our devices, including Windows and Mac computers as well as our mobile devices. Malwarebytes sits beside your traditional antivirus, filling in any gaps in its defenses, and providing extra protection against sneakier security threats. Keep software and operating systems up-to-date. Keep your operating system and apps up to date. Whenever an update is released for your device, download and install it right away. These updates often include security fixes, vulnerability patches, and other necessary maintenance. Be careful when installing programs and apps. Pay close attention to installation screens and license agreements when installing software. Custom or advanced installation options will often disclose any third-party software that is also being installed. Take great care in every stage of the process and make sure you know what it is you\\'re agreeing to before you click \"Next.\" Install an ad blocker. Use a browser-based content blocker, like AdGuard. Content blockers help stop malicious ads, Trojans, phishing, and other undesirable content that an antivirus product alone may not stop. Be careful what you download. A top goal of cybercriminals is to trick you into downloading malware—programs or apps that carry malware or try to steal information. This malware can be disguised as an app: anything from a popular game to something that checks traffic or the weather. Be alert for people trying to trick you. Whether it\\'s your email, phone, messenger, or other applications, always be alert and on guard for someone trying to trick you into clicking on links or replying to messages. Remember that it\\'s easy to spoof phone numbers, so a familiar name or number doesn\\'t make messages more trustworthy. Back up your data. Back up your data frequently and check that your backup data can be restored. You can do this manually on an external HDD/USB stick, or automatically using backup software. This is also the best way to counter ransomware. Never connect the backup drive to a computer if you suspect that the computer is infected with malware. Choose strong passwords. Use strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using personal information or easily guessable words in your passwords. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don\\'t use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it\\'s important to follow these 10 basic safety rules. By doing so, you can protect yourself from many of the unpleasant surprises that can arise when using the web.

However, the supposed giveaway actually intends stealing personal information and money rather than magnanimous charity. This article will break down exactly how the devious scam ensnares victims step-by-step alongside protection tips to avoid potential damages.   This Article Contains: A fraudulent online campaign claiming universally-beloved comedy icon Jennifer Aniston has teamed up with Apple facilitating an epic giveaway gifting free MacBook laptops aims exploiting fans through deception and psychological manipulation rather than reasonable charity. The scam commonly starts circulating via video advertisements run across social platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube featuring deepfake AI footage realistically depicting Aniston endorsing the exclusive holiday promotion. “Hey guys, Jennifer Aniston here with some exciting news!” the simulated ads show Aniston cheerfully sharing behind a MacBook bearing her branded logo. “To celebrate the holidays this year, I’ve partnered with Apple to give away THOUSANDS of the gorgeous rose gold MacBook Airs totally free!” The fabricated Aniston representation urges viewers act fast clicking onscreen links claiming offer details revealing MacBook ownership pending only small $2 voucher fees. “Meet our previous giveaway winners and learn how to participate yourself before remaining inventory runs out!” fake Aniston declares pointing at 11 smiling purported laptop recipients beside her. “Hurry and click below to take our eligibility quiz now because only limited supply still remains!” Enticed social media users then click personalized tracking links expecting official Apple contest pages. However, redirects route victims through a series of external phishing websites like “jettrainingworld.com” completely unrelated to Apple or Ms. Aniston’s official businesses. Deceptive portal pages feature familiar MacBook branding and imagery aiming to perpetuate initial perceptions around the free laptop giveaway rather than raising skepticism. Website headers exclaim: “3499 Rose Gold MacBook Airs Still Available to Ship for Holiday Giveaway Participants – Meet Previous Winners!” Sprinkled amid the hype, fake customer testimonials like Jordan Blum’s suspicious smiling review lend perceived credibility implying he successfully participated: “I just got it and it is amazing! Can’t believe I got this for basically free! What a STEAL.” But the manufactured social proof aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. In reality, buried terms and conditions eventually disclose victims submitting entry forms and processing fees actually consent steep recurring subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than securing free MacBook prizes. The scam simply intends stealing money and information rather than reasonably gifting laptops worth over $1,000. By recognizing manipulative hooks early explaining unbelievable “free” gifts tied to respected brands require temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, improved vigilance best avoids falling prey themselves. The fraudulent Jennifer Aniston MacBook giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims systematically through the following deceptive process: The scam starts by using AI deepfake videos to falsely portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extravagant holiday giveaway of free MacBook laptops to a select group of social media fans who enter in time. This familiar celebrity face grabs initial attention and triggers shares spreading wider reach. Clicking on misleading video captions and embedded URL links reroutes viewers outside platforms to elaborate intermediate scam portal pages completely unassociated with Apple or the real Jennifer Aniston. These showcase the Apple MacBook icon plus more AI-generated imagery of Aniston furthering initial impressions around the giveaway’s perceived legitimacy and exclusivity. Sprinkled among portal pages, fake customer reviews and stock model images smiling beside shipped boxes build false social proof implying previous contest winners already successfully received expensive Apple laptops simply covering delivery fees. “I just got it and it is amazing!” reads a suspicious account attributed to Jordan Blum. “What a STEAL.” But the fabricated hype aims overcoming logic questioning how such contests reasonably sustain mass distribution thousand dollar devices requesting only couple dollar shipping in return. The false scarcity, celebrity endorsement, urgency cues and social proof elements compel desired actions outside rational thought. When visitors attempt securing devices through order forms, extensive personalized questionnaires conveniently require private input exceeding reasonable needs identifying shipping locations. Hidden fine print passages encased within lengthy website terms and conditions associated with giveaway order forms reveal victims actually consent steep recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time product shipments. Once scam operators possess compromised confidential information, recurring credit card charges activate alongside potentials reselling data through unregulated dark web channels inflicting additional long-term damages through identity theft. Either generates long-term financial injuries inflicted upon manipulation victims falling for fictional celebrity-fronted contests leaving them utterly empty-handed. The supposed Jennifer Aniston free MacBook giveaway flows heavily through major social media channels like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated video content and other deception tactics targeting users. Let’s review what suspicious signals commonly expose the too-good-to-be-true laptop promotion on each platform. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common problems: Specifically, glossy video spots insisting Jennifer Aniston has gifted MacBook Airs to random followers deserves heavy skepticism vetting truthfulness. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to supposed free MacBook offers: For example, a brand new Instagram profile for “JenniferAnistonRamirez” regularly posting about MacBook sweepstakes entry from Nigeria seems reasonably dubious. Scrutinize these indicators TikTok videos likely intend socially engineering increased MacBook scam participation: When grand opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good be true often is. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites to help lend credibility justifying later requests for personal user information. Let’s explore several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate Apple’s iconic branding without legal rights or permissions. Logos, product images and even pricing copies real MacBook listings aiming to dupe visitors initially believing observation legitimate authorized retailer online storefronts. Another effective tactic giving the illusion of third-party endorsement involves crafting vivid celebrity quotes praising the epic giveaway values. But scrutinizing these message statements against credible media archives reveals no records correlating to actual endorsement press releases. For example, sites proclaim: “I absolutely love my rose gold MacBook Air for streaming ‘The Morning Show’ from anywhere!” says attributed Jennifer Aniston quote. “So excited watch fans unbox their very own new laptops TikTok this holiday season after entering our biggest tech giveaway ever!” But misinforming visitors intends lowering guard requesting financial disclosures rather than transparency reasonably offering extravagant free gifts in exchange for little. While flashy incentives prompt acting before thoroughly reviewing rules, buried terms and conditions passages disclose victims registering for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges rather than one-time coupon shipping fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrates intention eliciting finances deceptively versus giveaways. Finally, running themes across scam websites stay hiding the true controlling parties through obscuring domain registration data behind proxy site ownership protections rather than providing visible legitimate business details. So while unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected celebrity status tempt likelihood engagement, applying extra scrutiny protects individuals from preventable privacy and financial damages. Remain empowered spotting past emotional hooks and facade obscuring ulterior motives. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting seemingly legitimate giveaways or free trials, here are proactive next steps: Contact any credit card, debit card or digital wallet providers tied to scam payments alerting them you discovered an appliance scam scheme falsely claiming celebrity endorsement used as pretext enabling undisclosed monthly account charges without consent. Inform them this violates expected giveaway terms outlined involving only reasonable one-time voucher shipment-related costs. Ask urgently about launching fraud disputes and request provisional reimbursements until resolved. Supply details on the offending business names, domains or parent companies behind recurring charges. Follow their guidance strengthening cases demonstrating damages incurred under demonstrably deceptive pretenses. Collect customer service contact information from monthly billing statements tied to scam services and subscriptions. Call each provider clearly revoking any past payment authorization now aware those were based on false representations and predatory concealment rather than reasonable sweepstakes disclosure terms initially pitched. Record confirmation details should charges inexplicably continue. Since compromised sensitive information remains exploited repeatedly, immediately update passwords, security answers and enable stronger multi-factor authentication everywhere feasible across pertinent logins. Additionally, update contact email addresses and phone numbers previously provided fraudsters. Turn on credit monitoring services alerting suspicious activities and consider proactive bureau notifyers or credit freezes as well limiting potential exacerbated cases identity theft result these data breaches. File reports about all offending companies and scam portals with both government and third-party consumer protection groups like the Federal Trade Commission, FBI Cybercrime Division or Internet Crime Complaint Center documenting damages incurred under demonstrably false pretenses. Such filings support investigating the broader interstate patterns of repeat offenders ultimately improving outcomes and recovery options for all negatively affected victims. The more meticulously detailed records submitted, the greater potentials agencies can assemble civil cases achieving criminal restitution. so collect and preserve all evidence exposing scam techniques, weblinks, names or contact points. Although highly convincing initially, several consistent suspicious signals help reveal when tech product celebrity giveaways truly intend facilitating malicious financial theft rather than reasonable community goodwill or marketing lead generations: 1. Unsubstantiated Celebrity Endorsement Claims 2. Urgency Tactics Incentivizing Haste Over Logic 3. Account Irregularities Among Key Promoters 4. External Website Links Rerouting Followers Through Unvetted Domains 5. Mismatched Fine Print Terms Covering Monthly Subscriptions vs One-Time Voucher Payments 6. Deliberately Obscured Domain Ownership and Operational Details When celebrities magically announce extraordinary free gift opportunities tied closely incredible true stories conveniently requiring temporarily relinquishing sensitive identity data first, rational skepticism questions whether purely hearts desires motivating such grand generosity or ulterior motives focused self-enrichment. Maintain vigilant common-sense guardrails. Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions around supposed Jennifer Aniston sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring convincing video footage seeming to portray Jennifer Aniston personally endorsing an extraordinary MacBook giveaway for fans, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam aiming to phish peoples’ sensitive credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free. No reputable evidence supports the famous actress has ever facilitated any such laptop contests. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely showing Jennifer Aniston endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, external portal pages mimic official Apple branding alongside urges creating urgency to compel desired actions outside reasoned thought. Dense terms and conditions bury monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonably covering product shipment. And fake customer testimonials create “herd mentality” assumption it must prove legitimate if many others already participated successfully before. No rational reason exists reasonably explaining why a celebrity would gift total strangers thousand dollar laptops simply for covering minor shipping and handling logistics alone. It defies logical assumptions. While certainly possible in coordinated future marketing campaigns, supposed existing viral MacBook contests fronted by Ms. Aniston instead represent third-party scam attempts trying to abuse public goodwill towards subtly advancing personal agendas causing harm. Despite flashy incentives promising free MacBook laptops to lucky social media followers attempting order processes, victims never receive devices. However, buried terms disclose signing up for expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable single shipment fees. Those discovering unauthorized charges or services appearing after attempting too good to be true celebrity tech giveaways should first notify associated banking and credit sources disputing transactions, shutdown compromised account access then report details to appropriate government and consumer protection groups exposing shady business practices. The supposed Jennifer Aniston-gifted MacBook giveaway sweeping social media demonstrates another cautionary example why reasonable skepticism remains so crucial navigating today’s riskier online waters promising extraordinary free gifts wrapped too perfectly almost be true. What seems incredible likely is until proper independent verification completed first. Don’t compromise personal information or finances chasing irrational social media opportunities down rabbit holes detached from reality. Apply critical thought before acting. And warn others similarly avoiding unnecessary troubles initially inspired by hope beyond reason. If extraordinary marketing gifted celebrities offerings appear flooding feeds, don’t assume automatic honesty or accuracy. Deductive logic and externally validated proof separates intents aimed self-enrichment from genuine goodwill.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': ' Feb 17,2024', 'title': 'Unveiling the Deceptive Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam', 'content': '                     In today\\'s digital age, scams and fraudulent activities have become increasingly prevalent. From phishing emails to fake online giveaways, it\\'s important to stay vigilant and aware of the tactics scammers employ. One such scam that has gained traction is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway. In this article, we will delve into the details of this deceptive scheme, uncover the tactics used to trick unsuspecting users, and shed light on the role of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram in promoting such scams. So, let\\'s dive in and unravel the truth behind this elaborate ruse. The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a scam that claims to offer lucky participants the chance to obtain a MacBook Pro for just $2. However, this supposed \"giveaway\" is nothing more than a ploy to trick people into parting with their money. The scam typically begins with an enticing advertisement featuring Jennifer Aniston\\'s image and false claims of being the \"largest MacBook Pro giveaway in the world.\" To claim the prize, users are instructed to click on a link provided. The scammers behind the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway employ deceptive tactics to lure unsuspecting users into their trap. One such tactic is the use of deepfake technology to create realistic lip movements in the video advertisement. This further enhances the illusion and makes it difficult for users to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent content. Additionally, the scammers often use popular celebrity endorsements, like Kelly Clarkson, to give their scams a sense of legitimacy. It is disheartening to note that platforms like Facebook and Instagram, owned by Meta, have played a significant role in enabling scams and fraudulent activities. Despite claiming to be serious about combating scams, these platforms continue to accept advertisements from scammers, prioritizing profits over user safety. Their lax approach to ad review and acceptance of money from anyone has made it easier for scammers to reach a wider audience and perpetrate their deceitful schemes. It is essential to clarify that Jennifer Aniston has no involvement in the MacBook Pro Giveaway scam. Her image and likeness are being used without permission to deceive unsuspecting users. The scammers behind this scheme capitalize on her popularity and fame to make their scam appear more credible and enticing. Jennifer Aniston is likely completely unaware of her association with this fraudulent activity. One of the key tactics employed by scammers in this scheme is the concealment of hidden subscription charges. Users who click on the advertisement are directed to a website where they are prompted to answer a series of questions. Upon completion, they are informed that they have won the MacBook Pro. However, buried within the terms and conditions lies the revelation that participants are agreeing to pay a substantial amount of $29.97 as a guaranteed placement fee, which is far from the initially advertised $2 price. Scammers rely on users\\' tendencies to overlook terms and conditions to trap them in their deceptive scheme. In the case of the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, the terms and conditions state that participants willingly agree to pay the aforementioned placement fee of $29.97. Unfortunately, many users fail to read the fine print, leading them to believe they have won a valuable prize when, in reality, they have unwittingly signed up for an expensive subscription. The initial allure of obtaining a MacBook Pro for only $2 quickly dissipates as the true cost of the scam reveals itself. Participants are not only misled into paying a large placement fee but also find themselves enrolled in a monthly subscription service, where additional charges may be levied. The lack of transparency in the advertisement and the intentionally convoluted terms and conditions serve to exploit users\\' trust and maximize the scammers\\' profits. The prevalence of scams like the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway underscores the urgency for social media platforms to adopt stricter moderation policies and regulations. Manual review processes and capable moderators should be employed to evaluate and remove fraudulent advertisements promptly. Only by taking proactive measures to combat scams can these platforms ensure the safety and trust of their users. In conclusion, the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a deceptive scam aimed at manipulating users into paying exorbitant fees under the false pretense of winning a valuable prize. The advertisement tactics, Facebook and Instagram\\'s complicity, and the hidden subscription charges all contribute to the success of this fraudulent scheme. It is crucial for users to remain vigilant and skeptical when presented with such enticing offers, always taking the time to thoroughly read the terms and conditions. With increased moderation and user awareness, we can collectively strive to protect against these scams and create a safer digital landscape. Q1: Is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway legitimate? A1: No, it is a deceptive scam that tricks users into paying hidden fees. Q2: How do scammers use celebrity endorsements in their scams?

However, the supposed giveaway actually intends stealing personal information and money rather than reasonable contest generosity or inventory liquidation. This article exposes the deceitful scam strategies step-by-step alongside guidance protecting yourself from potential damages. This Article Contains: The increasingly common, yet fake, Apple MacBook giveaway scam starts by circulating online ads featuring exciting headlines like: “Apple is offering 1 MacBook per household in US after a lawsuit over misleading advertising prices. Answer a few questions to check if you qualify and fill out a form to get yours delivered.” Hopeful social media users then click embedded links or tap targeted advertisements expecting official Apple contest pages. However, redirects route victims through a series of elaborate external phishing websites like “inducive.info” and”topwinnersofficial.com” completely unassociated with Apple. Decoy portal pages prominently display reputable news site logos like Fox, CNN or People Magazine alongside Apple imagery. This aims lending initial legitimacy justifying later requests for sensitive personal information rather than raising skepticism. Website headers blare: “Apple Partners With Marketplaces For Unbelievable MacBook Giveaway! Up To 100% Off!” After scrolling through fake inventory liquidation cover stories and customer testimonials, visitors eventually reach customized order forms promising delivery of free laptops solely pending small $6.95 upfront shipping/handling fees. However, buried fine print passages encased within lengthy terms and conditions associated with order forms actually bind victims to expensive recurring monthly subscription charges exceeding $100 rather than one-time voucher payments expected. In the end, high value Apple products are never dispatched to filling contest entries. But victims’ compromised information enables scammers inflicting financial damages through underground dark web data sale channels. The fraudulent Apple MacBook giveaway conducts highly coordinated strategies luring victims systematically through the following deceptive process: The scam starts by circulating fake ads across social platforms urgently insisting Apple urgently liquidates inventory through unbelievable deals benefiting random followers upgrading devices essentially free. Clicking on social media links or videos reroutes viewers outside platforms to elaborate phishing portal pages like “foxlimiteds.com” impersonating trusted news brands. These feature Apple’s iconic logo and imagery while deploying additional manipulation triggers overcoming initial skepticism. False inventory liquidation narratives lend believable context rationalizing extraordinary free device offers tied to reasonable request small $6.95 delivery reimbursements giving the deal perceived credibility. Fake customer reviews and claims of extreme limited supply bypass critical thinking and compel desired actions reactively seeking scarce free goods rather than questioning abnormalities. When visitors attempt securing devices through order forms, questions conveniently require private input they’d never normally provide random third-parties. Buried terms and conditions disclosures reveal victims actually consent steep recurring monthly charges exceeding $100 rather than reasonable one-time product voucher costs estimated around $10. With access to compromised confidential information, recurring credit charges activate alongside potentials for reselling data through unregulated dark web channels – each inflicting long-term damages through manipulation or identity theft. In summary, the fake celebrity MacBook giveaway ensnares social media users through emotional manipulation, urgency triggers, and concealed terms disclosing alternative money-making objectives unrelated to reasonably donation expensive electronics. The supposed Apple MacBook giveaway flows through platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok using manipulated content and psychological tactics deceiving users. Let’s review what signals commonly expose the questionable laptop promotion on each network. Exercise caution towards Facebook posts exhibiting these common deception indicators: For example, video spots insisting Jennifer Aniston helped secure Apple device gifts deserves reasonable skepticism before sharing or clicking. Analyze these questionable Instagram elements connected to free MacBook offers: Specifically, any Instagram account using an edited video of Tim Cook promising to giveaway MacBooks deserves reasonable vetting before proceeding. Apply extra scrutiny towards viral TikTok spots exhibiting these problems: If you spot oddly persuasive videos diverting outside links or caution throws aside chasing extraordinary free gifts, trust instinct and independently verify authenticity. Across all social channels, supposed celebrity and brand affiliated opportunities sacrificing little for substantial personal gain deserve deeper inspection before participation protecting oneself from preventable privacy damages. What seems too good often is until proven otherwise. Apply reasoned skepticism. In coordination with manipulated social media posts, the celebrity laptop scam also leverages a network of deceitful external websites helping lend credibility and justifying later requests for sensitive personal user information. Let’s review several consistent suspicious website patterns exposing the underlying scam despite convincing first impressions. Rather than building sites credibility from scratch, fraudulent MacBook operators impersonate respected news authorities by featuring established media logos like Fox News, CNN or People Magazine without permission. This tactic eases initial skepticism by assuming previous journalistic review for authenticity. Scammers interweave elaborate fake narratives around supply chain issues, discontinued products or settlement deals justifying extraordinary free device offers and reasonable requests for minor shipping reimbursements. But further scrutiny exposes contradictions challenging legitimacy. Sprinkled throughout the hype, suspicious accounts with very limited platform histories lend perceived credibility implying they successfully participated by securing heavily discounted or free MacBook laptops themselves already. But their manufactured advocacy aims lowering skepticism guards for improved scam conversion rates. While prominent graphics prompt urgent participation scarcely reviewing rules, buried terms disclosures reveal victims registering for expensive $100+ monthly subscription charges rather than reasonable one-time coupon shipment fees securing “free” devices. This demonstrate intention eliciting finances deceptively versus transparency. In summary, unbelievable holiday sweepstakes offers tied closely to respected brands require cautious inspection empowering individuals avoiding preventable privacy and financial damages. Look past emotional hooks and facades allowing objective logic reveal ulterior motives obscured from plain view by scammers. If you now face unauthorized recurring charges or services after attempting questionable giveaways, immediately take action: Contact banking providers regarding recent Apple scam discovery tied to unexpected account charges from organizations lacking proper authorization. Ask about fraud investigation and provisional reimbursements during disputes. Collect customer service information from deceptive monthly billing statements. Call providers clearly revoking any past payment authorizations now aware those were obtained under false pretenses rather than reasonable giveaway terms pitched initially. Record confirmation details should charges persist. Since compromised information retains lasting vulnerabilities, immediately update passwords and security answers while enabling robust multi-factor authentication across logins. Turn on credit monitoring alerting suspicious activities requiring quick intervention as well. File detailed reports about scam portals, product claims and damages incurred under false pretenses with both government and third-party consumer protection groups. Such filings support investigating repeat offenders warranting legal intervention assisting all negatively impacted victims. Several consistent red flags help reveal when a too-good-to-be-true viral MacBook deal likely intends facilitating financial theft rather than contest generosity: 1. Unauthorized Branding Use Without Attribution 2. Situational Urgency Tactics Encouraging Haste 3. Disproportionate Requested Fees 4. Comment Irregularities 5. Restricted External Website Disclosures By recognizing these patterns early, individuals avoid compromising into preventable damages chasing unbelievable free gifts down detour paths ending exploitation rather than sincerity. Apply skepticism before acting. Find answers below to the most commonly searched questions regarding supposed Apple sponsored MacBook holiday giveaways promotions currently circulating social media and questionable external websites. Despite advertisements featuring exciting inventory liquidation narratives and video footage seeming to show Apple leadership endorsing giveaways, the entire campaign constitutes an elaborate scam effort aiming to phish peoples’ credentials and finances rather than reasonably donate expensive technology free to random individuals. No reputable evidence supports Apple facilitating any such laptop contests recently. This scam often utilizes manipulated “deepfake” style video content falsely depicting Apple executives like Tim Cook endorsing the giveaway. Additionally, elaborate external portal pages mimic news authority branding alongside urgency cues directed encouraging desired actions outside reasoned thought.

Despite flashy incentives promising free high-end Apple laptops to social media followers attempting order processes, victims never receive devices.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts whenever possible. Be careful where you click. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These could potentially contain malware or phishing scams. Don\\'t use pirated software. Avoid using Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing programs, keygens, cracks, and other pirated software that can often compromise your data, privacy, or both. To avoid potential dangers on the internet, it\\'s important to follow these 10 basic safety rules.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'YouTube scam features fake Jennifer Aniston', 'content': ' The latest in celebrity-impersonating scams, a deepfake of Jennifer Aniston promoting a “MacBook giveaway,” is going viral over how convincing it is. The deepfake of actor Jennifer Aniston promoting a YouTube scam is circulating online, fuelling concern over how quickly such videos are becoming better in quality and more common. A post on Reddit has been upvoted thousands of times, with hundreds of comments discussing the latest technology-facilitated attempt to fool those gullible enough to believe it. While many agreed the video had plenty of tell-tale signs of being fake – from bizarre facial expressions to lip movements not entirely matching what was being said – others voiced apprehension at the increasing quality of such scams. “The scam itself isn’t good at all and still obvious (even if they paid the real Jennifer Aniston to say it, lol), but the technology behind it is getting so good so fast,” the original poster’s message read. “It says a lot that the video and audio aren’t the most suspicious thing, it’s the poor writing quality/grammar. Absolutely crazy,” it continued. Others noted that none of the red flags were making the scam less effective. “These exact scams have been around for 20+ years. We keep seeing them because they work. If they didn\\'t work, scammers would do something else,” one user said. “Most people can spot them a mile away, but the ones that can\\'t are the ones that get caught up in it. They\\'re obviously the targets,” they added. Commenters also noted that the video was good enough to circumvent a detection algorithm used by YouTube’s parent company, Google, and that the artificial intelligence technology behind it was now widely available to anyone. “The next decade is going to be interesting,” the top comment on the thread said. In the video, Jennifer Aniston\\'s likeness promotes an age-old “giveaway” scam. It tells viewers that “if you’re watching this video, you’re one of the 10,000 lucky people who will get a MacBook Pro for just $10.” The user is then urged to follow a link and claim their device in the \"world’s largest MacBook giveaway.” The likeness of Taylor Swift was also used earlier this month to promote a fake Le Creuset cookware giveaway on Facebook and TikTok, capitalizing on the fact that the singer is an actual fan of the luxury French brand. In October last year, a similar scam campaign featuring popular YouTuber MrBeast emerged online, while the likeness of actor Tom Hanks was used in a dental plan ad without his consent.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': ' Feb 17,2024', 'title': 'Beware: Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway Scam Exposed!', 'content': '                     Table of Contents: In today\\'s digital age, scams and fraudulent activities have become rampant, targeting unsuspecting individuals across various platforms. One such scam is the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, which promises the opportunity to obtain a MacBook Pro for just $2. However, this scheme preys on people\\'s desire to own expensive gadgets at an unbelievably low price. In this article, we will delve into the details of this scam, exposing its deceptive tactics and hidden subscription charges. The online world is filled with enticing offers and giveaways that claim to provide users with extravagant prizes, often at unbelievable prices. However, it is crucial to remain vigilant and cautious, especially when an offer seems too good to be true. The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a prime example of such a scam. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are commonly exploited by scammers to reach a large audience. Jennifer Aniston\\'s image and likeness are used without permission to promote the fraudulent MacBook Pro giveaway. These ads, often accompanied by fake photos and misleading claims, lure unsuspecting users into clicking the link to claim their prize. It is disheartening to see that Facebook and Instagram, despite claiming to take scams seriously, continue to accept money from scammers to run these deceptive ads. Their profit-driven approach prioritizes investors\\' satisfaction over the well-being and protection of their users from such scams. Upon clicking the ad, users are redirected to a fake website, such as Droidgiveaway.info or SLmacb0000K2PB.index.php. These websites aim to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, stating that only a limited number of MacBooks are available. However, these claims are far from the truth. The scammers employ various phishing tactics to extract personal information from users. They typically ask users to answer a few questions or provide their details under the guise of being a \"giveaway winner.\" It is important to note that these tactics are solely designed to deceive and manipulate users into divulging their information. As users progress through the process, they finally reach a point where hidden subscription charges come into play. The scammers demand a payment of $29.97 for a \"guaranteed placement in the contest to win.\" This sudden shift from a seemingly inexpensive offer to a significant payment catches users off guard. The lack of transparency regarding these charges is alarming. By burying this information deep within the terms and conditions, the scammers intentionally attempt to deceive users and maximize their own profits. The terms and conditions are often overlooked by users, especially when presented with an exciting opportunity like winning a MacBook Pro. However, it is crucial to read the fine print carefully. In the case of the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, the terms and conditions reveal the true nature of the scam. Buried within the text is a clause that states the user will be entering into a subscription and agreeing to pay monthly fees. The scammers intentionally hide this information to ensure users remain unaware of the recurring charges they will incur. One of the key elements of this scam is the hidden monthly fees associated with a \"subscribe and save\" membership. By signing up for the contest under false pretenses, users unknowingly commit to paying these recurring charges. This deceptive tactic allows scammers to continue profiting off unsuspecting victims. When participating in these scams, users are often required to provide personal information, including their name, email address, and even payment details. The lack of transparency and clear indication of how this data will be used raises serious privacy concerns. It is important to exercise caution when sharing personal information online, especially with unknown sources. Scammers can exploit this data for malicious purposes, such as identity theft or unauthorized financial transactions. To safeguard yourself from falling victim to scams like the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway, it is essential to adopt a cautious approach. Here are a few tips to help protect yourself: By staying informed and skeptical, you can avoid becoming a victim of scams and protect your personal and financial well-being. The Jennifer Aniston MacBook Pro Giveaway is a clear example of the dangers that lurk in the digital landscape. Scammers exploit people\\'s desire for exclusive deals and prizes, using deceptive tactics and hidden charges to profit at the expense of unsuspecting individuals. It is crucial to remain vigilant, question suspicious offers, and prioritize your online safety. Remember, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez giveaway videos are deepfake scams', 'content': \"        Videos have recently been shared widely across social media claiming to show various celebrities hosting giveaways.  Jennifer Aniston in one video appears to be giving away Apple MacBooks. Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez are among the celebrities who appear to be advertising Le Creuset cookware.  But those videos don’t actually show the celebrities themselves. They are deepfakes likely created with some form of artificial intelligence (AI) software. People online sharing these videos say these videos are a scam, and the AI used to create it is getting better. VERIFY is here to help prevent you from falling victim to these types of celebrity scams with tips to help you spot AI. There are several types of manipulated videos that can spread false information. Two of the most common are deepfakes and shallowfakes. A deepfake video is made using artificial intelligence technologies, like programs that can be used to replace or synthesize faces, speech or expressions of emotions. Shallowfakes are created using simple video editing software; scammers make basic edits to combine or alter existing videos. In the examples we found of celebrities appearing to be giving away items, those are deepfakes created with the intention of scamming people into providing personal or financial information. When we reverse image searched a screenshot from the Jennifer Aniston MacBook giveaway video, we found it was actually created using a video published by the Wall Street Journal. The original video is a clip from an interview Aniston did in August 2023 about her career – she was not giving away MacBooks. The Selena Gomez giveaway deepfake was created using an interview between Gomez and fashion magazine Vogue about her fashion looks over the years, not LeCruset cookware.  Everything in the real and fake videos match, except for the words being said. If you see a celebrity ad or endorsement and wonder if it was made using AI, here are some tips that can help you identify AI and avoid falling for the scam. Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter! 1. How to spot a deepfake Here are questions to ask yourself when determining whether a video is real or fake: The MIT Media Lab, a research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offers these tips to help detect deepfakes: 2. Conduct a reverse image search Celebrities are regularly caught on camera, interviewed or photographed, so deepfakes are typically created using a real video the celebrity appeared in. If you conduct a reverse image search of a keyframe or screenshot from the video, you’ll likely  find the original video that was used to create the deepfake.  To conduct a reverse image search through Google using your computer, follow these steps: Google also has guides on reverse image searching from your iPhone or Android device.  RevEye is a browser extension you can install that also allows you to conduct a reverse image search by right-clicking any image online. A website called TinEye also allows you to upload an image from your computer to find where it has appeared online.  3. Examine the link before you click If a link looks suspicious, you can hover your mouse over it to see where the hyperlink will actually take you, a guide on online safety from Stony Brook University says. For example, if the message comes from someone claiming to be from one company, but the link you’re hovering over goes to a different website, that’s suspicious.  Boston University’s IT department says to use common sense and ask yourself: “Does a website look strange to you? Is it asking for sensitive personal information? If it looks unsafe, don't take the risk.” “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Is the website offering you a product or service at an unheard of price? Or maybe they are promising you a huge return on investment? If the offer looks too good to be true, trust your instincts. Do some research to find reviews or warnings from other users,” Boston University’s website says.  If the suspicious site’s URL isn’t the same as the official website of the brand being endorsed, that’s a red flag. Avoid clicking on it, and if you do, don’t enter any personal information. Here are some tips to consider before you click on any link. The University of Denver Information Security Department says to take a look at the web address, or URL, itself for these common red flags:  VERIFY reached out to Meta for comment on these deepfake scams and did not hear back at the time of publication.

It’s a deepfake video created with AI to scam people off their credit card details.     Please enable JavaScript    At the order page for the Macbook, instead of the $2 shipping fee, you would be tricked into a subscription scam. The Terms & Conditions written in small prints says ”You’ll be charged a one time charge of $119 at checkout ” Instead of a free Macbook, victims of this scam would get charged $119 for a shady subscription plan, and wouldn’t receive any Macbook. SCAM GIVEAWAY! Table of Contents The scam uses a deep fake generated video of Jennifer Anitson. A close look at the video shows the audio and facial expression don’t match. This is quite common with deepfake videos. Pay attention to blinking and the lip movements. It doesn’t look natural On the comment section of the fake giveaway posts there are comments and reviews from people posing as winners. However, the profiles are fake and the reviews were scripted to make people believe the giveaway is real. When you go to pay for the $2 shipping fee, there are tiny letters in the checkout page which says you’re subscribing to a service and would get debited for some amount of money monthly. After paying for shipping, you wouldn’t receive the prize or get any tracking number, rather you will receive unauthorised charges on your credit card. Aside from subscribing you to a phoney service, this scam also steals your sensitive data like your credit card number and name when you pay for shipping. This information is then sold to the dark web and used to commit different kinds of fraudulent activities. The first thing you should do is contact your bank to inform them about the fraudulent subscription. Through the chargeback system, you can get your money back from the transaction if you file a dispute claim. Since you unknowingly subscribed for a service which you can’t trace, it’d be best if you ditch the credit card and get a new one. That way you wouldn’t get charged for the subscription again. The second step you should take is updating your passwords. This should be done if you’ve used the same password you used on other websites or applications. You should also go an extra step of enabling two-factor authentication. This would keep you protected from data breech. There’s a likelihood that your device has been infested by malware or spyware after visiting the site. Scanning your device with a malware removal tool will detect and remove any viruses, spyware, or other malicious programs. See best malware device tools here The first step you should take is finding out if the giveaway has been posted on the company’s social media accounts. If it hasn’t, the giveaway is likely a scam. Legit giveaways don’t ask for any kind of fee, whether shipping or handling fee. Scan the giveaway post. Do you notice bad grammar, missing words, or spelling mistakes? These are red flags for a scam. Any company can make a minor mistake when typing out a win notification. However, multiple or glaring errors are a bad sign. Are there reviews or posts about the giveaway online? It’s common for various news outlet to carry information about legit giveaways. By searching for reviews online you could also come across warning posts or complaints. The Jennifer Anitson Macbook giveaway 2023 is not real. It’s a scam orchestrated by fraudsters whose aim is to steal people’s personal and financial information. The videos used by this scam was generated with Artificial intelligence.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Apple TV+ to Hollywood A-Listers: “Come Get Your Free iPhone!”', 'content': '  BY LAURA BRADLEY Imagine for a moment, if you please, offering Oprah Winfrey a free iPhone. What would the billionaire who has famously showered her fans in diamond watches and Volkswagens say when asked, “Which style iPhone would you prefer?” Would she raise an eyebrow? Stifle a chuckle? Counter by offering you a free MacBook Pro? According to a new dispatch from the Hollywood Reporter, Apple has basically been doing just that, offering each showrunner and series regular—a club that includes A-listers Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Winfrey—a free Apple product. Per THR, Apple has “dispatched representatives to the sets of shows including Dickinson to take orders from talent on which style iPhone or iPad they’d prefer.” By signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Apple has clearly brought a lot of money for its entry into original programming, but thus far it hasn’t been enough to mask some behind-the-scenes shake-ups. Multiple series—including the Aniston- and Witherspoon-starring Morning Show and the Steven Spielberg anthology show, Amazing Stories—have seen showrunner swaps. Apple’s development executives, meanwhile, have been a fixture on some sets as the company tries to ensure its programming stays in line with the brand overall. (As THR notes, a recent BuzzFeed report alleges the company also told its showrunners to avoid offending China.) Some bumps are to be expected whenever a company first tries dipping its toe into the Hollywood pool—but Apple’s bid for eyeballs has proven particularly costly, raising the stakes for a company that, by its own TV+ strategist’s admission, “[doesn’t] know anything about making television.” For instance: THR reports that Morning Show costs $15 million to make per episode. Witherspoon and Aniston are each making $2 million per episode, with the show’s two seasons costing Apple $300 million total. The company’s per-month subscription rate, meanwhile, is a mere $5—one of the lowest of all the upcoming streaming platforms, perhaps because Apple TV+ will have no library content, instead focusing solely on originals. That means 60 million would have to sign up for a month of service for Morning Show to break even, though given Apple’s plan to offer a free year of the service to anyone who purchases a select Apple product, operating at a loss for a while is clearly not a huge concern for the company worth $1 trillion. As THR notes, Apple TV+ could, if successful, boost revenue for the company’s services division—meaning, basically, the non-hardware offerings including Apple Music, Apple News, and iCloud—which the company’s CEO, Tim Cook, said in 2016 that he aimed to double by 2020. That said, one expert seemed skeptical when speaking with THR: As the director of the USC Annenberg Center for the Digital Future, Jeffrey Cole, put it, “Apple has an innovation crisis. Entertainment is one of their attempts to do something innovative, but they’re just dabbling.” Would Apple Produce a Show like Game of Thrones? — Apple learns from one of Netflix’s biggest mistakes\\n— What the real-life inspiration for Hustlers thinks of J.

If you have been deceived by the Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam, it is crucial to promptly safeguard yourself and your finances. Follow these steps to mitigate the impact of the scam and protect your assets: Symptoms: The unwanted application can cause several adverse effects, such as displaying intrusive pop-up ads and slowing down internet browsing. The threat can manipulate the settings of an internet browser. This manipulation forces users to visit the hijacker’s website and conduct internet searches using their search engine. Distribution: Browser hijackers or adware such as Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam can spread through deceptive pop-up ads, free software installers that are bundled with malware, and fake Flash Player installers. Removal: To remove the threat, scan your system with powerful SpyHunter anti-malware software  The purpose of adware or browser hijacker is to generate revenue through targeted advertising. It collects user data, such as browsing habits and preferences, to deliver personalized ads. By bombarding users with ads, the unwanted program aims to increase the chances of users clicking on them, leading to potential revenue for its developers. While adware is primarily an annoyance and can compromise user privacy, it is often a means for companies to monetize free software and services without directly charging users. The primary objective of a browser hijacker is to promote certain websites, generate traffic, and potentially earn revenue through advertising or other means by exploiting the user’s browsing experience without their consent.  Devices can fall victim to browser hijackers or adware through the download of infected files, malevolent email attachments, or visits to compromised websites. These hijacking tools may be bundled within browser extensions or included as part of software packages. Additionally, browser based threats can stem from shareware, freeware, or spyware infections, further expanding their potential sources of origin. Potentially unwanted programs like Jennifer Aniston MacBook Giveaway Scam often find their way onto users’ devices unintentionally, as users can be deceived into unknowingly downloading them. This can occur when users agree to an extra download mentioned in the terms and conditions of software installation. Another tactic involves misleading users with a choice to decline the installation of the browser hijacker software, but the wording deliberately confuses them, resulting in the inadvertent download. Once installed, PUP initiates its malicious actions by manipulating the user’s browser activities through embedded malevolent code.  Browser hijacking refers to the unauthorized modification of web browser’s settings or behavior by malicious software or websites.  It can have various impacts on users and their browsing experience. Here are some common impacts of browser hijacking:  This undesirable application can cause instability in web browsers by modifying critical settings, introducing incompatible software, or consuming system resources. Users may experience frequent crashes, slow performance, or unresponsiveness while browsing. In more severe cases, browsing hijacking can lead to unauthorized access to online accounts. PUPs may attempt to steal login credentials, financial information, or other sensitive data, putting users at risk of identity theft or fraud. Furthermore, browser hijacking can be a part of a larger malware infection. In such cases, adware or hijacker may serve as a gateway for other malicious software, such as ransomware, keyloggers, or spyware, further compromising the user’s system and data. Also, browser-based threats with data collection abilities can cause severe problems. They can gather sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and personal details, leading to identity theft and fraud. The collected data may also be sold to third parties, compromising user privacy. Additionally, targeted advertising based on the collected information can result in a flood of intrusive and potentially malicious ads.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'How Apple Finally Convinced Jennifer Aniston to Return to TV', 'content': 'Toggle Dark Mode Two years ago, when Apple’s plans for what would eventually become Apple TV+ were still in their infancy, Apple’s new dynamic duo of top TV execs knew that they would need to get some high-profile content if the company’s streaming service was going to be a hit. One of their first moves after putting together Apple’s new worldwide video programming division was to boldly approach Hollywood’s Creative Arts Agency (CAA) to attempt to woo talent no less significant than Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The result was Apple’s very first original content deal, signed in November 2017 for a “morning drama series” that would later become the much-talked-about The Morning Show. While producing the new series hasn’t been without its obstacles, by the time the dust settled, Apple had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into ensuring its success — more than it cost HBO to produce the entire final season of Game of Thrones. While Apple’s very deep pockets undoubtedly played a part in signing many of its higher profile content deals, there’s also no underestimating the role the company’s culture and reputation has played as well. For example, Oprah, who is already one of the wealthiest producers in Hollywood, joined forces with Apple because she believes in Apple TV+ and the audience that it can reach. Now, in a new interview with Variety, Jennifer Aniston speaks for the first time about her partnership with Apple on The Morning Show, sharing similar feelings about Apple’s culture and the work that she will be doing with them. There was really something exciting about being the first at Apple. Apple is pretty awesome. They make cool stuff. Why wouldn’t they maybe make cool television? And they are all about quality, not quantity, so that was really appealing. And in spite of their comical secrecy, it’s been worth it. Who doesn’t want to be part of the Wild Wild West? Aniston goes on to note that “even though they didn’t have walls yet or telephones” she was still excited about working with Apple, and while she had some reservations, they were minor compared to the excitement of not only working with Apple, but being the first to do so, and Aniston was confident that her production team “knew what we were doing.” In fact, if anything, it’s remarkable that Apple has been able to attract Aniston back to the small screen after an illustrious film career. Aniston’s headlining appearance in The Morning Show will be the first time she’s been on TV since her legendary role as Rachel Green in Friends made her a household name 15 years ago. There haven’t been a shortage of offers, either, with Aniston saying she’s declined many over the years out of a desire to focus on films, plus the feeling that nothing could compare with the experience she had while working on Friends. The Morning Show, however, appears to have reinvigorated this desire in Aniston, not only in terms of working with Apple, but also for the sake of the material itself. While the show was originally envisioned as simply focusing on the “cutthroat world of morning TV,” Variety notes that it was “completely rewritten” for the “Me Too” movement after Matt Lauer was fired from Today in November 2017, less than a month after Aniston inked her deal with Apple. The show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s— hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch. However, although Mitch Kessler, the disgraced anchor who will be played by Steve Carell on The Morning Show, bears some resemblances to Lauer, Aniston insists that the the show is a work of fiction. In fact, Aniston adds that while studying old episodes of Today and Good Morning America to develop her character for The Morning Show, she even re-watched Today from the day before Lauer was fired, asking herself whether he knew it was coming. I went to the DVR that I had of “Today” before Matt Lauer was fired and then the day he was fired, because that was so fascinating to see. Mitch Kessler is not based on him at all. He’s just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he’s representing. Aniston notes that she was also encouraged to return to TV by the rise of streaming services, and the amount of quality content now being produced by all of them, along with the shift of Hollywood big screen films into the Marvel universe — she says she wasn’t “really that interested in living in a green screen,” and would much rather see the “era of Meg Ryan come back” when there were more “cozy” and dramatic films showing in theatres. At the same time, Aniston reveals that she has mixed feelings about streaming, saying that she’s both “shocked” and “excited” that this is where things are at, and has been even more surprised that companies like Apple, Netflix, and WarnerMedia are putting such huge amounts of money into it, specifically citing the $80 million that the latter recently paid for the streaming rights to Friends. While Aniston has only signed on for two seasons of The Morning Show so far, she also isn’t ruling out doing a third season, as long as “there’s stuff to talk about” and they’re not “dead tired from it.” The Morning Show has understandably been one of Apple’s most-hyped new shows, and it’s expected to debut right away when Apple TV+ launches on Nov. 1, although it’s likely that only the first couple of episodes will be available at launch, with viewers needing to follow a more traditional weekly release schedule to keep up with the show.

It was one of the first shows put in motion by veteran television executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, who joined Apple in 2017 At The Morning Show’s premiere, Erlicht talked about how he and Van Amburg heard the pitch for the series on their third day on the job at Apple. PROMOTED “We knew right away this was the one,” Erlicht said, according to a recording of the presentation obtained by Forbes. “It was everything we were hoping to do. … It was a show loaded with layers and subtext, it was about something real, and honestly, it didn’t hurt that it was exec-produced and stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.” Trouble was, they didn’t know how to order paper clips for the office, let alone a series. There were no employees, no business affairs staff, no negotiators and no budget. It would take three to four months to close the deal, Erlich said, with per-episode costs that approach that of HBO’s Game of Thrones, according to one source familiar with the financing. “The negotiation was not easy. In fact I’ll say nothing about this show has been what I would describe as easy,” Erlich said. “But the great ones never are. And that’s what The Morning Show is. A great one.” Forbes Daily: Get our best stories, exclusive reporting and essential analysis of the day’s news in your inbox every weekday.    The show represents Aniston’s return to television 15 years after saying goodbye to her Emmy Award-winning portrayal as Rachel Green on Friends. Whether she and co-stars Witherspoon and Steve Carell can attract viewers to the nascent service will be an early test of Apple’s decision to build its own original slate of TV shows. The Apple TV+ service will compete for attention with newcomers Disney+, WarnerMedia’s HBO Max and NBCUniversal’s Peacock. All are seeking to capitalize on the streaming phenomenon ignited by Netflix, which has amassed more than 60 million subscribers in the U.S. and even more internationally. Apple, like Amazon, is positioning its streaming service as a perquisite that supports its main business. The iPhone-maker is offering one year’s free access with the purchase of a new device (others can access it through the Apple TV app for $5 a month).   “It’s a gift to our users and, from a business point of view, we’re really proud of the content,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook during Wednesday’s investor call. “We’d like as many people as possible to view it. This allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. We think it’s a bold move.” Morgan Stanley projects that Apple TV+ could become a $9 billion business by 2025 if just one out of every ten Apple user subscribes to the streaming service. That would further propel Apple’s fast-growing services business, which reported a record $12.5 billion in revenue for the September quarter. Apple has been working toward this moment for the last two years, starting with the recruitment of Erlicht and Van Amburg, who as presidents of Sony Pictures Television had developed a roster of acclaimed shows including Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad, The Crown and The Shield. Apple’s first original series, Planet of the Apps, in which entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to celebrity investors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, will.i.am and Gary Vaynerchuk, took a critical drubbing as “both boring and self-indulgent.” Erlicht and Van Amburg set out in search of shows that would fit with the image Apple burnished for itself through brand-defining ad campaigns like 1997’s “Think Different” promotion, where it aligned itself with “the Crazy Ones” who changed the world—Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Amelia Earhart, Pablo Picasso.  “We believe deeply in the power of creativity,” Cook said at an event in March where the company announced Apple TV+. “Our products help people express their creativity and tell their stories, because great stories can change the world. Great stories can move us and inspire us. They can challenge our assumptions.” Apple courted world-class talent, including Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg and acclaimed talk show host and media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who would bring prestige to the service. But it was wary of themes that might offend Apple consumers, including gratuitous violence or unflattering depictions of religion, say Hollywood insiders familiar with these conversations. This fall, the tech giant scrapped a high-profile project, Bastards, in which Richard Gere was to star as one of two elderly Vietnam veterans who go on a shooting spree to avenge the death of a woman they both loved. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that Apple was worried about the show’s exploration of vigilante justice and instead urged a story line built around the vets’ enduring friendship.  Cook personally made the decision in 2016 to shut down Apple’s first scripted project, Vital Signs, a semi-autobiographical tale of its star, Dr. Dre, which contained scenes of cocaine use, a mansion orgy and gun brandishing, the Wall Street Journal reported.   But that was before Erlicht and Van Amburg took the helm and sought to build bridges in a wary Hollywood. They would have to overcome nervousness about a product that was shrouded in secrecy and grumbling over the tech giant’s tone-deaf decision in 2014 to force a free copy of the U2 album Songs of Innocence on everyone with an iTunes account, whether they wanted it or not. There have been occasional missteps.  Celebrities, studio executives and deal-makers traveled to Cupertino on a cool March morning to take part in Apple’s much anticipated launch of its subscription video service. But in a snub, major Hollywood figures who’d made the pilgrimage north—including directors Ron Moore and M. Night Shyamalan—never made it onstage.  Everyone in the room was left guessing about key details of the Apple TV+ service, including the launch date and pricing. Indeed, as Apple prepared to make its big move on Hollywood, the technology giant still clung to the rituals of a tightly controlled product launch. Even so, Apple was able to overcome these obstacles and attract big-name talent. The launch lineup of original series include For All Mankind, an alternate telling of the space race from Moore; Dickinson, a coming-of-age story featuring Hailee Steinfeld as the rebellious young poet Emily Dickinson; and See, set in the distant future, after a virus has ravaged the planet and left the survivors blind, starring Jason Momoa.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Apple Has Made Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon the Highest Paid TV Stars in Hollywood', 'content': 'Toggle Dark Mode Apple has never held back when it’s serious about breaking into a new industry. The iPod and iTunes revolutionized the music industry, the iPhone changed the mobile phone landscape forever, and the iPad has now defined what a tablet computer is supposed to be. So not surprisingly, once Apple decided it was time to get serious about movies and TV shows, it entered Hollywood with the same confidence, boldness, and aggressiveness that the company showed with the music industry back in 2001. When Apple launched iTunes almost two decades ago, it sought out and made groundbreaking deals with every major music label, and we’ve all seen what came out of that. Now with Apple TV+ on the cusp of launching to the world, The Hollywood Reporter has shared some other interesting details on Apple’s journey to Hollywood, and the kind of money that the trillion-dollar company is wiling to put on the table to ensure that it attracts the best talent it can in order to produce the best content it possibly can. They didn’t step in halfway. They were smart to hire people who have spent their careers at the center of the TV business, and they didn’t stutter start. The report also recaps some of the early obstacles we’d already heard about with The Morning Show, along with the revelation that Apple spent $300 million on two seasons of that particular series alone, with $40 million of that going to Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, who are making a negotiated $2 million each per episode simply for their starring roles — and that’s on top of what they’re also receiving as executive producers and owners of the show. This easily places Aniston and Witherspoon among the highest paid television stars in Hollywood, coming in just behind Charlie Sheen (Two and a Half Men), Ray Romano (Everybody Loves Raymond), and Kelsey Grammer (Frasier) — the only other members of the “$2 Million Club” (after adjustments for inflation are factored in). While The Morning Show also stars Steve Carrell, it appears that he’s not considered one of the main cast, and (spoiler alert!) he’s actually only got a one-year deal for the show, despite the fact that Apple has ordered two seasons of it. In fact, Apple is already reportedly searching for a new high-profile male lead to replace him in the second season. With Apple taking Hollywood by storm — making bold new deals with A-list creators such as Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg and setting up its own in-house studio — there’s every reason to expect Apple TV+ to do for television and movies what iTunes did for music. For one thing, Apple is taking the rather unique approach of going at it solely with its own staple of brand new content, rather than having a large library of licensed content to fall back on. This gives Apple the kind of independence it likes to have, and it’s a smart move in an era when everybody from Disney to Warner and NBC are setting up their own competing services and clawing back on their licensing deals anyway. Apple will be beholden to no one when it comes to the success or failure of Apple TV+. The two-way relationship they have with the consumer and the vast number of consumers they have, that’s going to be game-changing, Secondly, Apple already has a huge and loyal customer base that are already plugged into its ecosystem. This means that when Apple TV+ launches next month, most people will be able to subscribe to it with the push of a button and the scan of a face. While there have been some conflicting reports about how much Apple is actually involved in the production of each show, the Reporter indicates that there’s still a certain amount of direct involvement just to “ensure that each show fits the Apple brand.” Despite rumours that Apple was going to avoid risqué content and stay “family friendly,” this seems to be more about ensuring that whatever a show is doing fits the story that Apple wants to tell. For example, The Morning Show doesn’t shy away from using adult language and situations, but Apple clearly feels that explicit and edgy content shouldn’t simply be there for “shock value” or for its own sake unless it contributes to the story. By contrast, Apple recently scrapped the gritty and violent drama Bastards that would have told the story of two aging and disillusioned Vietnam vets who go on a youth-focused killing spree. However, by all reports the show wasn’t scrapped solely because of the violent content, but rather due to its focus on a “tone of vigilante justice” rather than the “larger metaphor of friendship” between the two stars. A similar fate appears to have delayed Steven Spielberg’s Amazing Stories anthology, which the original showrunners had envisioned as an “edgy, high-concept” show, but Apple declared that vision as being too dark and replaced the original lead team with Once Upon a Time duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Despite a report earlier this week that said that the series would also be coming in November, it appears to have been delayed.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Work Wives: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon Unpack ‘Morning Show’ Twists, Space Travel and Messy Romances', 'content': ' Photographs by Dan Doperalski “We knew this season was different.” That’s how “The Morning Show” star and executive producer Reese Witherspoon begins Variety’s conversation about the third season of the Apple TV+ series. Co-star (and fellow executive producer) Jennifer Aniston adds, “It had a different shape to it.” In their first interview after the SAG-AFTRA strike — and the day of the Critics’ Choice nominations — Witherspoon and Aniston dissect Season 3’s wild twists and turns, which include a trip to space with Jon Hamm’s billionaire character Paul Marks, as well as a Jan. 6 insurrection storyline.  The two have known each other for more than 20 years, and as Aniston puts it: “We’re partners. We’re friends. We’re girlfriends, and we share all sorts of heartbreaks in life and love and everything.” To that end, when she begins crying while speaking about the death of her “Friends” co-star Matthew Perry, Witherspoon immediately grabs Aniston’s hand, and doesn’t let go for the rest of the conversation.  At the beginning of each season, do you know everything that’s to come for your characters? Specifically, Reese, did you know the insurrection plot that would be the linchpin of your character Bradley’s arc? Reese Witherspoon: I knew I had this secret that was going to get revealed by the end. When Charlotte Stoudt came in — this is her first season at “The Morning Show” — she pitched out the whole thing: the hack; Paul Marks coming in to take over; Alex [played by Aniston] wanting a position of power on the board; my character hiding this Jan. 6 secret.\\nJennifer Aniston: It’s such a collaboration, and we are able to say if we felt like it wasn’t going in a great direction. That’s the fun of what we do together, having that open line of communication. How did you react when you heard that the premiere would include a trip to space? Aniston: Wow. Going into space, huh? Personally, I was like, “I would never do that! You’ve got to be out of your freaking mind!”\\nWitherspoon: I would never do that either! It appeared to fans that you were in far fewer scenes together this season. Reading your faces, is that not how it seemed to you? Witherspoon: We do have two different storylines, so if we did everything together it’d be like, we’d never sleep. It’d be like I work the day shift, and you work the night shift. I do hear that people’s favorite scenes are when we’re together.\\nAniston: I know, it’s just hard to put it into each other’s storylines because they’re separate. Unless I was popping up in your and Julianna [Margulies]’s bed, like, “Hi, can I get you some coffee?”  You’ve worked together a long time. How would you describe your working and personal relationship? Aniston: We’ve been in each other’s lives for 20-something years. It’s just in our DNA that we are collaborators. We’re partners. We’re friends. We’re girlfriends, we share all sorts of heartbreaks in life and love and everything.\\nWitherspoon: There’s a comfort to that. It’s just mutual respect and years of experience. And I think we’re both incredulous that we’re both still kicking around! That we’re still working at this level is such a privilege. It’s an honor to get to contribute to something that’s really speaking about the world we live in nowadays.\\nAniston: That’s what we wanted to do: Make a show that said something and to show the conversations that happen behind closed doors. Bradley’s life ended in shambles — Laura has broken up with her, she’s turned herself in to the FBI for concealing evidence that her brother was a Jan. 6 insurrectionist. Witherspoon: She’s made a mess of her life! Everyone keeps asking me, “Does she go to jail?” We don’t know anything! There were nearly two full years between Seasons 2 and 3. Will there be a big time jump in Season 4? Witherspoon: I think so, just because it takes us so long. They write for so long, and have brand new storylines that are happening. I think we’re a little behind in time, too.\\nAniston: And our show tends to mirror what is actually happening in the world.\\nWitherspoon: Yeah, so as things come up while they’re writing, they’ll put them into the story. Is there a discussion of adding the Israel-Hamas war next season? Witherspoon: It has not come up. OK. Given that Bradley is likely going to prison, could she be on air again? Witherspoon: From prison?  Well, I was thinking after! Witherspoon: It’s far-fetched, but in this day and age, honestly, nothing surprises me anymore — except murder. Let’s talk about Alex and Paul. They had a passionate and, dare I say, sweet romance until she found out that he was a snake. Aniston: But was he? Or was that just his nature? I don’t think he felt that it was intentional. He just is who he is. But that was fun. I’ve known the Hammanator for a long, long time.\\nWitherspoon: How did y’all meet?\\nAniston: Paul Rudd! 12 years ago?\\nWitherspoon: Paul Rudd is his agent. I’m not kidding! I did a movie with Paul Rudd in 1996, and that’s when I met Jon Hamm. Alex and Paul’s love scene was more explicit than we’re used to seeing on the show. How did you guys prepare for that with director Mimi Leder? Witherspoon: I didn’t think it was explicit.\\nAniston: Having Mimi there, you’re protected. I never felt uncomfortable. Jon was such a gentleman, always — I mean every move, every cut, “You OK?” It was also very choreographed. That’s the beauty of Mimi and our gorgeous editor, the music and lighting. So, you don’t prepare. They asked us if we wanted an intimacy coordinator. I’m from the olden days, so I was like, “What does that mean?” They said, “Where someone asks you if you’re OK,” and I’m like, “Please, this is awkward enough!” We’re seasoned — we can figure this one out. And we had Mimi there.  Do you feel like Alex has a bad picker when it comes to men? This is the second time she’s chosen someone who’s publicly viewed as dangerous. Witherspoon: Who was the first?\\nAniston: Mitch.\\nWitherspoon: Oh, you weren’t a couple.\\nAniston: No, we weren’t a couple, but I loved him. Maybe we’ll find out why she has such a bad picker. It’s hard to be a really successful woman and make that part of your life — it’s sort of the last thing on your to-do list. You’re busy doing so many other things in the world, which is why I think I failed so terribly at marriage —\\nWitherspoon: In the show.\\nAniston: In the show, oh yeah!\\nWitherspoon: Just wanted to be clear. I don’t like saying women have bad pickers. Because that sort of feels like a judgment. Maybe Alex is brave enough to break her own heart.\\nAniston: Or maybe these are lessons she’s in need of. Because, everything I’ve gone through in my life, there’s not one thing I would do over, at all. It’s all our journey. Chip made quite a splash on air after being fired from “TMS.” Will Mark Duplass be back?  Aniston: We have no idea what could happen in our world.\\nWitherspoon: He could be in prison, too!\\nAniston: He could produce you from the cell. With everything going on in the world, what topics would you guys like to dive into? Witherspoon: I think it would be great to do something with AI and the veracity of news when things can be so easily manufactured. It’s really a strange time for journalism, and it just continues to evolve.\\nAniston: It’s unsettling to know that so much is manufactured and can be so easily manufactured and that so many people just believe it at face value. There was so much respect for journalism and now, it’s so divided — you listen to one news channel and it’s this story and another news channel and it’s this story. It’s heartbreaking, that division. I hope it’s just an ebb and flow, and that the goodness, the quality and the respect will hopefully come back. It’s a really scary time to be a journalist. Some people view the show as “camp.” What do you both think?  Witherspoon: Like “Dynasty” campy? I don’t have a good perspective about that. I think we’re the wrong people to ask! I love “Dynasty.” I love powerful women in great outfits having a verbal argument.\\nAniston: Give me some good “Below Deck: Down Under.” That’s all I can digest sometimes! What do you want people to get out of “The Morning Show”? Witherspoon: It’s creating adult conversations about issues that we’re dealing with every day in real time in our workplace environments and in our personal lives, so it helps us process. It mirrors a lot of what’s going on in the world, and life is complicated.\\nAniston: And there’s something about allowing people to sit and digest [weekly], because everything is so fast. People’s attention spans are just so limited. To have a moment to sit and digest and think about it and talk about it, maybe watch it again to try to understand it. Then to go back to when we used to communicate with one another and connect with one another, which is something that I feel that we have drastically lost with these phones and the amount of distractions. God bless the ’90s.\\nWitherspoon: She always says that.\\nAniston: We just had so much fun!  The show began with UBA rebuilding post-Mitch scandal. With UBA and MBN merging in Season 4, could this be a set up for the show’s final season? Witherspoon: Or does it create an entirely new world of characters? A new eco-system? We’ve always thought this world is so rich that you can find new characters, stories and new TV personalities, people who have emerged in the zeitgeist. How did you stay creative during the strike? Witherspoon: I found a chocolatier, and had them teach me and some of my friends how to make chocolates.\\nAniston: Actual chocolate bars?\\nWitherspoon: No, bonbons.\\nAniston: Like Lucy and Ethel?\\nWitherspoon: Yes, it’s so fun. We’ve got to do it! It’s so easy, too.\\nAniston: Can we please have a night where we do that? I made soap and tree ornaments. I went to Ojai, turned off the news, and with my three best friends since I was 15 and 20, just got creative.\\nWitherspoon: This is one of my favorite things about Jen — she has friends from high school on. It’s a testament to what a good friend you are.\\nAniston: We kind of raised each other. We all came from little tumultuous, broken families. It was the ’70s, ’80s, it was sort of a different time. People weren’t going, “How are you feeling? How does it make you feel?” No one’s ever asked me, “How does something make you feel?” All my friends’ kids are in therapy! Everybody’s fabulous. Your two kids — look at them!\\nWitherspoon: I have three.\\nAniston: Three! That’s what I meant.\\nWitherspoon: It’s hard to keep track. By the way, I forget sometimes. \\nAniston: You still look like a little tiny girl to me, like my little sister. Like I always said, baby with a baby.\\nWitherspoon: I was a baby with a baby when I was on the set of “Friends.” I was like, “I’m nursing! Want to see my baby?”  Speaking of “Friends,” Jennifer, you recently lost a member of the “Friends” family. How do you want the world to remember Matthew Perry? Aniston: As he said he’d love to be remembered. He was happy. He was healthy. He had quit smoking. He was getting in shape. He was happy — that’s all I know. I was literally texting with him that morning, funny Matty. He was not in pain. He wasn’t struggling. He was happy.\\nWitherspoon: It’s important people know that.\\nAniston: It is. I want people to know he was really healthy, and getting healthy. He was on a pursuit. He worked so hard. He really was dealt a tough one. I miss him dearly. We all do. Boy, he made us laugh really hard. So many people — from those who knew him to journalists — penned tributes to him. It must have been so incredible to see the outpouring of love. Aniston: It’s so beautiful. I hope he can know that he was loved in a way he never thought he was.\\nWitherspoon: You all were so close. It’s incredible what was born of those friendships, and how you guys have always taken care of each other for years and years. It’s really beautiful and set standards for our business, as well, with the way you respected each other. I feel lucky that I got to be on that show and I walked in like Alice in Wonderland, watching the most popular cast do this whole thing. I remember going home and going, oh, they’re in another league. They’re on another planet on comedy levels that I’ve never seen my entire life, pivoting on a dime and working on each other’s energy and it was extraordinary.\\nAniston: I also have to say I think Matthew Perry’s dialect, his way of speaking, created a whole different world. We went with his lead, in a way. It just added something to our joy.   This interview has been edited and condensed.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston', 'content': ' Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress. She rose to international fame for her role as Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends from 1994 to 2004, which earned her Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards. Since her career progressed in the 1990s, Aniston has become one of the world\\'s highest-paid actresses.[1] The daughter of actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1988 film Mac and Me. Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. She has since starred in a string of successful comedy films such as Office Space (1999), Bruce Almighty (2003), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), We\\'re the Millers (2013), Dumplin\\' (2018), and Murder Mystery (2019). Aniston also starred in the acclaimed independent films The Good Girl (2002), Friends with Money (2006), and Cake (2014). She returned to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, for which she received a Screen Actors Guild Award. Aniston has been included in numerous magazines\\' lists of the world\\'s most beautiful women. Her net worth is estimated as $300 million, and her box office gross is over $1.6 billion worldwide.[2] She is the recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and is the co-founder of the production company Echo Films, established in 2008. Aniston was born on February 11, 1969, in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles[3][4] to Greek-born actor John Aniston and actress Nancy Dow.[3] One of her maternal great-grandfathers, Louis Grieco, was from Italy.[5] Her mother\\'s other ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, and a small amount of Greek. Her father\\'s ancestry is from the Greek island of Crete. Aniston has two half-brothers: John Melick, her older maternal half-brother; and Alex Aniston, her younger paternal half-brother.[3] Her godfather was actor Telly Savalas, one of her father\\'s best friends.[3][6] Her family moved to New York City when she was a child.[3] Despite her father\\'s television career, she was discouraged from watching television, though she found ways around the prohibition. When she was six, she began attending a Waldorf school.[7] Her parents divorced when she was nine.[8] Having discovered acting at age 11 at the Waldorf school,[8] Aniston enrolled in Manhattan\\'s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school\\'s drama society,[9] and where Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher.[10] She performed in The Sign in Sidney Brustein\\'s Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov.[11] Aniston first worked in off-Broadway productions such as For Dear Life and Dancing on Checker\\'s Grave,[3] and supported herself with part-time jobs including work as a telemarketer, waitress and bike messenger.[3] In 1988, she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year, she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem,[12] and moved back to Los Angeles.[13] She obtained her first regular television role on Molloy in 1990 and appeared in Ferris Bueller, a television adaptation of the 1986 film Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off; both series were quickly canceled. She starred as a teenager going to summer camp in the made-for-television film Camp Cucamonga (1990), and as a spoiled daughter followed by a vengeful leprechaun in the horror film Leprechaun (1993).[14] A 2014 retrospective from Entertainment Weekly identified Leprechaun as her worst role,[15] and Aniston herself has expressed embarrassment over it.[16] Aniston also appeared in the two failed television comedy series The Edge and Muddling Through,[17] and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman\\'s Head and Burke\\'s Law.[18][19] Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. As the head of NBC entertainment, he encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her in Friends,[20][17] a sitcom set to debut on NBC\\'s 1994–1995 fall lineup. The producer wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller,[21] but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable, and Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down in favor of Friends.[22] She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004, when Aniston took a 15-year hiatus from television save for occasional guest roles. The program was a massive hit and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition. Her character was especially popular.[23][24] She received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), and won for Lead Actress.[25] She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck during the final season of Friends.[26] Her character\\'s relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer, was widely popular among audiences; they were frequently voted television\\'s favorite couple in polls and magazines.[27] After a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She\\'s the One.[28] Her first starring film vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), where she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. It received mixed reviews and was only a moderate commercial success;[29] but Aniston\\'s performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence.[30] In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection,[31] and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space.[32] Aniston appeared in the dramedy Rock Star (2001) opposite Mark Wahlberg and Dominic West. She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $14 million in North America.[33] Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough: After languishing in a series of overlooked movies that ranged from the entertaining Office Space to the disposable Picture Perfect, Jennifer Aniston has at last decisively broken with her Friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil. It will no longer be possible to consider her in the same way.[34] Aniston\\'s biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), where she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week.[35] With a worldwide box office gross of $484 million,[36][37] it was the fifth-highest-grossing feature film of the year.[38] Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newlywed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004) opposite Ben Stiller,[39] which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $27.7 million in its opening weekend;[40] it eventually made $172 million worldwide.[41] In 2005, Aniston appeared as an alluring woman having an affair with an advertising executive in the thriller Derailed, and as an obituary and wedding announcement writer in the romantic comedy Rumor Has It.[42][43] Both films were moderate box office hits.[44][45] Aniston took on the role of a single, cash-strapped woman working as a maid in the independent drama Friends with Money (2006), which received a limited release.[46] Her next film was the romantic comedy The Break-Up (2006), alongside Vince Vaughn, in which she starred as one half of a couple having a complicated split when both refuse to move out of the pair\\'s recently purchased home. It received mixed reviews but grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend and $204 million worldwide.[47] The A.V. Club\\'s Keith Phipps gave the film a negative review, stating, \"It\\'s like watching the \\'we were on a break\\' episode of Friends stretched to feature length, and without the blessed relief of commercial breaks or the promise of Seinfeld around the corner.\"[48] CinemaBlend gave the film a positive review stating, \"In an era of formulaic romantic movies that bear no resemblance to reality, The Break-Up offers a refreshing flipside.\"[49] In 2006, Aniston directed the short film Room 10, set in a hospital emergency room and starring Robin Wright and Kris Kristofferson, as part of Glamour\\'s Reel Moments film series.[50] She noted that she was inspired to direct by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also directed a short film that year.[51] In 2007, Aniston guest-starred in an episode of Dirt—playing the rival of Courteney Cox\\'s character[52]—and in an episode of 30 Rock, playing a woman who stalks Jack Donaghy.[53] For the latter she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.[54] The 2008 comedy drama Marley & Me, starring Aniston and Owen Wilson as the owners of the titular dog, set a record for the largest Christmas Day box office sales ever with $14.75 million. It earned a total of $51.7 million over the four-day weekend and placed number one at the box office, a position it maintained for two weeks.[55] The total worldwide gross was $242.7 million.[56] Her next film in wide release, the romantic comedy He\\'s Just Not That Into You (2009), in which she starred opposite Ben Affleck, grossed $178.8 million globally[57] and ranked number one at the United States box office for its opening weekend.[58] While it received mixed reviews, Aniston, along with Affleck, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jennifer Connelly, were praised by critics as standouts in the film.[59][60] Aniston appeared as the former wife of a bounty hunter (Gerard Butler) in the romantic comedy action film The Bounty Hunter (2010). The film was panned by critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that \"the mishmash ends up as a thoroughly unfunny adult cartoon.\"[61] Nevertheless, it was a box office success, garnering over $130 million worldwide.[62] A lukewarm box office reception greeted her next film, the romantic comedy The Switch (2010), in which she starred with Jason Bateman as a 30-something single woman who decides to have a child using a sperm bank. The film\\'s opening weekend drew what The Hollywood Reporter dubbed \"a dispiriting $8.4 million\".[63] The film received generally mixed reviews, with review site Metacritic showing 13 out of 30 critics delivering a positive verdict.[64] In 2010, Aniston was also a guest star on the season two premiere of ABC\\'s sitcom Cougar Town, playing a psychiatrist.[65] Her announcement that she would appear on Cougar Town garnered excitement and was dubbed her return to television. The A.V. Club wrote, \"[her role] is a funny bit, and it highlights just how much Jennifer Aniston is built to be a TV star.\"[66][67][68] In 2011, she starred opposite Adam Sandler as an office manager posing as the wife of a plastic surgeon in the romantic comedy Just Go with It,[69][70][71] and played a sexually aggressive dentist in Horrible Bosses.[72] Just Go with It and Horrible Bosses both made over $100 million in North America and $200 million worldwide.[73][74] Aniston appeared in the comedy Wanderlust (2012) with Paul Rudd,[75] with whom she acted in The Object of My Affection and also Friends, as a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them.[76] The script for Wanderlust, bought by Universal Pictures,[77] was produced by Judd Apatow.[78][79] Wanderlust received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.[80] Aniston starred as a struggling stripper who agrees to pose as a wife for a drug deal, with Jason Sudeikis, in We\\'re the Millers (2013). The film received mixed reviews from critics,[81] but was a financial success, grossing $269 million against a budget of $37 million.[82] Aniston played the role of a stoic socialite who becomes the target of an ill-planned kidnapping plot in Life of Crime (2014), a film adaptation of Elmore Leonard\\'s 1978 novel The Switch.[83] The film was released in limited theaters, to positive reviews.[84] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian described her performance as \"endearingly comic\"[85] and Eric Kohn of IndieWire wrote that \"Aniston tops any of her recent performances with a spirited turn that harkens back to her neurotic days on Friends.\"[86] She also reprised her role for Horrible Bosses 2 (2014).[87] In Cake (2014), Aniston starred as an astringent woman named Claire Simmons who struggles with chronic pain.[88] The film received mixed reviews; nonetheless, Aniston\\'s performance was acclaimed, dubbed by some critics as \"Oscar-worthy\".[89][90][91][92] The Toronto International Film Festival called her performance \"heartbreakingly good\",[93] Gregory Ellwood of HitFix stated, \"It\\'s really on most people\\'s radar for being a rare dramatic turn for Jennifer Aniston, and she doesn\\'t disappoint.\" He further stated, \"Aniston makes you believe in Claire\\'s pain. She makes you believe this character is at her lowest point and only she can pull herself out of it. ... It\\'s a complete performance from beginning to end and she deserves the appropriate accolades for it.\"[94] For her performance, Aniston was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama, SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role, and Critics\\' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.[95][96] She was also nominated multiple nominations for its latter seasons. In 2015, Aniston starred as a reluctant therapist in the screwball comedy She\\'s Funny That Way,[97] which received mixed reviews and found a limited release in theaters, but her performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of Grantland called her \"one of the great screen comedians. ... Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie needs them. ... This isn\\'t just Aniston having the best stuff. It\\'s her having the most fun with her talent. She\\'s funny in every way.\"[98] Aniston starred as the recently divorced mother of two children in the romantic comedy Mother\\'s Day (2016), directed by Garry Marshall, and opposite Julia Roberts and Kate Hudson.[99] The film was panned by critics and a moderate commercial success.[100] In 2016, she voiced a workaholic and overprotective mother in the animated film Storks, alongside Andy Samberg and Kelsey Grammer,[101] which was released to mostly positive reviews; it grossed over $183.4 million against a $70 million budget.[102][103] Her last 2016 film role was that of a frigidly cold head honcho of a company in the comedy Office Christmas Party, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon and opposite Jason Bateman and Kate McKinnon.[104] It grossed $114.5 million worldwide.[105] In The Yellow Birds, a war drama directed by Alexandre Moors, Aniston portrays the mother of a deceased soldier, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, Tye Sheridan, Jack Huston, and Toni Collette.[106] While she said she does not \"normally gravitate toward being in war films\", she made an exception because the film was \"written so beautifully and in such a way [she] had never experienced\".[107] The film, first presented at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, received a VOD release in June 2018.[108] The Los Angeles Times wrote in its review: \"Toni Collette and Jennifer Aniston as the soldiers\\' quite different but equally concerned mothers, deliver uniformly naturalistic performances\".[109] In December 2018, Netflix released the musical comedy Dumplin\\', with Aniston as executive producer and star—marking her first project for a streaming service.[110] That year, she began work on another Netflix project, Murder Mystery, a comedy that reunited her with Adam Sandler, which premiered on June 14, 2019.[111] The two of them reunited for the sequel Murder Mystery 2, which premiered on March 31, 2023.[112] Aniston made her return to television on November 1, 2019, producing and starring alongside Reese Witherspoon in the Apple TV+ drama The Morning Show. It was her first main television role since the conclusion of Friends in 2004.[113] For its first season, Aniston won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series,[114] and received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and two Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Best Television Series – Drama as a producer.[115][116] The series\\' latter seasons earned her multiple additional nominations at Critics\\' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards.[117][118][119] She reunited with her Friends cast mates for an HBO Max unscripted television special titled Friends: The Reunion in May 2021.[120] The special earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Pre-Recorded) for her producing credit.[121] Aniston is one of the world\\'s highest-paid actresses as of 2018.[122] She has been on the Forbes Top Earning Actresses list for 15 years, every year since 2001—and since then also on its Celebrity 100 list (based on \"earnings and fame\"), topping it in 2003.[123][124] According to Forbes, in October 2007, Aniston was the best-selling celebrity face of the entertainment industry.[125] The magazine estimated her net worth at $110 million in 2007,[126] and $200 million in 2017.[127] It listed her earnings as $19.5 million in 2018.[128] Aniston has been included in various magazine lists of the world\\'s most beautiful women.[129][130][131] In 2005, she became the first GQ Woman of the Year. She has frequently appeared on People magazine\\'s annual list of Most Beautiful Women, topping the ranking in 2004 and 2016.[132] She also topped the magazine\\'s Best Dressed List in 2006. She has been a regular on FHM\\'s 100 Sexiest Women in the World list since 1996, most recently ranking at number 79 in 2012.[133] A survey of their patients by two Hollywood plastic surgeons, reported in 2011 by The Daily Telegraph, identified her (alongside Gisele Bündchen and Penélope Cruz) as having one of the most sought-after body shapes.[134] In the same year, readers of Men\\'s Health voted her as the Sexiest Woman of All Time.[135] Men\\'s Health also included her on its 100 Hottest Sex Symbols of All Time list, explaining that \"Her down-to-earth persona makes her seem attainable, and anyone who\\'s seen her in Office Space has to admit she makes even pieces of flair look good. She rarely plays the airhead, and she seldom overplays a role: she\\'s funny in a quiet, refreshingly human way. And her all-too-human love life off screen inspires sympathy that not even a string of bland romantic comedies can diminish. Other sex symbols drift toward one-dimensionality, becoming flat icons in the process, but throughout her career Aniston has remained sexy, funny, and unmistakably real.\"[136] Although Aniston disliked the hairstyle she wore during her first two years on Friends, \"The Rachel\" became very popular.[137][138] She received a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 22, 2012,[139] located at 6270 Hollywood Boulevard.[140] She was ranked third on Forbes\\' list of the 100 Most Powerful Actresses in Hollywood in 2013.[141] In July 2016, amidst media speculation over whether she was pregnant, Aniston penned an essay for The Huffington Post condemning the \"objectification and scrutiny we put women through\". She asserted: \"We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. [...] We don\\'t need to be married or mothers to be complete. We get to determine our own \\'happily ever after\\' for ourselves.\"[142] The piece was supported by many celebrities and widely covered in the media.[143] After years of aversion to social media, Aniston joined Instagram on October 15, 2019, causing the app to \"break\" (for hours the \"follow\" button became inoperable due to an overload of web traffic to her account) with the first picture of the planned Friends cast reunion for HBO Max (whose release was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Within five hours and sixteen minutes, she broke the Guinness World Record for fastest time to reach one million followers on the platform.[144] The record was broken in September 2020, by Sir David Attenborough, who achieved the same feat in 44 minutes.[145] Aniston practices Hatha yoga and Budokan karate.[146][147][148] In 2014, she spoke of her Transcendental Meditation practice.[149] The following year, she revealed she has dyslexia, which had affected her education and self-esteem, and that after being diagnosed in her twenties, her outlook toward life changed. She stated, \"I thought I wasn\\'t smart. I just couldn\\'t retain anything. Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained.\"[150] Aniston donated to Barack Obama\\'s 2008 presidential campaign and took part in a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign.[151][152][153] She endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.[154] Aniston does not have any children. In July 2016, she wrote an op-ed piece for the HuffPost titled \"For the Record\", where she criticized the media for the focus on her body and speculation over potential pregnancies.[155] She wrote, \"The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.\" In November 2022, she appeared on the cover of Allure for their final print issue.[156] In the accompanying interview, Aniston said she had undergone IVF to try and have children when she was in her thirties and forties, but the attempts did not result in any pregnancies.[157] She said, \"All the years and years and years of speculation... It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it.\"[156] In 2023, she disclosed that Adam Sandler\\'s family sends her flowers every year on Mother\\'s Day.[158] Aniston met Brad Pitt in 1998, and their relationship was highly publicized.[159][160] She married Pitt, after two years of dating, on July 29, 2000, in a lavish Malibu wedding. For a few years, their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success.[3] On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation,[161] and finalized their divorce on October 2.[162] During their divorce proceedings, news media speculated that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, with whom he began a relationship soon after the split.[163] In the months following, the public\\'s reaction towards the divorce was reported in the press, and \"Team Aniston\" and \"Team Jolie\" T-shirts appeared throughout the country.[163] Aniston commented on the divorce in a January 2015 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stating, \"Nobody did anything wrong... It was just like, sometimes things [happen].\"[150] In 2005, amid reports that their divorce was due to Aniston\\'s refusal to have children with Pitt, Aniston said, \"I\\'ve never in my life said I didn\\'t want to have children. I did and I do and I will! ... I would never give up that experience for a career.\" Aniston said the divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, Nancy, from whom she had been estranged for nearly a decade. Nancy had talked about her daughter on a television show and written From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir (1999).[164][165] Aniston said she had been devastated by the death of her longtime therapist, whom she credited for helping make her separation from Pitt easier.[51] She said she did not regret her relationship with Pitt, describing it as \"very intense\" and \"a beautiful, complicated relationship\".[166] Aniston began a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011. The following January, they purchased a home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles for roughly $22 million.[167] They became engaged on August 10, 2012[168] and were married on August 5, 2015, at their estate.[169] They separated at the end of 2017.[170] Aniston has appeared in commercials and music videos throughout her career. After starting on Friends, Aniston and her co-star Matthew Perry shot a 60-minute instructional video for the release of Microsoft\\'s Windows 95 operating system.[171] The next year she appeared in commercials for L\\'Oréal hair products.[172] Under a contract with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.,[173] Aniston worked for over a year on her first perfume, which was released in July 2010.[174][175] Original plans called for the perfume to be named \"Lolavie by Jennifer Aniston\", but to avoid confusion with a similarly named perfume, the name was changed to simply \"Jennifer Aniston\".[176] In 2014, she launched her second perfume, named J,[177][178] followed by Near Dusk (2015),[173] Beachscape (2016),[179] Luxe & Chapter One (both in 2017), Chapter Two (2018), Silver & Solstice Bloom (both in 2020).[180][181] In 2021, Aniston launched the LolaVie haircare company.[182] Since 2007, she has worked in a publicity campaign for the drink SmartWater; on March 7, 2011, she released a YouTube video for SmartWater, Jennifer Aniston Goes Viral, which tripled online interest in the product within 24 hours of its release.[183] In 2012, Aniston co-founded hair care brand Living Proof and also became its spokeswoman. She left when the company was sold to Unilever in 2016.[184] In January 2013, she became the new spokeswoman of Aveeno Skincare.[185] She replaced Daniella van Graas as Aveeno\\'s spokesmodel and became its new \"face\". Reportedly, Aniston is paid \"eight figures\" for her endorsement.[186] She became the new face of Emirates airline in 2015,[187] which was reportedly a success.[188] For pharmaceutical company Shire, she appeared in a 2016 campaign raising awareness about chronic dry eye.[189][190] She appeared in the 1996 Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers music video for \"Walls\", and in 2001, in Melissa Etheridge\\'s music video for \"I Want to Be in Love\".[191][unreliable source?] She also appeared in a Heineken commercial.[172] Along with Brad Pitt and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures, Aniston founded the film production company Plan B Entertainment in 2002,[192] although she and Grey withdrew in 2005.[193][194] In 2008, she and producer Kristin Hahn formed Echo Films.[195] Aniston has been a celebrity advocate for numerous charities and received attention for her own donations. She has appeared in television commercials for St. Jude\\'s Children\\'s Research Hospital, and hosted September 2008\\'s Stand Up to Cancer show.[196] In the \"It Can\\'t Wait\" campaign to free Burma, Aniston directed and starred in a video.[197] She is a supporter of Friends of El Faro, a nonprofit organization that helps raise money for Casa Hogar Sion, an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico.[198] On April 14, 2007, Aniston received GLAAD\\'s Vanguard Award for her contributions to increased visibility and understanding of the LGBT community.[199] In 2013, she was named the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF) ambassador for the Saks Fifth Avenue Key to the Cure campaign, which raises funds for the EIF Women\\'s Cancer Research Fund.[200] In 2015, she supported the Comic Relief, Inc. charity.[201] Other charities that Aniston has publicly supported include Clothes Off Our Back, Feeding America, EB Medical Research Foundation, Project A.L.S., OmniPeace, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.[202] Aniston donated $500,000 to Doctors Without Borders, Haitian health care provider Partners in Health and AmeriCares,[203][204] and also participated in the Hope for Haiti Now telethon. She donated $500,000 to the Red Cross and another $500,000 to the Ricky Martin Foundation in 2017 to help victims of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.[205] After being honored by SmartWater in 2016 for her ongoing philanthropic work for St. Jude\\'s, Aniston spoke of the importance of philanthropy in her life to InStyle magazine: \"We live an extremely beautiful, fortunate life being able to do what we get to do for a living. And so it\\'s a way of being able to be in a position to do something for people who are less able. It\\'s something that makes my heart smile.\"[206] Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Golden Globe Award nominations, and nine SAG Award nominations for her role in Friends. From these, she won one of each. She also garnered a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her guest appearance in 30 Rock, while her performance in Cake earned her nominations at the Golden Globe and SAG awards. Aniston additionally won a SAG Award and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award for the first season of The Morning Show, and earned multiple nominations at Critics\\' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards for its latter seasons. As a producer, she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and three Golden Globe Awards. According to review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes and the box-office site Box Office Mojo, Aniston\\'s most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films are Office Space (1999), The Good Girl (2002), Bruce Almighty (2003), Friends with Money (2006), The Break-Up (2006), Marley & Me (2008), Just Go with It (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), We\\'re the Millers (2013), and Dumplin\\' (2018).[207][41] ', 'source_domain': 'en.wikipedia.org', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Aniston', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Apple is making a new TV show starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston', 'content': 'FILED UNDER: Friends stars, reunited! In 2019, probably. Apple is already making a TV show with Steven Spielberg. Now it’s making another one with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. The show doesn’t have a name or a proposed air date (though spring of 2019 is a decent bet). But it’s going to be about the morning TV show industry*, and Apple is going to make at least two seasons of it. Apple has been all-but-officially interested in the show since it hit the market this summer (so, reportedly, was Netflix). It’s the second show Apple has officially committed to since it hired Sony TV execs Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June; a month ago, Apple said it would reboot Spielberg’s “Amazing Stories” show from the 1980s. In addition to reuniting Witherspoon and Aniston (Recode resident “Friends” expert Johana Bhuiyan reminds me that Witherspoon guest-starred as Aniston’s sister on that show), the show is important because it illustrates Apple’s focus on landing Very Big Names as it prepares to dive deeply into the TV business. Apple already took a step into TV this year when it created “Planet of the Apps” and a spinoff of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” bit. Now its executives politely chalk up those efforts as experiments, and say they’re ready to get into TV for real. Hence the Sony guys. It’s still unclear why Apple thinks it should make its own TV shows and what its distribution plans will be for the ones it does make. But for now it seems to view them as family-friendly brand-burnishing products it can use to highlight its video capabilities. * If you remember that CNN’s Brian Stelter once wrote a book about the real-life stories behind the morning news, then you get a gold star.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': \"Here's What Jennifer Aniston Eats in a Day to Feel Strong and Vibrant\", 'content': 'Plus, discover the 50-something-year-old actress\\'s favorite dinner party menu when she\\'s in charge of hosting.   Whether you know her from her time as Rachel Green on the TV show Friends, the love interest in movies like Rumor Has It, The Object of My Affection and Marley & Me, or, more recently, as Alex Levy on Apple TV+\\'s The Morning Show, chances are, you know Jennifer Aniston. But did you know that the actress and hair care entrepreneur is in her 50s? Looking at least a decade younger, it\\'s no wonder Aniston is a spokesperson for wellness-minded brands like Vital Proteins and Aveeno. We\\'ll have what she\\'s having—well, unless it\\'s the same salad every.single.day. ICYMI, Aniston was known to bring the same salad each and every day of filming Friends to share with co-stars and pals-in-real-life Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow (we have the recipe here!). But the fact that Aniston is such a creature of habit in some areas of her life has served her well. Case in point—her dedication to yoga, which she has practiced for more than a decade, and her daily 10- to 20-minute meditation habit. When she was selected as PEOPLE magazine\\'s \"World\\'s Most beautiful woman\" of 2016, she admitted that she started to follow the lead of her yoga practice, allowing for much more flexibility beyond that staple salad. \"I\\'m not as strict as I was. It was always sort of a monitored watch. Then I thought, \\'Just give yourself moderation.\\'\" To Aniston, beauty is \"learning to love every single thing about yourself. And also realizing that it\\'s not just clothes and what\\'s happening [on the outside]. There\\'s so much more that\\'s beautiful in a human being.\" That said, she is still cognizant of what she consumes. \"We\\'ve got to really be conscious and mindful around what we put inside our bodies. And how we sleep and how we eat and how we take care of ourselves,\" Aniston adds to PEOPLE. Read on to discover the foods and drinks Aniston mindfully chooses to help her feel her best. Spoiler alert: It\\'s much more than the same ol\\' salad. Every day starts with a glass of hot water with lemon, then usually a cup of coffee with a splash of milk and stevia, she tells PEOPLE. Alongside, she\\'ll fuel up with avocado and eggs with a little coconut oil, oatmeal with egg whites whipped in for some extra protein and a \"fluffy texture that\\'s delicious,\" Aniston tells Elle—or a sippable meal like this Chocolate Protein Shake. The lineup for the blender beverage might change a bit throughout the week, but generally includes \"some sort of pure protein, then bananas, blueberries, frozen cherries, stevia, a vegetable mix of dynamic greens that goes in there, maca powder and a little cacao,\" Aniston tells Well + Good. \"There\\'s a collagen peptide that I\\'ve been loving—I\\'ve been seeing a difference! My nails are stronger, and there\\'s a healthier...glow. It\\'s sort of that working from the inside-out thing.\" It\\'s worth mentioning that Aniston has a partnership with Vital Proteins, which is also one of our dietitian\\'s favorite collagen powders. Lunch is \"some form of vegetables or salad with protein—pretty basic,\" she tells Elle. But just because it\\'s basic doesn\\'t mean Aniston leaves it up to chance. She plans ahead to make it possible to toss something nutritious together even during the busiest of days. \"I always have cut raw vegetables in a Tupperware container. Hard-boiled eggs are always great to have in the fridge, as well as a big head of butter lettuce. I also include protein, such as pulled chicken,\" she tells Yahoo Food. When it comes time to transform that into a meal, it might be that chicken or seared ahi tuna with a salad, or a chicken burger tucked inside a lettuce wrap, she reveals to Harper\\'s Bazaar. One thing you\\'ll never find in her fridge? Beets. \"I\\'m not a fan. And you won\\'t find caviar. Nope, you can\\'t acquire that taste no matter how many people say that,\" adds Aniston. To stay energized between meals, Aniston drinks plenty of water and snacks on a healthy carb source and/or something that packs a protein punch. An apple with almond butter, a cheese stick, a handful of nuts or a cup of soup are on frequent rotation. Dinner is where Aniston really lets her creativity shine. Typically, her evening meal also includes a vegetable and a protein, although she goes on kicks when she\\'s in the mood for Mexican food—margaritas included, just \"clean, no sugar,\" she tells InStyle. She enjoys having pals over for a DIY pizza night potluck with wine pairings, too. \"Everyone can participate and make their own pizzas. I have one friend that brings sweets and dessert; other people bring wine. One year, a friend brought all of the pizza dough that we used for the party, so that was fun,\" she tells Yahoo Food. Pasta is also a favorite, be it a low-carb swap like zoodles with pesto and roasted chicken or the real-deal noodles in a carbonara-style sauce. Her lightened-up version of carbonara features turkey bacon instead of pork, eggs and Parmesan. \"No oil, butter or creams. And we use pasta water to make it juicier,\" she explains to Yahoo Food (Giada De Laurentiis would be so proud!). Rather than turning to the more restrictive diets that she dabbled in through the years—including the Grapefruit Diet and Nutrisystem—any time Aniston feels like she\\'s veering off track from a meal plan that makes her feel like her best and most vibrant self, she does a minor course correction. \"If anything, my exercise usually increases a little bit, and I keep the sodium super low. But again, because my diet\\'s good all year round, I don\\'t do a big reset,\" explains Aniston to Yahoo Food. \"I don\\'t let eating habits get out of control where I need a reset button. My general philosophy is to eat healthy. It\\'s pretty clear: Eat as much organic fruits and veggies as you can, keep sugar [intake] low, drink tons and tons of water and get good sleep. I allow myself to indulge once in a while...I don\\'t give myself any rules anymore.\" If you ask us, having zero rules looks great on Jen, and her well-balanced, vegetable-strong, protein-rich menu seems like just one element of her healthy lifestyle that can definitely last a lifetime—a beautiful, delicious, long lifetime. \"I think our bodies are beautiful, and I think celebrating them and being comfortable in them—no matter what age you are—is important,\" Aniston told Harper\\'s Bazaar in 2019. \"There shouldn\\'t be any kind of shame or discomfort around it.\" We couldn\\'t agree more.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': ' ', 'content': 'by habituallychic Rene Russo’s wardrobe in The Thomas Crown Affair used to be my favorite movie wardrobe inspiration but that was before I fell in love with everything that Jennifer Aniston wears in each episode of The Morning Show. It actually reminds me of what I used to wear in the corporate world when I moved to New York 18 years ago, except my clothes were from J.Crew and Banana Republic. Jennifer Aniston’s character Alex Levy is dressed in cashmere suits and sweaters from Max Mara and other luxury brands. It’s nicer than anything any of the real network morning show anchors wear on their shows and is a great example of how to exude professionalism in the workplace even if everything is falling apart. Jennifer actually had a hand in choosing her clothes which are tailored and monochromatic with an occasional pop of color. It wasn’t very clear from Apple TV on how many episodes this season of The Morning Show would air. I thought it was just the three online so far but it turns out that a new episode will every Friday from now until December 20, 2019. They’ve already started working on season two and I can’t wait to see what’s to come from this intelligent and compelling new series. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever seen Jennifer Aniston act so beautifully before. She said it was the hardest thing she’s ever done and you can tell from the emotion she exudes on screen. It’s no wonder her character who is going through so much and has to awake five days a week at 3:30am would want to wrap themself up in cashmere on the way to work. I love the fashions just as much as the show and have put together some inspiring outfits from Jennifer Aniston’s wardrobe that are perfect for work and weekends. Everything she wears makes me want to throw all the pattern out of my closest and stop buying crap from Zara. It might make you want to do the same. When we first see Jennifer Aniston’s character, she’s waking up at 3:30am and getting ready for work. It’s funny how her beauty routing reminds me of the beginning of Mommie Dearest when Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford does the same. Because it’s April in New York and she doesn’t actually get dressed for the show until she arrives at the studio, she wears comfy clothes and sneakers while packing all her work essentials into a chic bag. I’m pretty sure that the camel coat that she wears is the Theory Cashmere Coat that is mostly sold out. Keep in mind that movies and television shows shoot a year before they air so I’ve tried to find the closest match when the exact item isn’t available. I love this Weekend Max Mara coat for its similar style but it’s double faced wool. If you need something warmer try the madame coat, single breasted midi coat or  oversized wool and cashmere-blend coat. The wife of Steve Carell’s character wears a camel Weekend Max Mara double faced wool jacket when we briefly see her. Because it’s still chilly in New York, Jennifer’s character wears lots of cozy sweaters like this S Max Mara wool and cashmere sweater. I also like this wool cashmere chunky sweater. You also can’t go wrong with any sweater from Everlane. These black high-rise wide-leg stretch-jersey trousers look comfy for an early morning ride to work. I think it’s so refreshing that she wears white leather sneakers with multiple outfits. Alex Levy, Jennifer’s character, carries Valextra bags exclusively. She carried the Valextra Brera large leather top handle bag with this outfit. When we see Alex Levy for her first broadcast after the shocking news breaks, she is trying to pull it together emotionally and having her outfit look pulled together probably helps. The actual blazer she wears is the Dior Bar jacket in wool and silk with a $4,100 price tag that doesn’t even include the pants. Other similar options I like are below. Another expensive option with the same shape is this Loro Piana cashmere blazer but I also like the Pallas single-breasted wool-twill blazer and Raey oversized single-breasted wool Harris-tweed blazer. Alex always wears trousers since the desk is clear and there can’t be any wardrobe malfunctions on morning television. These Max Mara Studio navy trousers are classic but the silver trim makes them a little more interesting. Theory is also a great place to find trousers for work. While she wear sneakers to work, Alex always wears heels like these navy suede pumps on air. Her on air outfits don’t require a handbag but I imagined that if she had to go to a lunch meeting after the show, she’d carry this Valextra Medium Colorblock Calf Leather Top Handle Bag. This is my favorite look that Alex Levy wears to work on the second morning we see her. I love whoever styles the outfits and they way they tied the sweater around her neck like a scarf. We don’t actually see the bottom of her outfit so I took the liberty of picking out other pieces she might wear. April is probably one of the best months in New York for double faced wool coats like this Theory double faced coat and for those of you who live in milder climates like California and the south. It’s weirdly hard to find a nice brown sweater. You could splurge on this oversized cashmere sweater from The Row, this Max Mara Wool Cashmere Sweater, or something in a different shade from Everlane or J.Crew. Alex Levy is not going to wear a white tee shirt from Hanes. She’s going to wear a white tee shirt like this organic cotton jersey top or this one. You can only see a little bit of the top of her pants in the scene where she wear this outfit so I imagined that she might wear these Cashmere Relaxed Lounge Pants on her way to work. She’d probably just wear her white sneakers but I’d also like to think she might wear these cashmere, suede and leather sneakers. A less expensive option are these New Balance sneakers. This Khaite envelope pleat medium leather tote definitely looks like a bag Alex Levy would carry. Someone said there were glad to see the character wearing glasses to read as any person over the age of 40 might have to do. These Gucci round-frame tortoiseshell acetate optical glasses are a chic pair but you can never go wrong at Warby Parker. I won’t give it away but this is what Alex wears for an outing in the rain. When she takes her coat off, you can clearly see the plaid lining of her classic Burberry trench coat. Every woman should have one in their closet. Alex wears a black cashmere hoodie and matching pants under the trench. I’m sure hers are Max Mara but you can find similar from many other places. I like these cashmere sweatpants but it looks like the matching cashmere sweatshirt just sold out. You could pair it with the cashmere crewneck sweater or try Naked Cashmere Colette Sweater and matching Katherine Jogger Pants. I also really like this Skin wool-blend hooded sweater and matching wool-blend trousers. They’d be great for traveling. She’d probably wear impractical shoes like these suede and leather collapsible-heel sneakers. These are two more on air outfits that are great workwear inspiration. It also looks like everything in her on air closet can be mixed and matched to make more options since it’s almost all shades of gray, navy, and black. As you know I love a bow tie blouse. This Max Mara blouse has a subtle patten which gives it a little interest. This navy Max Mara Studio bow tie blouse matches the Max Mara Studio navy trousers above. These stretch-wool flared pants look like the perfect work trouser to wear with heels. Alex wears this exact Theory featherweight grey sweater on the show but it’s mostly sold out because it’s from a previous season. You could also try this cashmere v-neck sweater and this cashmere v-neck sweater. This Joseph cashmere sweater is a similar weight to the original. These Italian stretch wool trousers are another great work pant. I bought these last year and had my tailor add belt loops. Every woman should also have a black suede pump in their closet in the heel height that works best for them. It’s funny that Alex Levy doesn’t even wear a dress to a formal affair. Instead she wears pants in the form of a jumpsuit to the event at which she’s being honored. I wonder if it’s because she’s in such a male dominated industry. Regardless, it’s an amazing outfit. The red strapless silk crepe jumpsuit is from Valentino and not available in many sizes since the show aired. I also love this Victoria Beckham mesh-paneled cady gown in the same shade of red. This is the exact Michael Kors Collection Double-Face Cashmere Melton Trench Robe Coat that she wears over her Valentino jumpsuit. The good news is that it’s on sale. The bad news is that most sizes are gone. This Max Mara Vincent Long Button-Front Double-Face Wool Coat is very similar and available in all sizes. I also like this red double-breasted wool-blend coat to wear with grey outfits and this red Long Wool Blend Trench Coat is a great price. You can’t see what shoes she’s wearing but these red suede sandals look like a perfect match. Update: One of the stylists for the show just posted a behind the scenes photo of this outfit and shows she’s these red Gianvito Rossi suede pumps. She carries this exact Jimmy Choo J Box Clutch which is also a perfect match to the jumpsuit. When she’s in the car, she’s moving things from this Valextra bag to the clutch. She wears $13,000 Elie Top drop earrings with the dress but I love these gold-plated pearl earrings as much more reasonably priced option. She wears this big round watch with a red band like this IWC SCHAFFHAUSEN Portofino watch with her red dress. She actually wears big round watches through out the show so they must have made a product placement deal. Update: I found out that the watches Alex Levy wears are all from Chopard. She wears the Chopard L.U.C XPS 40MM automatic watch in rose gold with a custom red brushed fabric strap by Chopard “to both suit the evening occasion and better match Alex’s Valentino jumpsuit.”  The all grey outfit is the one that I already have in my closet. I love grey in the winter because it’s so much less harsh than all black. Jen and I have the same color hair so it’s a good color for us too. This grey Weekend Max Mara wool coat is a great soft option because there is nothing worse than an itchy wool coat. I like this luxurious grey cashmere sweater but the Everlane cashmere sweater is only $100 if you’re looking for a deal. I think it’s important to add some texture and interest to your outfit if you are wearing all grey like these wide-leg pleated pant in wool tweed. I like the subtle ombre of this grey cashmere scarf. This grey cashmere scarf is smaller but also much cheaper. With the grey ensemble, she of course carries a grey Valextra Brera Large Leather Top-Handle Tote Bag. She also carries the Valextra Soft Leather Tote Bag in the burnt orange outfit she wears in the photo down below. I tried to figure out what shoes she is wearing with the grey outfit but I couldn’t figure it out. They look like a navy loafer or oxford but these navy suede and leather sneakers would also work. This IWC SCHAFFHAUSEN Pilot’s Automatic stainless steel and alligator watch would be the perfect complement to the grey outfit and navy shoes. Sleepwear so far has played a big part of the first three episodes of The Morning Show. Jennifer Aniston’s character opens the first episode in striped pajamas similar to these striped cotton-voile pajama set and this striped silk-charmeuse pyjama shirt and matching striped silk-charmeuse pyjama trousers. She wakes up to a view of the city which no morning anchor would ever do. She would have had electric black out shade or worn an eye mask like this navy silk eye mask. She also uses eye patches and a jade face roller in the morning to deff puff and worries if she really has “passed her sell by date” for television. In another episode she wears a matching lounge set of a robe and jogger pants. I can’t find her exact set but this Naked Cashmere robe is very similar. The two middle photos are from the first three episodes and the other four are from episodes to come. As I stated, I’m really enjoying The Morning Show and can’t to watch the next seven episodes. I also can’t wait to see what Jennifer Anison’s character wears. I tried reaching out to the costume designers, Sophie De Rakoff, and Nina and Clare Hallworth, to ask them some questions but I never heard back from any of them. I’d love to chat with them about their wardrobe choices if anyone knows them. Also, I’m not sure how many people know this but a free year of Apple TV is included when you buy a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac after September 10, 2019, from Apple or an Apple-authorized reseller. Your new device must also be capable of running the latest iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or macOS. If you don’t qualify for a free year, Apple TV is $4.99 a month but the first two episodes of The Morning Show are free for anyone to watch online.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Apple TV+ keeps it free', 'content': 'Earlier this summer, as Apple reduced the duration of its Apple TV+ giveaway for eligible device buyers to three months from 12, it appeared the tech giant might be reining in its strategy of building reach by offering its service for free over a generous time period.\\n\\nBut  a new arrangement with T-Mobile, introduced last month, suggested the original theory still holds: Apple TV+ is the service that just keeps giving. Although it was introduced in November 2019 with a $4.99/mo price tag, Apple TV+ rose to scale in another way: as a free giveaway to device buyers. When it launched the service, Apple offered iPhone, Macbook, and other gadget buyers 12 months of free access. Later, Apple extended the largesse on two occasions, in October 2020 and again in January 2021, informing the same customers they could continue to get Apple TV+ free through July 2021. Now, there’s another path to free access: The wireless carrier T-Mobile has introduced a 12-months-free offer for customers (both new and pre-existing) who have T- Mobile’s high-end unlimited wireless plans. What that means is that some early users might not have to pay for the service for the better part of three years. Instead, they can transfer their Apple TV+ subscriptions to T-Mobile, which has assured newcomers it will honor the full 12-month giveaway even to those who already have Apple TV+ sign-in credentials. To be sure, this path to netting 32 months of free access will affect only a subset of the total Apple TV+ user base: those who got in early on the giveaway by buying an iPhone, saw their access deals extended, and now, on the cusp of seeing the giveaways end, take up T-Mobile on the new offer. The remainder of the non-paying Apple TV+ users – say, those who aren’t willing to drop a Verizon wireless plan in favor of T-Mobile – presumably will have to start paying once their freebie periods expire. Loss leader?\\nWe say “presumably” because it’s entirely possible Apple will find new motivation to continue giving the service away. From the start, we’ve seen Apple TV+ as a loss-leader benefit rather than a bid to make money in the streaming video category. This strategy is apparent not just in the willingness to give the service away, but to be unusually permissive with usage, by allowing up to six simultaneous streams from the same account. That said, Apple’s “services” business is mighty. In the April-June period, the group that includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple News, the game service Arcade, and other digital applications generated $17.5 billion in revenue, up 33% from the same period a year earlier. Within this group, though, Apple TV+ is a small contributor. Even if Apple TV+ has racked up 10 million paying subscriptions (we doubt it), the associated annualized revenue would amount to only about $600 million: $5/mo x 10 million x 12 months. Instead, the game for Apple is to achieve global scale in streaming, and then figure out how to monetize it without depending on subscription payments. Today, we estimate there may be as many as 54 million Apple TV+ “subscribers,” defined as people who have working passwords and logins. The percentage of these users who actually pay Apple $4.99/mo to be able to watch hit shows like “Ted Lasso” or the forthcoming Season 2 premiere of the Jennifer Anniston/Reese Witherspoon vehicle “The Morning Show” is small compared with the broader base. Apple sells some 50 million iPhones globally every quarter, with most of these transactions including free access to Apple TV+ (now for three months). That average number of quarterly smartphone buyers, for comparison, is more than Hulu’s entire subscriber base for of 39 million. And the total keeps growing: Although some percentage of device buyers never fire up their allotted Apple TV+ credentials, and others already have credentials, a significant share of device buyers represent net additions for Apple TV+. This recent T-Mobile deal is unlikely to be the last time Apple finds a way to keep Apple TV+ prominent at scale in the modern streaming environment. Although it’s possible other lookalike pairings my crop up with other distributors, there’s no reason these alliances have to be confined to media/telecom. There’s nothing to prevent Apple from teaming up with a large bank, airline company, or any other consumer brand that has broad reach and ongoing relationships with millions of customers. The field of play might even extend all the way to insurance companies or online dating services, for example. What Apple really wants from Apple TV+ is acceleration of the technology replacement cycle. If having access to the new season of “The Morning Show” compels a consumer to buy a new iPhone a month sooner than they might otherwise, Apple wins. Or, imagine the computer user who’s due for a new laptop. If they’re on the fence about what to buy, a tipping point might be the realization that another year of Apple TV+ is available with one platform, but not the other. Although T-Mobile is the latest Apple partner to dangle free access to Apple TV+ as a drawing card for long-term loyalty, it surely won’t be the last.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Apple TV+ unveils teaser for season three of Emmy Award-winning global hit series “The Morning Show,” starring and executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston', 'content': \"Apple TV+ today released a gripping teaser for the highly anticipated third season of “The Morning Show,” starring and executive produced by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. The 10-episode third season of “The Morning Show” will premiere globally on Wednesday, September 13, 2023 with the first two episodes, followed by new episodes every Wednesday through November 8, 2023. In “The Morning Show” season three, the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom. Along with Witherspoon and Aniston, the star-studded season three ensemble cast is led by Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Jon Hamm, Nicole Beharie and Julianna Margulies. The Emmy, SAG and Critics Choice Award-winning drama, which has already received an early renewal for season four, is directed and executive produced by Mimi Leder, with Charlotte Stoudt serving as showrunner and executive producer. The series is produced by the studio Media Res, and executive produced by Michael Ellenberg through Media Res, along with Aniston and Kristin Hahn through Echo Films; Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter through Hello Sunshine. Leder serves as executive producer and director. Now streaming globally on Apple TV+, the broadly acclaimed second season of “The Morning Show” received Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Reese Witherspoon; Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Billy Crudup, who also won the award for season one; and Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series, Marcia Gay Harden.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Why Can’t We Quit “The Morning Show”?', 'content': '  By Inkoo Kang The enduring appeal of “The Morning Show” has become one of the great mysteries of modern television. The Apple TV+ series, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as onetime hosts of a “Today”-like breakfast program titled “The Morning Show,” is simultaneously ripped from the headlines and bewildering to anyone who’s lived through them—in the span of a single episode, Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson chases a story about the erosion of abortion rights and is sent into space live on air. Among critics and casual viewers alike, the response has been one of bafflement and delight. “The morning show is absolutely unlike any tv show I’ve ever seen,” the novelist Rumaan Alam wrote, on X. “It’s like getting a lobotomy, it’s past camp, there should be academics working on this.” The third season, which concluded earlier this month, addressed the war in Ukraine (via a producer’s tortured love affair with a war photographer), the Capitol riot (in which a recurring character was an active participant), and the tyranny of tech billionaires (by having Aniston’s Alex Levy sleep with one of them). Needless to say, it’s already been renewed for a fourth. “The Morning Show” was supposed to be more than a hate-watch. First announced in 2017, the glossy project—an adaptation of the media critic Brian Stelter’s best-selling book “Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV”—was meant to lend Apple’s then-fledgling streaming service instant credibility, in the way that “House of Cards” and “Orange Is the New Black” had done for Netflix. (Personally, I had hoped for a sharp, self-aware exploration of the gilded cage of female likability—a subject that Aniston and Witherspoon, both erstwhile America’s Sweethearts, probably have a lot to say about.) Then NBC’s Matt Lauer was terminated amid accusations of sexual harassment and assault—he admitted to causing “damage” at the network but denied a rape allegation—and a new showrunner, Kerry Ehrin, refashioned “The Morning Show” into a #MeToo melodrama. Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), Alex’s beloved co-anchor, served as Lauer’s fictional counterpart; the series began with the exposure of his crimes, then traced the aftermath of his public dethroning. But the show’s efforts to grapple with these themes eventually tipped into absurdity, not least because of its seeming determination to rehabilitate Mitch. Toward the end of the second season, after spending months in self-imposed exile at an Italian villa, he killed himself by driving off a cliff. In that deeply unserious moment, the new “Morning Show” was born. Goodbye, well-intentioned disappointment. Hello, unexpectedly riveting perversion of endless potential. Alam is right that “The Morning Show” is a unique creation: an objectively bad show that’s somehow also must-watch television. If it falls short of the elevated fare it was meant to be, it owes its appeal to a genre the golden age forgot. The landscape of prestige TV is littered with gritty fantasy series, antihero sagas, and melancholy comedies—but the auteurs of the era have largely left the melodrama untouched. Attempts to repurpose its signature pleasures—namely soapy plotting and immoderate emotionality—have turned out sludgy and self-serious (“Damages,” “Bloodline”) or, once the novelty wears off, numbingly repetitive (“Scandal”). Enter “The Morning Show,” whose heightened characters and approach to very recent history betray its true lineage. Where “The Newsroom,” on HBO, used hindsight for point-scoring and piety—Aaron Sorkin’s avatar routinely made the “right” calls where his real-world counterparts had failed—and “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight,” on CBS and Paramount+, respectively, merged the topical and the theatrical to reflect the absurdities of the present moment, “The Morning Show” mines current events almost exclusively for drama. They’re deployed most often as a source of personal or professional tension—Alex bristles when the in-universe news of her affair with the billionaire Paul Marks (Jon Hamm) eclipses the fall of Roe v. Wade, but the series itself is, naturally, more concerned with the former. To be so close and yet so far from our own world lands us in an emotional and narrative uncanny valley. The use of politics as set dressing has its drawbacks. The show is at its most vexingly coy when it declines to nail down queer West Virginian Bradley’s position on the ideological spectrum, and when it skirts the implications of her brother Hal’s involvement in the Capitol insurrection, which matters only to the extent that it threatens her job and his ability to be present as a father. Whether he believes her to be another venal élitist peddling lies about the outcome of the 2020 election never comes up. But it is perhaps that degree of remove from reality that’s proved so compelling, even as the writers make choices that defy basic storytelling logic. The unlikely friendship between the rough-hewn, perpetually indignant Bradley and the polished, cynical veteran Alex is meant to be the heart of the show—so of course they’re separated for most of the third season, with Alex now the host of a streaming series called “Alex Unfiltered” and Bradley the face of the network’s evening news. Lurching wildly in the quality of its story lines and its treatment of serious issues, “The Morning Show” makes for a uniquely destabilizing viewing experience. From scene to scene, I find myself thinking about it the way one might about an erratic boyfriend: Are things good now? Is this bad patch worth pushing through? Am I an idiot for subjecting myself to this? I’ve become as engrossed by these questions as I am by anything onscreen, and I have a different answer every ten minutes. The January 6th subplot had me howling with incredulousness, then giddily enraptured. Despite, or maybe because of all this, the show is a hit. It’s one of the only Apple TV+ series to crack the Nielsen Top Ten—a success aided, no doubt, by the millions lavished on every frame. Aniston and Witherspoon don’t come cheap, and the gleaming cinematography lends an enviable lustre to both the Gen X cast members and the many elaborate sets. When Bradley briefly leaves Earth in a rocket ship—accompanied by her boss, Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), the head of the network, and Paul, who’s using the suborbital trip as free advertisement for his space-travel firm—and all three actors float about in microgravity, the streamer seems to be showing off. As in any good soap opera, the characters themselves are the reason to keep watching, and their consistently questionable choices have taken on genuine thematic weight: the series has become a meditation on the price of survival. Bradley, who started off as an unrelenting idealist, has since been compromised by her own ambitions, having engaged in a coverup to preserve her career even at the cost of her relationship and her values. Alex, despite having rebranded after the scandal surrounding Mitch, is still plagued by an instinct to adjoin herself to a powerful man—first Cory, then Paul—instead of forging her own path. Aniston’s portrayal of a woman who’s only ever gained power by appeasing various male executives has been the best performance of her career. Cory, too, has always felt one wrong move away from catastrophic ruin. His decisions tend to come as grenades, and the writers evidently relish penning his lines of grandiose thunder; Crudup, who plays him with a rictus grin rivalling that of the Joker, is regularly given pronouncements such as “I want death in the afternoon!” and “Alex Levy is Lazarus, and that makes me Jesus, except I’m in more houses seven days a week.” But the third season rounds him out with an embittered, mercurial mother (Lindsay Duncan, in a very Lindsay Duncan role) who appears to be both the root and the first victim of his transactional world view. Most satisfyingly, Cory develops a genuine protectiveness toward his staff once he finally accepts that he can’t be a chaos agent and an effective leader at the same time. He still irritates the people around him as often as he charms them, but the sheer volume of quips per minute and the absolute conviction with which they’re delivered are undeniable. He thrives in self-made bedlam; whatever the circumstances, he manages to carry off a heady mix of self-indulgence and self-importance. In other words, he’s prime “Morning Show” material. ♦ A reporter’s relationship with Kurt Cobain, before and after the singer’s death. Who owns London’s most mysterious mansion?

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston Net Worth', 'content': 'Jennifer Aniston is an American actress, producer and spokeswoman who has a net worth of $320 million. At this point, it probably goes without saying that Jennifer Aniston is one of the most famous and highly sought-after comedic actresses in Hollywood. She consistently earns $20+ million per year from acting and endorsements. She is probably still most famous for her role on the sitcom Friends but has also managed to carve out a very respectable film career in the two decades. Jennifer Aniston was born in Sherman Oaks, California, and raised in New York City. She moved to Los Angeles in 1989 and worked a variety of part-time jobs before landing her first television roles. From 1994 to 2004, she starred as Rachel Green on the long-running sitcom \"Friends,\" a role that turned Jennifer Aniston into a household name (and the basis of a popular haircut). She won an Emmy in 2002 and a Golden Globe in 2003. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons of the show, Aniston and her female co-stars each earned $1 million per episode, making them the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. Coinciding with and following her time on Friends, she has appeared in a variety of films, notably Bruce Almighty, Along Came Polly, The Break-Up, and the independent drama The Good Girl, which earned her praise in the critical media and hefty paychecks. She has continued to have success with the more recent films We\\'re the Millers, Office Christmas Party, Netflix\\'s Murder Mystery movies, and Apple TV\\'s The Morning Show. Getty After receiving an enormous salary bump ahead of the seventh season (as detailed below) Jennifer was instantly propelled to one of the highest-paid actresses in the world. She has ranked on the list every year since. She was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2003, with $21 million in total earnings. Today, she consistently earns $25-30 million per year. Between 1997 and 2011 alone, she earned $75 million from film paychecks. For much of that time, she commanded $8 million per movie. One of Jennifer\\'s highest film paychecks was the $10 million she made from 2011\\'s Just Go With It. Jennifer is one of the most sought-after celebrity endorsers in the world. Over the years, she has earned a fortune endorsing brands like L\\'Oreal, Smartwater, Emirates, Eyelove, and Aveeno. Today, Jennifer makes around $10 million per year from endorsements alone. She has also created six fragrances (as of this writing). (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images) For the first season of Friends, each cast member earned $22,500 per episode. That works out to $540,000 for the first season. Their salaries were boosted to $40,000 per episode in the second season. That works out to $960,000 for the second season. Ahead of the third season, when their contracts were up, the cast banded together to negotiate as a group. They ended up with a deal that paid $75,000 per episode of season three ($1.875 million for the season), $85,000 for season 4 ($2.04 million), $100,000 for season 5 ($2.5 million) and $125,000 in season 6 ($3.125 million). Ahead of season 7, the cast negotiated for a massive raise. They each ended up earning $750,000 per episode in seasons 7 and 8 ($18 million per season). For seasons 9 and 10, each cast member earned $1 million per episode. That works out to $24 million for season 9 and $18 million for season 10. If you total it all up, each cast member of Friends earned around $90 million in base salary alone from the show before backend bonuses and ongoing royalties. As part of their 2000 contract negotiations, the cast was able to demand backend points on the show, which would allow them to earn royalties off the show\\'s sale into syndication. Up to that point, the only other TV stars who had ownership stakes in shows were Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby. Friends continues to generate north of $1 billion per year in syndication royalties and streaming deals. It has been reported that each cast member in some years can earn $10-20 million in royalties alone. (Photo by Vinnie Zuffante/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) For her role on the Apple TV show \"The Morning Show,\" both Jennifer and her co-star Reese Witherspoon earned $1.25 million per episode. As of this writing, that\\'s the fifth-highest amount of money ever paid to an actor on a per-episode basis. In 2000, Aniston married longtime boyfriend Brad Pitt in an elaborate ceremony in Malibu. The two split in 2005 and Aniston has since been linked with a series of Hollywood actors including Vince Vaughn and singer John Mayer. For a number of years, she was romantically linked to actor/writer Justin Theroux. They began dating in May 2011, got engaged in August 2012, and were married in August 2015. But the couple split at the end of 2017. In January 2012, Jennifer spent $20.1 million to buy a home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles. This house sits on 3.25 acres of property. Built in the mid-60s, the 8,500 square-foot home sports four bedrooms, six bathrooms, another 1/2 bath, and open-plan design. Floor-to-ceiling windows allow in lots of light and provide completely clear views of the ocean and the surrounding city. The substantial estate also holds a swimming pool, a separate guesthouse, and a private vineyard. Additionally, the estate has a large area for cars and a series of walls that afford the owner almost total privacy. In 2006, shortly after her divorce from Brad Pitt, Jennifer spent $13.5 million on a home in Beverly Hills, which she proceeded to remodel from the ground up at a cost of several million dollars. She sold this house in 2011 for $35 million. Jennifer also owns at least $10 million worth of property in New York City. Jennifer\\'s Manhattan apartment is one of 23 in an exclusive building. The unit spans more than half the whole floor at 2,873 square feet of living space. It has three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, with the master bedroom offering views of Gramercy Park. The entire condo is filled with floor-to-ceiling windows and vaulted ceilings reaching as high as 11.8 feet up. This spreads natural light across the hardwood floors throughout the home. Additional features include a wood-burning fireplace, spa-like bathrooms, a powder room, a walk-in master closet, and top-of-the-line Miele appliances. This building is part of the Gramercy luxury boutique hotel, which gives Jennifer Aniston access to the hotel\\'s 5-star services and amenities. Included with her purchase are housekeeping, valet service, room service, butler service, catering, event planning, car detailing service, personal shopping, and a delivery service. She also gets a free membership to the hotel\\'s high-end David Barton Gym and Spa and access to Gramercy Park, Manhattan\\'s only private park. This list of services get thrown into the $11,000 monthly HOA fee. In 2022, Aniston purchased a $15 million Montecito farmhouse from Oprah Winfrey. Her neighbors are Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, and Ariana Grande.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': \"Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon's Friendship Timeline\", 'content': 'They go back more than 20 years.  GETTY Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon\\'s friendship dates all the way back to 2000. The same year that Michelle Williams first joined Destiny\\'s Child, reality TV wasn\\'t yet mainstream, and a new episode of Friends came on the airwaves every Thursday night. It all began when Witherspoon had a guest-starring role on the NBC sitcom as Rachel Green\\'s self-absorbed little sister, Jill. \"I was 23 years old and had just had a baby. I was nursing Ava on set, and Jen just kept going, \\'You have a baby?\\' I was like, \\'I know, it’s weird,\\' Reese recalled of their first meeting during a 2019 interview with Harper\\'s Bazaar, adding: \"She was so sweet to me...We’ve been friends ever since.\" While Witherspoon only appeared on two episodes, she and Aniston kept in touch over the years and would later co-star together again in the Emmy-nominated series The Morning Show. Here, take a look back to see how Aniston and Witherspoon went from on-screen sisters to real-life BFFs with their complete friendship timeline. GETTY Back in 2000, Reese guest-starred on two episodes of Friends as Aniston\\'s character Rachel Green\\'s younger sister, Jill. Admittedly, Witherspoon was nervous about her TV debut and flubbed one of her lines. \"In all my enthusiasm, I completely forgot something very crucial—that I had never been on television ever before in my entire life, and I never really had been in front of a live audience before ever in my entire life. I panicked. I totally froze. It became immediately clear to me that I had no idea what I was doing and I was completely out of my league,\" Witherspoon said during Elle\\'s Women in Hollywood event in 2011, revealing that Aniston was the one who offered some reassurance. \"\\'Don\\'t try to be perfect, just be yourself,\\'\" Witherspoon remembered Aniston telling her. And from that point on, the two became, yes, friends. GETTY While Witherspoon never returned to Friends, she and Aniston caught up several years later at the Couture Cares fashion show benefiting the Revlon/UCLA Breast Center in 2005. GETTY Witherspoon honored Aniston at Elle\\'s 18th Annual Women in Hollywood event with a gushing tribute to her longtime friend. \"On one hand, she is this gorgeous, breathtaking beauty that men lose their thought process and their speech patterns [over],\" Reese said. \"I\\'ve actually seen this. It\\'s incredible when they see her. And, on the other hand, she is a woman who lets you in.\" She then joked, \"There\\'s not that many people actually that have this incredible combination of sex appeal and complete lovability. You just want to get your nails done with her, and you want to make out with her at the same time...at least I do!\" GETTY The besties ran into each other at Vanity Fair\\'s famed Oscar after-party while unknowingly coordinating in strapless gowns. Reese, for her part, wore a royal blue Louis Vuitton dress with a bustier bodice, while Jen opted for a crimson number by Valentino. GETTY Jennifer presented Reese with the 2015 American Cinematheque Award, which recognizes “an extraordinary artist in the entertainment industry currently making a significant contribution to the Art of the Moving Picture.”  \"Even before Reese played my lovely, albeit somewhat spoiled, sister Jill, she somehow felt like family to me,\" Aniston said in her speech before praising her \"absolutely extraordinary\" performance for The Man in the Moon. \"Reese\\'s amazing talent, both professionally and personally, has long made her a very strong and welcome presence in my life—and I\\'m sure in many people\\'s lives in this room.\" GETTY Nearly 20 years since starring on-screen together in Friends, Jen and Reese reunited on the Apple TV+ series The Morning Show, in which Jen takes on the role of seasoned anchor Alex Levy and Reese portrays newcomer Bradley Jackson. Aniston previously opened up about how easy it was working with Witherspoon again while speaking with People, telling the magazine, \"It sort of just fell into place because she’s so damn good, and there was sort of an unspoken language,” Aniston explained. “We were really a good yin-yang to each other.” Jen and Reese took a walk down memory lane and reenacted a tense argument they shared during one of their scenes together on Friends. In the episode titled \"The One Where Chandler Can\\'t Cry,\" Witherspoon and Aniston\\'s characters get into an argument at Central Perk over Jill wanting to date Rachel\\'s on-and-off boyfriend, Ross. While looking at an old photo from the set, Aniston asked Witherspoon, \"Is this where you say the line that you love so much?\" \"Well, we could say the lines,\" Witherspoon replied. \"Do you remember your line?\" Aniston remarked, \"I say, \\'You can\\'t have Ross.\\'\" \"\\'Can\\'t have? Can\\'t have?\" Witherspoon fired back. \"The only thing I can\\'t have is dairy.\\'\" During a joint interview with Variety, The Morning Show co-stars reminisced on their decades-long friendship and working relationship. “We’ve been in each other’s lives for 20-something years,” Aniston shared. “It’s just in our DNA that we are collaborators. We’re partners. We’re friends. We’re girlfriends. We share all sorts of heartbreaks in life and love and everything.” Reese added, \"There’s a comfort to that. It’s just mutual respect and years of experience. And I think we’re both incredulous that we’re both still kicking around!\" GETTY Aniston and Witherspoon had a cute BFF moment on the red carpet at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards. They twinned in head-to-toe black, with Reese wearing a strapless Celine dress with a leg slit and Jennifer trading her signature LBD for a little black jumpsuit with a feathered bodice and a sweeping train.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': \"Review: In 'The Morning Show' season 3, Jennifer Aniston has never been better\", 'content': 'Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure of watching “The Morning Show” new season. Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure of watching “The Morning Show,” now streaming its third delicious season (a fourth is on the books) on Apple TV+, where it’s better than ever at mixing superficial smarts with shameless silliness. You gotta love it. And I’m not ashamed to say I do. But is “The Morning Show” something more than the mindless fluff of its reputation? It’s a question the third season makes well worth considering. When last seen in season two, Jennifer Aniston’s Alex Levy had turned her bout with COVID-19 into must-see TV and a streaming show called “Alex Unfiltered,” in which she could fire questions at world leaders. Meanwhile, Reese Witherspoon’s Bradley Jackson fulfilled her ambition to anchor the UBA Evening News, watched mostly by grandparents of the preferred youth demographic. While Alex and Bradley think deep thoughts, the fictional Morning Show cedes its ratings-friendly frivolity to weatherman Yanko Flores (Nestor Carbonell) and newcomer Chris Hunter (Nicole Beharie), the latter an Olympic gold medalist smarting over being told to smile and look pretty. The devil remains CEO Cory Ellison, played by Billy Crudup – still the only acting Emmy winner on the series – whose demonic dazzle just keeps getting more brash and beguiling. Corey knows legacy TV is on the ropes and the only way to get board chairman Cybil Richards (the great Holland Taylor) off his back is to find a buyer for UBA.  Enter Elon Musk. Actually, it’s “Mad Men” hottie Jon Hamm as Paul Marks, a tech billionaire who wants to buy the beleaguered network and sell it off for spare parts to finance his personal space program. He’d also like to rocket Alex into bed. Though the star-on-star chemistry between Aniston and Hamm truly sizzles, it’s tricky business for the icons they’re playing. The same goes for Bradley’s on-and-off romance with outed journalist Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies). Their affair triggers a conflict about Bradley’s addict brother, Hal (Joe Tippett), and a plot thread about the January 6 insurrection that proves too thorny for this series to handle. Season three does way better with the inter-office tensions ignited by a data hack that goes viral about UBA salaries, performance reviews, and racist and sexist comments. Cheers to Karen Pittman as showrunner Mia Jordan, and especially to Greta Lee, the radiant star of “Past Lives,” who crushes every scene as Stella Bak, the news chief with a killer instinct at war with her sense of fair play. As ever, “The Morning Show” juggles more balls than it can keep airborne, but at least it’s onto something about our broken media landscape. Sure, the series lacks the financial savvy of “Billions,” the satirical bite of “Network” and the brutal artistry of “Succession,” which shows familial corruption eating away at business and personal ethics. But it’s in there pitching. You can feel it in the way UBA journalists resist the lid advertisers put on reporting about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, and the racial animosity at the core of reshaping voting rights. All this, in a series critically drubbed for its lightweight content and watchable stupidity.  Season three makes a solid case for reassessing “The Morning Show” as more than escapist fun passing as social commentary. Former showrunner Kerry Ehrin has ceded control to Charlotte Stoudt, though with Mimi Leder staying on as lead director, the focus is stronger than ever on the challenges women face in the workplace. Aniston has never been better, letting us see the cost to Alex as she walks the tightrope between ambition and becoming someone she can’t recognize. As she and Witherspoon face each other in the tenth and final season three episode, Alex and Bradley enter a world of squeezed options that is all too recognizable as our own. Behind this look at airbrushed, on-air personalities disseminating news filtered through the politics and greed of corporate high-rollers lies a sense that the truth matters, and that fighting for it is a laudable way to face the future. Fantasy? Maybe. But also quietly revolutionary. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ', 'source_domain': 'abcnews.go.com', 'url': 'https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/review-morning-show-season-3-jennifer-aniston/story?id=103182643', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The stars on The Morning Show look insane', 'content': \" Jennifer Aniston officially went overboard with cosmetic surgery. She’s got puppet mouth and constantly looks surprised or angry because all the face lifts have stretched her eyes wide open. They probably don’t close all the way when she’s asleep. The woman is 54 years old and there is not a single line on her face. It’s bumming me out. Then there’s Nestor Carbonelli (the weatherman) who is not only wearing too much eyeliner but also now more mascara than Lady Gaga. Check out his short scene in S03E02 if you don’t believe me. The vanity of these people. Jennifer and Reese appear to have filters on their face when no one else does and it’s really distracting. Nestor has very dark and thick lashes, so he's always looked like he's wearing mascara (seriously check out all his work dating back to the 90s). But yes, Jennifer and Reese both have heavy filters. Its uncanny. I remember he got asked about it all the time back when he was on Lost and getting called the Maybeline Man. It must have got annoying after a while. Not that I'm not insanely jealous. Jennifer Aniston takes amazing care of herself. She looks awesome. Yes and she doesn’t need filters or anymore surgery. Well Jennifer’s face makes sense, she is always angry in the show Her body, her choice. Let’s not shame women for their looks 🤷\\u200d♀️ I agree. I've quite surprised by the number of attacks on appearance I've seen in this subreddit. I honestly think it's digitally altered, like they did roto smoothing on her skin. It's unnatural and so distracting!! I do think it is strange filtering on Jen and Reese's faces. Everything looks a little smooth in their close ups, different lighting and such used. I don't know what it is, but it looks unnatural this season.          \", 'source_domain': 'www.reddit.com', 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMorningShow/comments/16mdswi/the_stars_on_the_morning_show_look_insane/', 'copyright': ''}\n",

The Apple TV+ series starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston has returned for its third season, launching into new terrain for the titular morning news program, its network, and the people who keep it running. After tackling the COVID pandemic in season 2 and the aftermath of a sexual assault scandal in season 1, season 3 presents a new set of challenges, including covering abortion rights, the network’s possible acquisition by a tech billionaire, and (*checks notes*) space. Apple also teases that this season, “Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom.” The intrigue. Plus, this chapter welcomes new cast members including Jon Hamm (as investor Paul Marks), Nicole Beharie (as new anchor Christina Hunter), Natalie Morales, and Tig Notaro. The Morning Show has already been renewed for a fourth season, so there’s more to look forward to after this ride. But in the meantime, here’s how to tune into season 3.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': ' ', 'content': 'by habituallychic I wrote the post Outfits Inspired by Jennifer Aniston’s Wardrobe on The Morning Show almost exactly a year ago and I keep thinking about how much of what Jennifer’s character, Alex Levy, wears would be perfect for working from home. When I first posted about her outfits, I scoured the internet to find the exact pieces she wore which were often from high end designers like Max Mara and Valextra. This time, I’ve kept a few of the luxury splurge items but swapped out most of them with more affordable options. I wrote before that her clothes are a “great example of how to exude professionalism in the workplace even if everything is falling apart.” How apropos is that for our current climate?! When we first see Jennifer Aniston’s character in The Morning Show, she’s waking up at 3:30am and getting ready for work as one of the anchors of a morning television news program. It’s funny how her beauty routine reminds me of the beginning of Mommie Dearest when Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford does the same. Because it’s chilly in New York and she doesn’t actually get dressed for the show until she arrives at the studio, she wears comfy clothes and sneakers while packing all her work essentials into a chic bag. I had one person ask me for an outfit that could work for Zoom meetings and walking the dog and I think this is perfect for both. All of her coats on the show seem to be one of the Max Mara, Max Mara Studio, Max Mara Weekend, S Max Mara, or Theory but because it was filmed over a year ago, not everything she wore is still available. I love this wool-blend double-breasted coat as a splurge option and other less expensive options include this Double Breasted Wool Blend Coat, Slim Tailored Coat, Classic Camel Wool Topcoat. This oversized wool and cashmere-blend sweater looks very similar to the one on the show and the Recycled Cashmere Crewneck Sweater is a less expensive option. You could always jazz it up for a Zoom call by wrapping a patterned silk scarf around your neck. A crepe jogger pant would be comfortable for working at home all day. Jennifer Aniston’s character carries the Valextra Brera Leather Top Handle Bag which is very luxurious brand. This large textured-leather tote is a much less expensive bag option. I’m sure the Alex Levy character probably wear Common Projects Leather Sneakers but these white Essential Sneakers are just as chic and less expensive. These low top sneakers are also a great option. This is my favorite look that Alex Levy wears to work on the second morning we see her. I love whoever styles the outfits and they way they tied the sweater around her neck like a scarf. We don’t actually see the bottom of her outfit so I took the liberty of picking out other pieces she might wear. I love this neutral color for a coat. The original style is sold out but this Wool & Cashmere Trench Coat is a great alternative. There’s also a shorter Belted Wool Blend Jacket that’s a cross between a blazer and a coat. You could wrap this brown Recycled Cashmere Crewneck Sweater around your neck like a scarf like Jennifer Aniston’s character or pair it with lounge pants or jeans. Alex Levy would probably wear this white ribbed cotton top but the Slim Perfect Long Sleeve T-shirt is a much more reasonably priced version. It’s also available in 10 other colors. You can only see a little bit of the top of her pants in the scene where she wear this outfit so I imagined that she might wear these wide leg sweater pants on her way to work. They’s also be perfect for working from home and are available in black and grey. These grey flannel essential sneakers sold out when I posted them before but they have more sizes in stock now. They are the perfect comfortable shoe for fall. We never see Jennifer Aniston’s bag with this outfit and before, I suggested she’d carry a leather tote bag to work. Now that everyone is working from home, I’d suggest wearing this saddle leather shoulder bag for running errands or walking the dog. These Blue Light Blocking Glasses come in many different unisex styles for only $17.99. This is the outfit that Alex Levy wear for a secret outing in the rain. Of course, Alex wears a Burberry Trench Coat which is a classic style you’ll have forever but the Icon Trench is a less expensive option. Even casual, Alex levy dresses chic so it’s no wonder she wears a black cashmere sweater and matching black jogger pants. If a cashmere set is too expensive right now, I also like this grey waffle pullover with matching waffle jogger pants. The set is sold separately and is available in three other colors. You could also wear the waffle jogger pants with a regular sweatshirt or cashmere sweater for Zoom calls. You don’t see what shoes Alex Levy wears so I’d suggest these black Essential Sneakers. These are two more on air outfits that are great work from home inspiration. It also looks like everything in her on air closet can be mixed and matched to make more options since it’s almost all shades of camel, gray, navy, and black. “We worked with colors that we wouldn’t normally do with Jen: peanut and camel. We wanted most of her wardrobe to be monochromatic so that you didn’t have any lines breaking up her body, so that as a newscaster, there were no distractions. Instead of putting her in suits, we did trousers and sport coats. We wanted her to be sophisticated, but we also wanted her to be accessible and culturally appropriate.” Alex Levy wears a black tie neck blouse but this gold silk-satin jacquard blouse would be a better color for Zoom meetings. These stretch-wool flared pants are a workhorse that could be paired with anything in your closet. You can never go wrong with a grey cashmere sweater. I’d add a gold-plated cable necklace for Zoom calls. These Italian stretch wool trousers are another great work pant. I bought these last year and had my tailor add belt loops. Alex Levy wears black suede pumps but if you are working from home, I would suggest wearing these sherpa slippers instead. The all grey outfit is the one that I already have in my closet. I love grey in the winter because it’s so much less harsh than all black. Jen and I have the same color hair so it’s a good color for both of us too. I’ve never met a grey coat I didn’t like and this charcoal double-faced wool coat is calling my name. This other charcoal double-faced wool top coat is very similar and much less expensive. I like this luxurious grey cashmere sweater but the Naadam cashmere sweater is only $75 if you’re looking for a deal.  These slim Italian stretch wool cropped pants would look great with heels, flats, and sneakers. This fringed cashmere scarf looks very similar to the one on the show and is very needed with the cold weather now. This cashmere scarf is similar but cheaper too. Jennifer Aniston’s character wears some sort of loafer that I couldn’t see so I’d pair her grey outfit with these canvas slip-on sneakers but a more realistic option are these New Balance sneakers. Jennifer Aniston’s character carries the Valextra Brera Leather Top Handle Bag with this outfit but this Valextra canvas and leather tote bag is a expensive option. A much cheaper option is this navy carryall tote. The stylist for Jennifer Aniston on The Morning Show had a deal with Chopard to supply the watches. For the next season, I could see Alex Levy wearing the Hermès Apple Watch. Because the Alex Levy character wears so many classic neutral pieces, it’s easy to mix and match everything in her wardrobe. The classic black pants can be paired with any blouse or sweater. Here are a few extras I’d add into your closet. “Alex Levy lives in New York. She lives in an expensive apartment. She’s one of the top network journalists. She’s esteemed and probably the most intelligent person in the room. We wanted her clothes to look strong and precise. So, the tailoring alterations, the length of her shoe the length of her pants, the fit of her trouser. She was impeccably dressed. She was believable as someone at the top of her field.” I strangely don’t own a plain black coat but I think this Weekend Max Mara Coat would be a classic style I’d have for years to come and looks similar to the one Jen wears on the show. Adding in different colored scarves can also change up your look in the winter. This is the camel version of the grey fringed cashmere scarf from an earlier outfit. Everyone needs a parka in the winter too but I hate all the black puffer coats. Jennifer wears a similar version to this Water Resistant Long Parka with Faux Fur Trim which comes in three colors and is on sale right now. If you want to splurge on one thing, Jennifer wears this exact Loro Piano Shell Jacket for a remote newscast in California. A less expensive option is the navy Perfect Rain Jacket which is 40% off plus additional 10% off with the code 25HOURS. It looks like Jen’s character could be wearing the black and white striped Saint Laurent Cashmere Sweater but this navy and white striped Classic Sweater is a cheaper alternative. Sleep and sleepwear play a large part of The Morning Show since the anchors have to get up at 3:30am so they are ready for the show to start at 7:00am. She wakes up to a view of the city which no morning anchor would ever do. She would have had electric black-out shade or worn an eye mask like this navy silk eye mask. She also uses eye patches and a jade face roller in the morning to deff puff and worries if she really has “passed her sell by date” for television. The navy silk Eres pajamas she wears in one episode are sold out but this navy long-sleeve cotton pajama set is a less expensive option. I actually bought these pajamas for a trip this weekend because I have to share a hotel room with a friend. In another episode she wears a matching lounge set of a robe and jogger pants. This Naked Cashmere Robe is very similar as are this pullover and joggers. I think filming of season two of The Morning Show has been a little delayed due to the pandemic. I look forward to seeing how Jennifer Aniston’s character Alex Levy’s wardrobe evolves when the season finally airs.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and ‘Morning Show’ Cast Unpack Season 2 Finale', 'content': '  For the second season in a row, the Apple TV+ drama ends with a broadcast where \"there’s no filter and there’s just the truth,\" Aniston tells The Hollywood Reporter. BY JACKIE STRAUSE  [This story contains spoilers to the second season finale of Apple’s The Morning Show, “Fever.”] Jennifer Aniston has been put through the wringer playing Alex Levy on The Morning Show.  After rocking her world as she knew it by exposing her longtime, beloved co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) as a sexual predator, the Apple TV+ drama set Alex on a two-season, rollercoaster journey of self-reflection. She publicly exposed her own #MeToo-era complicity, attempted to take down and reshape a network, went through a divorce, retired; then she made a comeback, was lauded as a feminist hero, faced being “canceled” over her relationship to Mitch, suffered a near-breakdown, grieved the death of Mitch, made amends — and then, in the finale, she tested positive for COVID-19.   “It was relentless! Honestly, I did think at one point the writers were trying to kill me!” Jennifer Aniston joked to The Hollywood Reporter about the whiplash from the cascading hits that kept coming at Alex. (The star summed up the emotions with seven different emojis on Instagram.) “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. You guys! Literally crawling to the finish line here.\\'”  Alex suffered severe symptoms after picking up COVID-19 from her trip to Italy to see Mitch. And to hear showrunner Kerry Ehrin tell it, the fever that Alex experienced was symbolic of the entire Morning Show journey. “The fever to me was almost representative as a fire that burned her, and she rises out of it like a phoenix with a better sense of her true self and the person she wants to be,” Ehrin told THR about Alex’s season-ending broadcast of The Morning Show, streamed from her living room, where she encouraged others to take a hard look in the mirror while shedding light on her own process of doing just that. For the second season in a row, The Morning Show cut to black after a broadcast, this time with Alex’s parting words to “stay safe and stay sane.” The abrupt ending leaves lingering questions as to where the morning news drama could go next, especially while it awaits a season three renewal. Elsewhere in the episode, COVID is rapidly spreading through New York City as the country unknowingly sits on the cusp of lockdown, back in March of 2020; Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) has just confessed his love for Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), whose girlfriend Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies) is in Montana to wait out the virus; and the Morning Show crew is planning to set up remotely to ready for work amid the looming pandemic.   Below, Ehrin, Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Margulies, Billy Crudup and Greta Lee — who all spoke to THR at the start of the season — weigh in on the season two ending while sharing their thoughts about where things could go next. Alex Emerging After COVID Mitch’s death brought about a marked shift in Alex when the struggling anchor began to accept her flaws and hold herself accountable. “I think that moment when she learns of the news, the bottom drops out and that’s it,” explains Aniston. “She realizes, ‘I don’t want the [Morning Show] deal. I don’t want to be this.’ She sort of goes to all the ghosts of the past to make amends and is almost tying up loose ends in order to say, ‘I can’t. That’s it. That’s a wrap.\\'” But it wasn’t until she came down with serious symptoms of COVID-19 that she reached acceptance. “It’s a portrayal of what happens to a person being that broken down and that kind of surrendered because your body is so sick, where there’s no filter and there’s just the truth,” says Aniston of Alex’s unabashedly honest finale broadcast. “She’s hit: Fuck it. And doesn’t give a shit what anybody thinks anymore. She’s spent the whole season trying to plug up all the holes in the canoe so she could not be found out, this desperation. But now she’s saying, unapologetically: This is who I am, this is what I am.”   Executive producer Mimi Leder, who directed the finale among other season two episodes, describes the final scene as a tidal wave hitting Alex. “Alex goes on a very important journey where she questions: Is she still relevant? She was so fearful of Maggie’s book, like it’s really going to hurt her existence. She was a very fearful person at the start of the season and she really goes on a journey of self-discovery and of enormous change and really looks in that mirror,” she says. “For the end sequence, we wanted it to feel more like a prayer than a pronouncement. That it was Alex saying: This is what I hope for, this is what I wish for; this is what I want it to be. We really wanted it to be singular with her, alone, in some way having it be raw, naked and exposed. To be like a prayer.” Aniston, who also executive produces the Apple TV+ drama, doesn’t know if Alex’s onscreen experience with COVID will hold a larger impact on the audience, but she’s hopeful. “I think people still are not understanding the beast that [COVID] is,” she says. “I think people are living in an ignorance-is-bliss kind of world because it’s almost too much to really take a look at it. If you really did, people would have hopefully gotten their act together and listened to the science and understood that, if you want an end to this, there is a means to it.” As for how Alex will emerge, Ehrin previously told THR: “A part of the character of Alex that I always imagined is that she had a public self and she had a private self, and they were very much apart. Her whole arc is about getting those two pieces together to create a whole that is authentic.” Bradley’s Love Triangle With Cory and Laura After embarking on a season-long romance with Laura, Bradley finds herself once again leaning on Cory for help as she searches for her missing brother, who struggles with addiction. Laura had escaped to Montana amid the looming coronavirus, but the pair had solidified their relationship before they parted. When Cory confesses to Bradley that he loves her, Bradley is too preoccupied with finding her brother to give him a proper reaction, leaving the confession hanging in the COVID-swirling air.   “I’m really interested in their love triangle between Laura and Cory, the complexity of the chemistry she has with Cory,” says Witherspoon. “But, again, it’s a person she works with, so I’m really curious how it all plays out.” Overall, the star and executive producer says her hopes for Bradley are broader: That she’s not so hard on herself. “I think we’re all hard on ourselves and she’s a character who comes from a pretty complicated past that she still hasn’t really reconciled,” she adds. “Her relationship with her brother is really complex and I’m really interested in what the next step would be with her and her brother, because it’s such a big piece of her life. Your siblings can really define you, and either help you or torpedo you.” On the opposite end is Laura, a woman Margulies has described as “so comfortable and calm, that you want Bradley to find refuge.” Having previously summed up their connection as a “safe-haven relationship,” Margulies says she wants to return and see how Laura and Bradley will fare, if that’s in the cards for the show: “I don’t know where it’s going to go, but I really love their relationship and I think that even the little bit that you saw will change Bradley, whether or not Bradley is with her or not.”   Crudup also remains unaware of what Cory’s declaration will bring. One thing he and Bradley have in common, he says, is their impulsiveness. “It was such a shocking moment for Cory to realize that [he loves Bradley],” says Crudup. “When he says it to Bradley, I think it’s truly a discovery. Whether it happened to him just in that moment or the day before, it wasn’t something that he’s been sitting on for four months [the timeline of seasons one and two].” He continues, “He’s been a caretaker in a way. What he was really concerned about was the well-being of this precious person to him and being able to articulate that that was also him being in love with her, it would have been impossible until that moment.” Indeed, it was a bumpy road to get to this point, after Cory betrayed Bradley by exposing her relationship with Laura in the press — something Bradley remains in the dark about. “I don’t think that was the motivation for him trying to undermine her relationship with Laura,” Crudup says about Cory’s feelings, “but I [also] don’t know what kind of potential there is in the future [with Cory and Bradley].” The Future of UBA (and UBA+) The first season of The Morning Show tracked the ascension of rising executive Cory. But, as Ehrin has noted, everything looks different from the view at the top. The second season ends with the UBA CEO nervously taking stock of his NYC surroundings on the brink of the COVID outbreak and on the precipice of his industry, as well as every other industry, facing a survival need to adapt. Amid all of that, coupled with a failure to launch streamer UBA+, how will Cory push ahead professionally? “I’ve been playing him as a ruthless gamer for a couple years, so I would be disappointed if we didn’t keep that up,” says Crudup. “One thing about that kind of person is, they’re willing to get in those hostile environments because they’re willing to take a punch. And he better get knocked on his ass so that they can maybe reveal the depths of his actual strength.”   Meanwhile his mentee, UBA president Stella Bak (Greta Lee), also finds herself faced with figuring out how to lead amid unforeseen challenges. “There’s an endless amount of drama because this is a workplace drama, that’s the magic of this,” Lee has said about her hopes to return “as a boss, yes.” She added, “It feels like an athletic event being on this show, what’s required of you in terms of pace and stamina. And it’s been a real joy to be able to step up and play ball with these guys.” Their Hopes for a Season 3 Despite waiting on a season three renewal, Ehrin said she did not approach the ending to season two as a series finale. “You can’t write every year as a possible series finale and have them have any value after a certain point. We wanted to write about the time, those three months, and the characters in that time and how they all wound up. So, no I don’t think it’s written as an end to the series at all,” she said.   If the show returns for season three, Ehrin also said she has no interest in picking up right where they left off. “I think it’s going to have been done, done, done. So, it wouldn’t be my instinct,” she said of capturing the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, she acknowledged that the possibilities are endless: “You could [jump into the future]. You could go backwards. It’s such an interesting little universe. You really can put it anywhere in time, and I think the challenge of the show is coming up with that big subject.” The idea that the first two seasons could serve as bookends to two major moments in recent history (#MeToo and the pandemic), also appeals to Aniston, who says she is still sitting with season two. “It’s so hard to even imagine it right now,” she says when asked about doing more, comparing the release of the season to birthing a baby. “You know when they say mothers almost have a block: ‘I could never do that again!’ I’m a little bit in that moment of, ‘I don’t know if I could ever do that again!’ So, we’ll see.” What would she like to happen to Alex next? “Oh, just a lot of love and fun and dancing and playing and something with a lot more levity!” Witherspoon, who says they are “talking about” and “definitely planning a season three,” also imagines a post-COVID future for The Morning Show. “If #MeToo was the center of season one and season two has so many issues but really tackles the impending pandemic, I would love to see how the world realigns post-quarantine,” she says. “Even though that seems optimistic to say at this point, with people still dealing with the complexity of COVID and really what it’s doing to different industries. But just, how the whole world has culturally shifted in so many ways; the way we communicate and work, the way we talk to each other — there’s definitely a lot to talk about and tackle.” The Status of a Season 3 The Morning Show team is waiting on a renewal from Apple. “We haven’t had an official pickup for a third season. We’re waiting on that,” said Ehrin, who has an overall development deal with the streamer. When asked if she envisions one or more seasons, or plans to take a beat before returning to The Morning Show‘s writers room, Ehrin replied: “That’s a huge question. I feel like the show has a lot of different projections that would work for it. I think right now, I just finished a season that has taken two years. I am just taking a break! (Laughs.) I do have a development deal [at Apple] and I am working on some other projects that I’m excited about. And, that being said, I love the show and I dearly love the cast of the show and I hope it continues.” Should the Morning Show continue, viewers can gleam what they like about how Ehrin summed up the first two seasons, and whether or not they escaped the “wreckage” of trying to dismantle and change — amid a looming pandemic: “They didn’t realize there was another mountain that was going to fall on them! I think probably that’s just the story of life. There’s always another mountain that’s going to fall on you. The struggle continues.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Inside the business of TV with breaking news, expert analysis and showrunner interviews Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The Morning Show Season 3 Is Must-See TV After Two Year Hiatus', 'content': 'Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are back in the newsroom with some new guests joining them. THE BEST PART of waking up (at least, in this alternate TV show reality) is cancel culture diatribes and failing news networks on Apple TV+\\'s The Morning Show. After a two-year hiatus and a second season defined by COVID, one of Apple\\'s earliest flagship shows returns with a third season looking to cut through the noise of a crowded fall TV market with good old-fashioned newsroom drama. Season 2 ended the way the Covid-19 pandemic started in March 2020: shrouded in uncertainty and panic. UBA\\'s The Morning Show host Alexandra \"Alex\" Levy (Jennifer Aniston) closed a broadcast imploring the viewing public to “stay safe and stay sane\" as Covid-19 begins blanketing the country. She also struggled with Covid-19 symptoms throughout the entire finale. Covid was only her latest battle, as Alex became the most hated person on TV after footage leaked of her speaking positively about her disgraced former on-air co-host Mitch Kessler (Steve Carrell) at his memorial, and also admitting to visiting him in Italy, a potential Covid hot zone. Mitch was fired and canceled in Season 1 for sexually assaulting UBA talent booker Hannah Shoenfeld (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). She’s entering Season 3 as a woman who no longer apologizes for who she is or the mistakes she\\'s made. But she isn’t the only one no longer running from shame. Her protective co-host Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) eschews her shame over her missing brother Hal Jackson (Joe Tippett), who is struggling with alcohol addiction, by publicly asking people to help her find him. Season 2 was a reckoning for Bradley, who began accepting her past actions, such as revealing her teenage abortion on air and Hal absolving her of guilt over causing his alcoholism. After reconciling with her brother, Bradley is ready to enter a new era at UBA and The Morning Show with new issues and characters on the horizon. The Morning Show world has some new guests. Jon Hamm plays UBA executive Paul Marks, who the trailer conveniently shows as UBA\\'s President of the News Division Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) says they need someone with \"more money than God.\" Ellison, whose launch event of the UBA+ streaming service was curtailed by Covid in Season 2, stresses in the trailer the network is \"flirting with financial disaster. That may be why Marks seemingly offers him a lifeline, meaning Hamm will play a crucial role in the future of The Morning Show. There will also be a new news anchor—Christina Hunter (Nicole Beharie)—who is strutting around in the trailer like she already owns the place. There are enough new faces and problems for The Morning Show to justify the two-year hiatus. But now it\\'s back. Episodes of The Morning Show air on Apple TV+ every Wednesday at 12:01 A.M. Et/9:01 P.M. ET. The next episode will be released on November 8. This season of The Morning Show will have its typical 10-episode slate. That means there is one episode left in The Morning Show Season 3.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '‘The Morning Show’ Is Gaslighting Viewers Into Liking Alex Levy, and I’ve Had It', 'content': ' I am not on the Alex Levy train. That isn’t to say that I’m not devouring Apple’s utterly unhinged and bafflingly self-absorbed “The Morning Show,” which returned for its third season on September 13, but once again this show expects viewers to accept without question that Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) is America’s sweetheart — a once-in-a-generation talent and personality, and the axis upon which this show’s world turns. Like I said, I’m not buying it. This is not about Aniston. In fact, I’m pretty sure Aniston is the only reason “The Morning Show” viewers are being force fed the Alex Levy agenda season-after-season. Aniston very much is an American sweetheart (as is her costar Reese Witherspoon), beloved for her decade as Rachel Green on “Friends,” a successful movie career, and those Aveeno ads (winter is coming, y’all). Aniston and Steve Carell’s return to television was a major hook for “The Morning Show” Season 1, which reportedly got five times the viewership of the average Apple show when it premiered, whatever that means (Season 3 is currently in high demand).  In Season 1, Alex’s popularity makes sense as a foregone conclusion. “The Morning Show” opens in a world about to be rocked by allegations against her cohost Mitch (Steve Carell), a world in which these two are a staple of the American talk show landscape. Alex is also a victim — of Mitch’s lies and the network’s manipulation, if nothing else — and garners sympathy as the smiling, stalwart news anchor — the public face of how everyone at UBA is coping with crisis. But things change in Season 2. Alex quit after calling out Mitch’s behavior in the Season 1 finale, ostensibly leaving Bradley (Witherspoon) adrift and unpartnered on-the-air. Why “The Morning Show” opted not to show these critical character moments remains a mystery (not really — the show practically tripped over itself to fast forward to 2020 and tackle COVID with all the nuance and sensitivity of salt water on a paper cut), and it ends up being woven into expository dialogue, along with the idea that Alex must come back and nothing is the same without her. Viewers don’t see any of that; Aniston is still a fixture of the show in Season 2, and Alex agrees to rejoin “TMS” by the first episode. Whatever X factor the network was missing without her isn’t even slightly conveyed on-screen.  “I need you. UBA needs you,” Cory (Billy Crudup) says, while groveling for her to come back. “You were all we ever needed and we were too stupid to see it.” This is so intense, not least because it’s a former boss approaching an employee (If my boss did that? I’d get the ick!), but also because WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT??? Other than tenure, the Alex Levy presented to viewers in Season 1 is not remotely capable in ways that her fellow anchors are not. Bradley requires some talk show finishing school, but she arrives in Season 2 with blonde hair and a willingness to debase herself by performing musical numbers on the air — the hallmark of any great morning show anchor! Why on Earth would she need Alex back in order to pursue her own goals, which is the explanation Cory provides? (He also leaves Alex a voicemail quoting poetry. Ick.) Other anchors Eric (Hasan Minhaj), Alison (Janina Gavankar), Daniel (Desean Terry) and Yanko (Nestor Carbonell) are all smart, well-spoken, and attractive, but they are not Alex. Also, all of them and every character besides Cory seems fully aware of Alex’s less desirable traits in Season 2, but instead of unpacking their justified assessments of her, this only serves to fuel Alex’s self-righteous tirade (more on that later). In Episode 203, Alex explicitly tells Bradley that she’s “lost touch” and is trying to do better. Big if true! Perhaps a major wrench in the Alex Levy train’s gears is that viewers rarely get to see “The Morning Show” — that is, the show-within-the-show — from the perspective of its in-world audience. We see Alex, Bradley, and their colleagues on set or monitors, through the perspective of producers and editors, but almost never through the eyes of the American people into whose homes they broadcast every day. “The Other Two” did this in just one half-hour episode, Season 2’s “Pat Connects With Her Fans,” where Molly Shannon’s character starts interacting with fans after a taping. Alex Levy, as depicted, would rather have a root canal than speak to a normal person. She socializes exclusively with the famous and wealthy (and white), lives in an ultra-luxurious Manhattan penthouse. Ah yes, the penthouse, also known as her quarantine zone — just thousands of square footage of marble and glass and granite from which she broadcast a live feed spitting on her audience for canceling her (they hadn’t) and suggesting she’d rather die of COVID. None of this behavior is out-of-step with what an A-list celebrity could or would do, but “The Morning Show” doesn’t show us the charm behind the sting, the qualities that make Alex’s fans love her anyway, separating the proverbial art and artist.  Credit where credit is due; the narrative arc of America’s sweetheart torpedoing her own charisma and career via cancel culture and global pandemic is actually a scintillating storytelling prospect — alas, “The Morning Show” is nowhere near capable of executing that. Season 3 returns to sanctifying her largely via Cory, who is directly asked, “What is this Alex Levy magic? Can you explain this to me?” by Jon Hamm’s Paul Marks because crucially, Paul doesn’t see it. Cory says she’s a “survivor,” and that “that’s what people want to see right now.” He lists all her trials, including the coronavirus, which has been experienced by almost 800 million people globally — but yeah, Alex Levy live streaming from her penthouse is “the one human that people can actually relate to.” These comments (including “Alex Levy is Lazarus”) feel like outright lies, especially after that Season 2 finale. Maybe if a show has to keep writing out what makes its main character (or star anchor) so exceptional, they don’t come across that way — and maybe aren’t! Alex Levy claims to be “unprecedented,” and that much is true in terms of how much Cory and UBA and “The Morning Show” itself love her despite everything. I only wish we could say the same.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The best Apple+ TV series and movies to stream right now', 'content': \"   All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Lucy Ford So, you're now committed to Apple TV+, making it your umpteenth streaming service. But what to actually watch? Since it emerged as the latest gladiator in the ring of streaming services, Apple TV+ has been populating its catalogue with a seemingly endless roster (and budget!) of prestige shows and films, all the while roping in big names like Tom Hanks, Jennifer Aniston and Leonardo DiCaprio. Having only launched less than five years ago, the streamer already has a handful of Oscar nominations and wins under its belt (including 2021's Coda and Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon) as well as award-winning shows like Severance and The Morning Show. It even finally managed to make football (sorry, soccer) break big in the States thanks to the perma-positive Ted Lasso. Huge! But with now so many options on the streamer to dive into, it can feel overwhelming. So we've taken it upon ourselves to whittle down the best of the best of the bunch. Here’s the GQ edit of the films and TV shows to watch on Apple TV+. Have you ever wished you could fully switch off once the working day is done? That's the idea of Severance, created by none other than Ben Stiller. The series is led by Adam Scott and imagines a world where you completely turn off any knowledge or memory of work once you're done with it. Sounds ideal, right? But as the series goes on, everyone is forced to come to terms with what exactly their work-life balance is costing. It doesn't feel hyperbolic to say that, right now, Severance is probably one of the best things on Apple TV+ right now, and with season 2 currently in production, we hopefully won't have to wait too much longer for more. You can watch Severance on Apple TV+. Killers of the Flower Moon is one of Apple TV+'s shining jewels. A three-and-a-half-hour Martin Scorsese epic about a dark stain on America's history revolving around the slow annihilation of an Osage Native community starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Lily Gladstone? We're sure the champagne popped when they secured that deal. Based on a true story about a series of Native murders in Oklahoma, the film faces head-on the injustice of when systemic oppression is committed by those closest to you. There's an abject cruelty at the heart of the film that Scorsese begs you to not look away from. Unsurprisingly, it's a big nom at this year's Oscars, including the stellar performance from Gladstone. You can watch Killers of the Flower Moon on Apple TV+. Constellation is a sci-fi spin on a classic space exploration story – an astronaut lands back on Earth only to realise that things just don't feel right. In prior space movies or series, it's been emotional, like a part of them is still up in the cosmos, or physical like their legs just don't work on hard land now. In Constellation, starring Noomi Rapace as Jo, it's something altogether more mystical as she returns to discover that key parts of her life are missing. It's part horror, part psychological thriller, part twisty, loopy mind puzzle. You can watch Constellation on Apple TV+. If you recently saw The Iron Claw and thought to yourself ‘Wow, Zac Efron is actually really good isn’t he?', then perhaps it's time to dip back into his back catalogue, because it's full of charming if not downright brilliant performances. The Greatest Beer Run Ever, co-starring Russell Crowe and written and directed by Green Book's Peter Farrelly, isn't a particularly great movie, but Efron brings some of that classic tortured buffoon energy he's honed since the likes of Bad Neighbours and Hairspray. It follows Efron's Chickie Donohue who heads into the throws of Vietnam to grab a couple of beers with his old army pals, only to realise that great fight for freedom is more horrifying and oppressing than he could have imagined. You can watch The Greatest Beer Run Ever on Apple TV+. More than 20 years ago, Steven Spielberg rounded up a crew of buzzy, up-and-coming lads to make up his Band of Brothers. Since then, the likes of Tom Hardy, Damian Lewis and Michael Fassbender have gone on to be leading men. In 2024, he's replicated the formula with Masters of the Air, a similar sweeping wartime-based epic series about fighter pilots starring men of the moment Austin Butler, Barry Keoghan and Ncuti Gatwa, as well as soon-to-be superstars Callum Turner and Anthony Boyle. Masters of the Air is the kind of show you'll like if you like war things – planes in the air, sick aviator jackets, rousing platitudes about honour and freedom. If that's your bag, it's never looked as slick on the small screen as right now. You can watch Masters of the Air on Apple TV+. There's something delightfully nostalgic about a good old-fashioned plane-hijacking story where a supremely qualified negotiator just happens to be on board. Idris Elba re-enters the silly action genre with Hijack, a show about, well, a plane getting hijacked. It's laying all of its cards on the table, ok? The tried-and-tested formula works just as well on the small screen, especially as the show loops in on the people on the ground trying to make sense of an emergency 40,000ft in the air. Luckily for us, it's also just been renewed for a second season, so let's hope Elba isn't the unluckiest traveller alive that time around. You can watch Hijack on Apple TV+. Is Argylle a great movie? Debatable. Is it the most outlandish display of the bucks combined with Matthew Vaughn's maximalist vision? Absolutely. After delving into the world of spies with his Kingsman franchise, Argylle puts Vaughn back in familiar territory with a fictional super spy named Argylle (Henry Cavill) and the novel writer who pens him (Bryce Dallas Howard). As it's Vaughn, expect insane set pieces and stunts that are almost uncanny valley in their CGI execution, as well as multiple twists and turns you'll only slightly see coming. You can watch Argylle on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung CODA was the little indie film that could! After winning a bidding war that saw Apple TV+ a record $25m for its distribution, it went on to win the big prize at the 2022 Oscars as well as a Best Actor nod for the superb Troy Kotsur. The movie was a landmark moment for stories about the hearing-impaired, with a cast of mostly deaf actors. The intimate family story follows 17-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones), the only hearing member of a deaf family who finds solace from her family's hard fishing work in singing and music. Definitely worth a watch. You can watch CODA on Apple TV+. Like so many Apple TV+ shows, Shining Girls, for some reason, went largely overlooked when it was released in 2022. It seems the streamer just has so many prestige hits with big stars it doesn't know how best to get them out there. So if you missed Elizabeth Moss's crime thriller, time to rectify that, because it's worth your time. After stunning turns in both seasons of Top of the Lake, Moss brings that dark and tortured energy here to a story about a journalist who, after being attacked and left for dead in her past, starts to look into a murder she thinks might have been committed by the same assailant. You can watch Shining Girls on Apple TV+. Guns! Horses! Big silly hats! Ridley Scott's Napoleon, fronted by Joaquin Phoenix, is everything you want (and expect) a Scott take on one of history's biggest blowhards to be. It's your standard biopic, chronicling the tiddly general's origins and then swift rise to the ranks as a ruthless and brutal emperor. It also paints a portrait of his volatile relationship with his wife Josephine, played by Vanessa Kirby. You know what you're getting with Ridley Scott's Napoleon, which is a loose respect for historical accuracy but a big emphasis on things going boom! You can watch Napoleon on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung We may no longer live in the golden age of the rom-com, but luckily, there are still plenty of small-screen (and a few big-screen, to be fair) offerings that scratch their itch. One of them is the sincere-but-funny Trying, starring Rafe Spall and Esther Smith, which is the kind of show made to keep us going on a Sunday night when all we want is to watch two bumbling people eventually admit they quite fancy each other. More Richard Curtis than, say, a dark comedy like Motherland, Trying’s story of a London couple deciding to adopt is funny enough and sweet enough to hit whatever emotional beats you might need after your weekend takeaway. You can watch Trying on Apple TV+. One of Apple TV+'s first big sci-fi pushes comes in the form of Foundation, a galaxy-spanning story of humans scattered across the universe under the rule of a galactic empire based on a series of books by Isaac Asimov. Think Star Trek, but with the big bucks behind it. With two seasons under its belt, the show seems to just be getting better and better, which is why it's a good thing a third season has already been greenlit. Foundation stars Lee Pace, who is always a joy to see towering over the screen, as well as Jared Harris and Lou Llobell. You can watch Foundation on Apple TV+. Criminal Record is the gritty, British crime drama that you should be watching right now. It stars Peter Capaldi as an embittered police detective who's seemingly getting angrier by the day by the taxing horrors of his job. That's not helped when he's informed by a younger upstart cop that a previous murder suspect he investigated – who's now sitting in prison – may have actually been wrongfully convicted. Evidence mounts that they got the wrong man and that a murderer is still out of the street, and Capaldi's Daniel has to learn to let his pride fall by the wayside to get justice. You can watch Criminal Record on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung Currently gearing up for its second season, now is the perfect time to jump into the fantastic Bad Sisters if it passed you by the first time. Sharon Horgan and Anne-Marie Duff star in the show which follows five sisters who find themselves at the heart of a life insurance investigation after one of their abusive husbands turns up dead. Think Big Little Lies, but set in Ireland rather than Monteray. It's also rip-roaringly funny in a dark, twisted way. You can watch Bad Sisters on Apple TV+. Bad Neighbours solidified Seth Rogan and Rose Byrn as an underrated comedic duo, and one that should probably be legally required to star in something together at regular intervals. They can be like the stoned version of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Thankfully, Platonic brings them back together again, not as a married couple fighting off frat boys this time but as a pair of former college besties who rekindle their friendship later in their middle age with all of the weird curveballs and responsibilities that have come with it. Naturally, re-sparking that chemistry ends up throwing their worlds into shambles. You can watch Platonic on Apple TV+. Like so much of its catalogue, Silo might just be one of Apple TV+'s best-kept secrets. Rebecca Ferguson (again, one of our most underrated stars) leads this high-concept dystopian series about the last ten thousand people on Earth who are protected from the toxic and deadly world above them by living in a mile-deep hole in the ground. But, mysteries abound about how and who created the silo they shelter in, and anyone who dares try to find out meets a grizzly end. You can watch Silo on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung It turns out that the one man who has the power to bring Harrison Ford to the small screen is none other than Ted Lasso's Brett Goldstein. Ford has firmly entered the ‘delighted by lots of things’ era no one expected the affectionate grumpus to get to. With Shrinking, he plays a fellow therapist alongside Jason Segal's lead who, after losing his wife, approaches his vocation with extreme and brutal honesty. Sure, the show treads that very cliche narrative of ‘man whose arc revolves around a dead wife', but when you've got Ford being a lil silly it's hard to pay that too much mind. You can watch Shrinking on Apple TV+. The Morning Show is the most expensive soap opera you'll ever invest in. No, seriously. Set against the backdrop of a US national morning news show and its parent station, the series, starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, has covered world events like the January 6th insurrection and the battle of Roe vs Wade with all the dramatic flair of someone learning that they've had an evil twin this whole time! You honestly have to appreciate how seriously everyone on this show takes it, as it makes the viewing of it so much more fun. You might think it's dumb, but we bet you get sucked into a multi-hour binge regardless. You can watch The Morning Show on Apple TV+. Michael J. Fox's story is undeniably tragic – a once-beloved and iconic pop culture figure struck down in his prime with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. But Fox has always railed against a sympathetic gaze or a ‘Isn’t that just so sad' narrative and put himself forward as a fighter, someone you shouldn't push into the chapters of Hollywood tragedy. Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie is an intimate look into the life of Fox now, with his anchoring marriage and family, peppered with archival footage of his youth on and off screen. You can watch Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung On the face of it, Min Jin Lee's generation-spanning book about a Korean family trying to survive through Japanese occupation, poverty and crippling societal pressures feels like it should be unadaptable to the screen. Its anchoring character, played, in older age, by Minari Oscar-winner Youn Yuh-jung, provides a throughline to the story that both offers an expansive look at the personal ramifications of geopolitics and the intimate bonds and loyalties forged through tragedy. The narrative follows through the Second World War and into the '80s society as four generations reckon with racism, discrimination, identity and prosperity. Season 2 will be on its way this year. You can watch Pachinko on Apple TV+. We should let Taron Egerton be in more things! The modern day song and dance man jumps into this true story of a policeman's son who, after being locked up in a minimum security prison for 10 years, is given a choice to either wait his days out with no parole or enter a maximum security prison for the criminally insane to befriend a serial killer and coax info out of him about the bodies of missing women. Like so many prison stories, Black Bird is an exercise in building tension, which is heightened by its co-lead Paul Walter Hauser who plays a chilling serial killing rapist with an abundance of menace and threat. You can watch Black Bird on Apple TV+. Lisey’s Story is an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel of the same name, written for screen by the author himself – we told you, Apple TV secures the big names! The eight-part series focuses on Lisey, played by Julianne Moore (mother!), a widow who, two years after her husband’s murder, is forced to confront elements of her marriage that she had purposefully forgotten. King and Moore aren't the only names worth noting for this one, though, as it's executive-produced by JJ Abrams. It is an intense, intriguing and aesthetically beautiful watch. You can watch Lisey's Story on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung An eight-part series executive-produced by Asif Kapadia and James Gay-Rees, the team behind the Oscar-winning Amy, looks at the role of music in 1971. It's primarily set against the background of the Vietnam War as protest rages in the US, which provided fertile ground for some of our most enduring classics. From Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On” and John Lennon’s “Imagine” to George Harrison and Ravi Shankar’s Concert For Bangladesh, it relies solely on archive footage, audio interviews and voiceover and provides a thorough look at one of the most politically charged eras in recent history. You can watch 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything on Apple TV+. Ted Lasso did the unthinkable. No, not make SNL alum Jason Sudeikis Hollywood's ultimate leading man, but made football a hit over the other side of the pond. A fish-out-of-water story with a sports-oriented twist, Ted Lasso sees Sudeikis step into the titular character's shoes, as an American football coach landing in London to take on a slumping Premier League team. It's a comedy, which means you'll have to sit through a lot of British jokes written by Americans that don't necessarily land, but if you're after an easy, feel-good watch this is your best bet. The best part? Even those who don't have the slightest clue about football will enjoy it. You can watch Ted Lasso on Apple TV+. There's no one like The Boss and Bruce Springsteen fans can rejoice because, on top of his latest album, Letter To You, he teamed up with Apple TV+ to make a documentary of the same name, following his journey creating the record with the full E Street Band. Like many behind-the-record films, this one is a heady mix of intimate elements of the recording process as well as a showcase of some of the songs, as there are final take performances of the tracks peppered throughout. Even if you don't count yourself as a Springsteen fan, you'll finish this doc in awe of his stamina and perseverance (and of how he still looks like that!). You can watch Bruce Springsteen's Letter To You on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung Dickinson's three-season run on Apple TV+ might have been the best thing they had going for a while that, sadly, many didn't tune in for. Sure, on the face of it, a biographical series about one of history's most secluded and isolated literary figures doesn't exactly sound like a riveting watch, but the comedy-drama injects so much life into Dickinson's story that it feels like an apology for how we often look at childless and unwedded women of the past. Starring Hailee Steinfeld, the quirky series explores Dickinson's gender and sexual identity, as well as the thoughtful and private connections she carried through her life. You can watch Dickinson on Apple TV+. There's a running joke that Apple TV+ has a penchant for shows about sad astronauts in space. That's not not true, but For All Mankind is still worth your time. It builds on a compelling premise, which is ‘What if this big historical moment had gone differently? What would our world look like?’. In it, that history shift comes in the form of the space race and what would have happened if Russia had beaten the US to the moon and ushered in a global Leninist way of life. It's a fun and often tension-filled series that presents an alternate reality to our own that, despite changing the course of history, proves human nature is a steady throughline. You can watch For All Mankind on Apple TV+. Directed by Spike Jonze, Beastie Boys Story sees the group’s two surviving members, Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond, discussing their rise to fame in front of a live audience, which is an interesting spin on the usual structure of these kinds of retrospectives. While a lot of these films are exercises in letting artists give themselves a pat on the back, this one doesn't shy away from some of the stickier parts of the Beastie Boys story. They are honest about their treatment of Kate Schellenbach, a founding member who was forced out of the band, and about their relationship with Russell Simmons and Rick Ruben. But grief over the death of bandmate Adam Yauch (AKA MCA) is the film’s emotional heart. You can watch Beastie Boys Story on Apple TV+. By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung By Adam Cheung A spy thriller coming straight out of Israel, Tehran follows a young Mossad agent as she lands in Iran's capital and quickly sees her mission to disable an Iranian nuclear reactor unravel. In fact, she doesn't even make it out of the airport before things start to go wrong, making for a nail-biting series that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Apple TV+'s first non-English language property, Tehran is worth the extra attention you'll need to pay to keep on top of the subtitles. Just don't binge it all in one go – it's incredibly stressful and you don't want to give yourself heart palpitations. You can watch Tehran on Apple TV+. It's not exactly rare to get a musical artist film at this point. However, Billie Eilish feels particularly made for this kind of personal introspection. In her relatively short-so-far career, the singer, along with her brother Finneas, has surpassed the death knell of internet buzz to become one of the most accomplished and innovative artists we have. Happily, it is void of the trauma in Framing Britney and Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil. Instead, filmmakers show a young artist who is buoyed by her family and provides a fascinating insight into the world of a pop star who spent the back end of her teenage years producing global hits from her childhood bedroom. You can watch Billie Eilish: The World’s A Little Blurry on Apple TV+.

A post shared by smartwater (@smartwater) on Dec 4, 2017 at 6:01am PST Jen’s kitchen has a spacious island, dark counters and backsplash, light wood upper cabinets, and a countertop cookbook collection. From the story, we can spot another cozy neutral sofa, some additional fuzzy pillows, her adorable pups, and a wood burning fireplace in the background. Admittedly, it’s not exactly a full spread in Architectural Digest (like we saw with her former ’70s pad in Beverly Hills, which she sold in 2011), but if you want a grander sense of the space, we happened to find the listing photos from when she bought the place back in 2012. The four bedroom, six and a half bathroom house sits on over three acres of grounds that include its own vineyard. Designed by A. Quincy Jones, Jen reportedly scooped it up for a little under $21 million, according to Curbed LA. She’s probably done a fair share of renovating in the past five years, and as is a celeb real estate trend, probably won’t invite a shelter mag over for a full feature until she decides to sell.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston: The One Where She Breaks the Internet', 'content': 'I\\nf Instagram were a TV series, then it is in the middle of one of those season highlights that you know everyone will be talking about the next day. It’s the explosion episode of Bodyguard, Game of Thrones’s Red Wedding, any season finale of Succession. After the previous week gave birth to the thriller of the year, the Rooney/Vardy you-dunnit, last week provided another blockbuster moment. Jennifer Aniston signed up, posted a selfie with fellow Friends cast members and promptly broke the internet, without so much as a champagne glass poised perilously on a gravity-defying backside. “We are aware that some people were having issues following Jen’s profile,” an Instagram representative told CNN. Even so, she set a Guinness world record for accruing one million followers – it took her five hours and 16 minutes – which meant she beat the previous record set by @sussexroyal. During an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, she called herself “the most reluctant person to ever join Instagram”. Aniston was one of the few A-listers holding out against having a social media presence. Part of me wishes that such reluctance, which has already gained her 13\\u2009\\u2009million followers, was more commonplace. I like watching films, for example, without being tempted to think about what the lead actor’s gym routine looks like. But the former enigmatic distance of the Hollywood elite has long since been replaced with a cutesy, curated-candour, direct-to-fans approach. Aniston’s bio line is “My friends call me Jen”. The Friends pic has a caption that resembled my parents’ liberal approach to caps lock, “And now we’re Instagram FRIENDS too. HI INSTAGRAM”, followed by the waving emoji. If anyone deserves a platform from which they can speak directly to the public, it’s Aniston, who has been the subject of tabloid speculation about her life and womb for decades. She was moved to write about this in a 2016 piece for the Huffington Post, declaring, finally, that she was “fed up” and criticising “how much we define a woman’s value based on her marital and maternal status”. So far, she has posted only gentle pictures and a video, dipping a toe into the muddy waters of the internet, but should she find herself fed up once again, she won’t need to write much more than an Instagram caption, alongside a knowing Smelly Cat meme, to address it. Or perhaps, like everyone else, Aniston simply wanted to know which mystery Colleen was going to solve next. I already love The Batman, with its take-me-seriously definite article. I bet that, as Bruce Wayne, Robert Pattinson will wear wire-framed glasses. He will drink his coffee black. His Batmobile will almost certainly have a top-notch stereo, just so he can make out every word of the latest album by the National. Last week, there were two big casting announcements for Matt Reeves’s take on the least super superhero. After talks with Jonah Hill collapsed, Paul Dano will now play the Riddler, while Zoë Kravitz will take on Catwoman. Both new recruits continue to push the idea that this will be an edgier Batman, particularly Dano, who is one of those actors who seems to menace the screen as soon as he appears. Though Joker has left me wary of taking the fun out of films in this genre (really, can we not just do a few gags, some big explosions and be done with it?), I’m all for a cast that would be right at home in a Sundance grand jury prize winner. However, there is talk of a new “gritty” version of Clueless, too. Another TV series is in development (with respect to the Rachel Blanchard 1996 sitcom) and an unofficial description frames it as “a baby pink and bisexual blue-tinted, tiny sunglasses-wearing, oat milk latte and Adderall-fuelled look at what happens when the high-school queen bee, Cher (played in the 1995 film by Alicia Silverstone), disappears and her lifelong No 2 steps into Cher’s vacant Air Jordans”. Edgy up my Batman, sure, but if the life-affirming silliness of Clueless goes over to the dark side, I will, as Cher says, be buggin’. There are a handful of phrases that will instantly put me off a show before I’ve even seen it – “David Walliams judges”, “8pm sitcom”, “faithful reenactment” – but few descriptions repel as much as “another Ted Bundy documentary”. The serial killer who commissioners just can’t seem to stop loving will be the subject of another examination, this time in the form of a five-part Amazon Prime documentary, Ted Bundy: Falling For a Killer. The series follows the film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, which cast hunky Zac Efron as the murderer and rapist, and then did some moral contortions as to the purpose of its existence, settling on an unconvincing defence of “this is for the victims”. Netflix’s series Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes elicited such a confused reaction from its viewers that its unsettlingly sentient Twitter presence told them off: “I’ve seen a lot of talk about Ted Bundy’s alleged hotness and would like to gently remind everyone that there are literally THOUSANDS of hot men on the service – almost all of whom are not convicted serial murderers.” Even a multibillion-dollar corporation referring to itself as “I” is not as offensive as this ongoing obsession with Bundy.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The 46 Best Shows and Movies on Apple TV+ Right Now (February 2024)', 'content': '   Take flight with Masters of the Air It\\'s a great time to be a history buff with an Apple TV+ subscription. The streamer\\'s new series Masters of the Air, a World War II drama about fighter pilots, is a thrill — exactly what you\\'d expect from producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Meanwhile, balancing out all that wartime glory, Martin Scorsese\\'s Oscar nominated film Killers of the Flower Moon digs into a shameful chapter in American history. And stay tuned for Ridley Scott\\'s Napoleon, expected to hit Apple TV+ soon. This list was last updated Feb. 2; newer additions are at the top. For fans of: Band of Brothers, the internet\\'s favorite boys\\nNumber of seasons: 1 You thought Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks were done making limited series about World War II? Think again. The duo behind Band of Brothers and The Pacific are now bringing us Masters of the Air, which follows a group of airmen, nicknamed the \"Bloody Hundredth,\" who conducted risky bomb raids over Germany during the war. The series doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel, but it\\'s a thrilling spectacle, and the sprawling cast is a real who\\'s who of It boys, including Austin Butler, Barry Keoghan, and Ncuti Gatwa. -Allison Picurro [Trailer] [Review] For fans of: Historical dramas, true stories, Scorcese flicks, prestige films Martin Scorsese has made a lot of excellent films over the course of his lengthy career, but Killers of the Flower Moon might legitimately be his best work. This three-hour epic, about a sleazy businessman and his similarly sleazy nephew (played by Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, respectively) marrying into a wealthy Osage Nation family and then murdering them to try to steal their money, is another heartbreaking character study from one of the masters. Star Lily Gladstone made history as the first Native American woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, and the fourth Indigenous actress to be nominated in that category. She\\'s the beating heart of this story. -Phil Owen [Trailer]   For fans of: crime dramas, British TV, socially aware storytelling\\nNumber of seasons: 1 The eight-episode limited series Criminal Record stars Peter Capaldi and Cush Jumbo as a pair of London police detectives who find themselves at odds over an old murder case that seemingly had a lot more going on than Capaldi\\'s character wants everyone to know. The series promises a tightly wound mystery with plenty of twists to sort through and deep character studies. -Phil Owen [Trailer]   For fans of: Spy dramas, incredibly British things, Gary Oldman rippin\\' toots\\nNumber of seasons: 3 (Renewed through Season 5) Good spy dramas are hard to come by, which makes Slow Horses a refreshing watch in these times of true crime and tech CEOs behaving badly. The series follows a group of MI5 agents who have been relegated to a backwater outpost called Slough House because of past mistakes, where they\\'re supposed to disappear and do grunt work while superstar agents get the glory. Gary Oldman plays the team leader, a disgruntled man who can no longer give an F about anything, while Jack Lowden plays the new member of Slough House who isn\\'t willing to fade away. It\\'s darkly funny and thrilling. In early 2024, Apple TV+ renewed the series for a fifth season before the fourth season even aired. -Tim Surette [Trailer]   More recommendations: For fans of: Putting boots on the moon (and Mars), space travel, alternate history\\nNumber of seasons: 4 What started out as a fun sci-fi drama set in an alternate history in which Russia landed on the the moon before America — locking the two superpowers in an extended space race that lasts for decades — has become one of TV\\'s best shows. Battlestar Galactica\\'s Ronald D. Moore mixes politics, technology, and character drama to create a show that\\'s unlike anything else on TV. After settling on the moon in Season 2 with lunar stations, Season 3 has bigger aspirations of making it to Mars, bringing some of the most breathtaking action sequences the show has ever done while rivals, plus a new private tech firm, attempt to make history. And in Season 4, we\\'re establishing bases on the Red Planet and dealing with labor practices... in space! It\\'s great for space geeks and anyone into speculative fiction. Joel Kinnaman, Wrenn Schmidt, and Krys Marshall star. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Kaiju, the Russell family\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Apple TV+\\'s biggest star is approximately, as the song goes, 30 stories high. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters brings the cinematic MonsterVerse to the small screen, continuing the story from the 2014 film Godzilla and tracking the origin of the secret cabal Monarch, which hunts and studies MUTOs (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms, aka monsters). Kurt Russell plays a man linked to Monarch in the current timeline, while his son Wyatt Russell plays the younger version of him in a flashback timeline. It\\'s a summer blockbuster on your TV, for better or worse. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Bridgerton but younger vibes, stickin\\' it to snobby Brits Need to unstuff a stuffy British period piece? Just add Americans. This adaptation of Edith Wharton\\'s unfinished novel, published in 1938, will no doubt draw appropriate comparisons to Netflix\\'s wildly popular Bridgerton, but the story of five young, new-money American women who head to London in the 1870s to catch British aristocrats for marriage adds a different enough wrinkle to make it stand out. These girls are rowdy and raucous, making the conservative Brits spit out their tea (metaphorically, sadly) at their brash behavior. But behind the culture clashes is a whopper of a love triangle as Nan (future leading lady Kristine Frøseth) finds herself caught between two best friends. A finale that holds its secrets tight until the last minute, sets and costumes that used every farthing of Apple\\'s generous budget, and a youthful energy make this show a fun watch. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The magic of science, Brie Larson speaking like Sheldon Cooper\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Apple TV+\\'s adaptation of Bonnie Garmus\\' best-selling book isn\\'t always able to replicate the full flavors of the source material, but the story of a chemist (Brie Larson) who becomes a cooking TV show host after the misogyny of academia ousts her from her first love creates a hero who is still easy to root for. With shifting perspectives and timeline jumps, it can sometimes bite off more than it can chew, but that same structure also creates some of its most touching and emotional moments. Who knew a dog had so much to say? -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Jon le Carré novels, Errol Morris documentaries Documentary filmmaker Errol Morris is well-known for probing his subjects through interrogation, and he may have met his match with John le Carré (real name David Cornwell), the former MI6 operative and British author known as a master of the espionage thriller, with titles such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Night Agent, and The Constant Gardener in his oeuvre. Morris mixes interviews with dramatic reenactments to crack Cornwell\\'s shell in the author\\'s most revealing talk and final interview before his death in 2020. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The late 1980s, magazines, \"Freedom! \\'90\"\\nNumber of seasons: 1 The easy sell is \"here\\'s four hours with some of the most beautiful women to ever walk the Earth,\" but Apple\\'s four-episode docuseries The Super Models is more than skin deep, looking back on the birth of the super model with the women who created it: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Christy Turlington. The first two episodes filled with never-before-seen footage that charts their rise to fame are the best, and the candid interviews give great insight into the behind-the-scenes world of fashion as it was blowing up into the mainstream. Just don\\'t expect anything too deep. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: The Newsroom, #MeToo, A-listers\\nNumber of seasons: 3 When Apple TV+ launched, it seemed to do so on the back of The Morning Show, its big-budget, high-profile, star-studded drama that was going to win every award out there. Jennifer Aniston AND Reese Witherspoon starring in the same show as rival anchors for a popular morning show? Well, reviews were mixed, and early episodes were less than impressive, but the show righted many of its wrongs as its season continued and spent another season tinkering with its formula. Now in its third season, the series is at its best, which is to say it\\'s embraced the silliness and is going for it with some big swings about topical subjects. Case in point: A billionaire tries to shoot Aniston\\'s character into space in the Season 3 premiere. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Brothers Grimm fairy tales, mysteries, New York City\\nNumber of seasons: 1 The Changeling follows Apollo Kagwa (LaKeith Stanfield), a rare book dealer whose life takes a turn for the supernatural after his wife (Clark Backo) commits an unthinkable act of violence and then promptly disappears. Determined to figure out the truth of what happened to her, Apollo is led on a journey through a version of New York City that he never knew existed. Based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Victor LaVelle, The Changeling is an enchanting, spooky, slow-burning fairy tale. -Allison Picurro [Trailer] For fans of: Jazzercise, internal dialogue filled with nasty insults\\nNumber of seasons: 3 If you miss Netflix\\'s GLOW, you might find some solace in this 1980s-set dramedy that follows a housewife (Rose Byrne) who finds strength in the aerobics craze that\\'s just starting to sweep across the nation\\'s malls. But don\\'t expect the cheery underdog story from GLOW; Byrne\\'s character is struggling with bulimia and spends much of her days hurling nasty body-shaming insults at other women. Byrne excels in the role as an antihero breaking free from the expectations of a traditional housewife in her own morally questionable way. Season 3 is the final season. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Hard science-fiction, great special effects\\nNumber of seasons: 2 One of Apple TV+\\'s biggest gambles is the big-budget science-fiction series Foundation, based on the popular books by Isaac Asimov. I enjoyed Season 1 more than most — though, to be fair, I wasn\\'t familiar with the source material, so I couldn\\'t do any comparisons — but the biggest complaint was that it was uneven and had difficulty bringing Asimov\\'s colossal ideas to television. But the performances are great, particularly from an inspired Lee Pace as the royal villain Brother Day and the always reliable Jared Harris as Hari Seldon. The ambitious premise is too big to explain in a single blurb — basically, some exiles are trying to rebuild society after the collapse of a long-ruling empire — but it\\'s worth checking out if you\\'re a fan of hard sci-fi. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Murder mysteries, your favorite comedians, genre switching\\nNumber of seasons: 2 This comedic murder mystery anthology series combines the plot mechanics of Knives Out with the sense of humor of an Upright Citizens Brigade sketch. The first season — with an all-star cast that includes Ben Schwartz, Sam Richardson, Ilana Glazer, John Early, Tiffany Haddish, Ike Barinholtz, and Jamie Demetriou — focuses on the murder of a pop star at his high school reunion\\'s afterparty. The second season — which brings back Haddish, Richardson, and Zoë Chao and adds the likes of John Cho, Jack Whitehall, and Poppy Liu — tackles a whole new case involving a wedding that\\'s thrown into disarray when the groom is murdered. It\\'s a genre-hopping good time. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]  For fans of: 24 but in the sky and only for 7 hours\\nNumber of seasons: 1 This perfectly fine seven-episode thriller stars Idris Elba as a man on board a flight that gets hijacked by terrorists. The good thing about Elba\\'s character? He\\'s a fantastic business negotiator, which makes him the perfect hero to negotiate with the terrorists. Each episode represents an hour of the ordeal, so there is a good sense of a ticking clock going on. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Chaotic best friends\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Despite what When Harry Met Sally taught us, in Platonic, straight men and women can just be friends. This endearingly silly comedy, created by Nicholas Stoller and Francesca Delbanco, reunites Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen as a pair of old friends who reconnect after years apart, which leads to chaos — and some constructive change — as they both reconsider what they want their lives to look like. It\\'s a fun hangout comedy with a dash of midlife crisis. As Keith Phipps says in his review, \"Beneath gags about late-night cell phone etiquette, nightmarish home renovation projects, and raccoons is a bittersweet exploration of giving up youthfulness for middle age, what\\'s lost and gained in the exchange, and the realization that your true friends are the ones still with you on the other side.\" -Kelly Connolly [Trailer] For fans of: Michael J. Fox! Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth) directs this documentary on 1980s Hollywood legend Michael J. Fox, whose career was paused by a Parkinson\\'s diagnosis. The film works because it embodies the optimistic spirit of Fox, whose wit and charm push Still into an uplifting tale of persevering rather than a sad story of what could have been. Guggenheim\\'s use of classic Fox clips to push the narrative forward will only remind you of just how great Fox was and is. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Sci-fi murder mysteries, deep holes in the ground\\nNumber of seasons: 1 This new sci-fi series — an adaptation of Hugh Howey\\'s 2012 book Wool — from Justified\\'s Graham Yost starts off with a rough first episode, but the story — a near-future dystopian murder mystery set in an underground facility where the last surviving thousands of humans live — really gets chugging in Episode 2. That\\'s when we\\'re introduced to Rebecca Ferguson\\'s Juliette, an engineer discovering that a series of murders just might be related to the rule-makers of their subterranean abode. Fair warning: This moody and drab drama is for hard sci-fi lovers or fans of Scandinavian noir. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Musical comedies, corn pudding\\nNumber of seasons: 2 Despite being perfectly enjoyable, musical comedy series don\\'t have the most successful track record (Galavant, where art thou?). But Apple TV+\\'s genre-busting series Schmigadoon! is bucking the trend in a good way. Keegan-Michael Key and Cecily Strong star as a couple who come across a magical town where everyone seems stuck in a 1940s musical. They get stuck in the town, which makes it a bit of a Twilight Zone episode or horror movie where everyone sings about corn pudding. Also, Martin Short plays a leprechaun. This show is goofy on the outside, but secretly twisted. In the fantastic Season 2, the series shifts to \"Schmicago\" to lampoon musicals from the \\'60s and \\'70s. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Small town comedies, existential questions, comically large bowls of spaghetti\\nNumber of seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) Chris O\\'Dowd stars in this comfortably whimsical comedy about citizens of a small town who get in a tizzy when a mysterious machine called The Morpho arrives with a promise to reveal their life potential on a little blue card. Seeing how these regular folk take to archery, motorcycle riding, and other hobbies they previously had no interest in is both hilarious and thought-provoking, as questions of prophecy, latent desires, and divine intervention swirl around your head. But the real draw here is the charming cast and the characters they bring to life with intertwining stories sharpened with a bit of mystery. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Making fun of Americans, making fun of the British, sports, feeling good\\nNumber of seasons: 3 If any show can be credited with restoring faith in humanity after the whirlwind of 2020, it is Ted Lasso. The titular Ted (Jason Sudeikis) is an American college football coach who heads to England to coach an actual football (soccer, for the uninitiated) team. While the setup seems like a farce -- Ted\\'s hiring is part of an elaborate scheme by an embittered woman looking to ruin the beloved football team of her cheating ex-husband -- Ted\\'s seemingly unshakeable good nature and determination to see the best in everyone, even those actively trying to do him harm, is downright inspiring. He doesn\\'t just bring a glow to everyone around him; he leaves viewers with hope that things can get better and that doing your best is enough. He\\'s the hero we didn\\'t know we needed. Season 3 might be the last season of the show, or it might not. Sudeikis and Apple are being extremely non-committal, probably because Apple is holding up a check with a lot of numbers on it to keep it going despite the producers\\' insistence that the originally planned three-season arc is finished. -Megan Vick [Trailer]  For fans of: Complaining, watching someone being forced to do something they don\\'t want to\\nNumber of seasons: 1 If you find travel shows too packed with things like \"wonder\" and \"enthusiasm\" from their eager hosts, then take a tour of the world with Schitt\\'s Creek\\'s Eugene Levy. As the title implies, Levy would rather loaf around in the comforts of his temperature-controlled home, but here he\\'s visiting beautiful spots like Finland, the Maldives, and Venice, complaining about the weather the entire time. But that\\'s the attraction of the show; Levy\\'s whining is actually more of a draw then the spots he\\'s in, making this less of a travel show and more of a one-man play. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Ted Lasso, crossing boundaries, sad sacks\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Ted Lasso\\'s Brett Goldstein and Bill Lawrence team up with Jason Segel for this tragi-com about a therapist (Segel) swirling the toilet bowl of life after his wife dies. So what he decides to do is tell it to his patients like it is, obliterating the professional boundaries of therapists. But because this is a TV show from the same team that said a football coach could go to England and coach a soccer team, the advice works! Harrison Ford and Jessica Williams also star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Psychological horror from M. Night Shyamalan, babies, food\\nNumber of seasons: 4 The claustrophobic thriller Servant, created by Tony Basgallop and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan, began as a wild-eyed but mechanically precise story about a family unraveling in the wake of a tragedy. In Season 1, Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose) and Sean Turner (Toby Kebbell) hired live-in nanny Leanne (Nell Tiger Free) to care for the lifelike \"reborn doll\" that a grieving Dorothy believed was her son — only for the doll to somehow become a living baby. Now, the show has gone full-on supernatural as Leanne\\'s true nature has come out. It\\'s the details that make this show stand out, like the rich wallpaper of the Turners\\' Philadelphia brownstone, the wet, wet, shoes of Leanne\\'s weird uncle (Boris McGiver), and the most unsettling food design since Hannibal. The fourth and final season is now airing. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]  For fans of: The immigrant experience, anthologies, crying your eyes out in a good way\\nNumber of seasons: 2 If you need a nice pick-me-up from the ills of the world, this anthology series from Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, and Master of None\\'s Alan Yang is a good bet. Each episode of Little America is based on the true stories of immigrants in America, showing off their successes and experiences in humorous and heartwarming fashion, like the Indian spelling bee whiz who ran his parents\\' hotel after they were deported and petitioned Laura Bush to help him get them back. The best part of the show is that it focuses on the systemic challenges they face rather than on hate from racist individuals, and the stories vary wildly so they don\\'t feel repetitive. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Action and artsiness at the same time, guns but emotion\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Imagine if Strike Back, the great Cinemax action series, took some time to appreciate the beauty of life and nature in between blowing things up. That\\'s kind of like what Echo 3 is. The series hails from Mark Boal, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Hurt Locker, and follows a scientist (Jessica Ann Collins) who gets captured by South American rebels and the ensuing mission to get her back by her husband (Michiel Huisman) and brother (Luke Evans), who both happen to be Special Forces. I\\'m not sure the intense, no-frills action sequences, the meaning-of-life pondering shots of nature, and the emotional flashback snippets belong in the same show together, but for those looking for an elevated military drama, this is it, even if it doesn\\'t always work. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Workplace comedies, the video game industry\\nNumber of seasons: 3 (+special episodes) It\\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\'s Rob McElhenney is smart enough to know that video games are funny, but they\\'re not to be made fun of. Gamers are legion, after all. The game biz gets a loving sendup in Mythic Quest without making gamers the joke, as McElhenney plays the egotistical creative director of a popular MMORPG that\\'s seemingly always in trouble in some way or another. F. Murray Abraham leaves the show in Season 3 (in spectacular fashion, I might add), but the excellent cast still includes Danny Pudi, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, David Hornsby, Imani Hakim, and Charlotte Nicdao, who\\'s one of TV\\'s most underrated talents. Even with a third season that doesn\\'t hit like the previous two, this is one of TV\\'s best workplace comedies. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Selena Gomez, getting to know a down-to-earth megastar You can watch Selena Gomez in streaming originals on Netflix (The Fundamentals of Caring), Hulu (Only Murders in the Building), or HBO Max (Selena + Chef), but now you can really see who Selena Gomez is on Apple TV+. This documentary follows Selena as she struggles with stardom, accepts her diagnoses of lupus, bipolar disorder, and depression, and turns her focus on helping herself and others. It\\'s a must-see for Selena fans, and an ought-to-see for everyone else looking for a cathartic film about one\\'s truth. -Tim Surette [Trailer]      For fans of: Hard work, sunny vibes, telenovelas\\nNumber of seasons: 2 (Renewed for Season 3) If you need to wash the day away, you can\\'t do much better than checking into the Las Colinas resort in Acapulco, the setting for this comedy about a young man who gets a dream job working at a high-end resort in Mexico. The 1980s-set bilingual comedy -- it\\'s about 50/50 English and Spanish -- is like Jane the Virgin meets The White Lotus meets How I Met Your Mother, as Maximo (Enrique Arrizon) works his way up from pool boy in 1984 to wealthy hotelier in the present-day timeline. It\\'s charming, it\\'s sunny, and it\\'s got a pair of lounge singers who belt out \\'80s classics in Spanish. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Big Little Lies, Irish accents, cinematography\\nNumber of Seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) The great Sharon Horgan (Catastrophe) created and stars in this Irish series that\\'s something like Big Little Lies as a dark comedy. It\\'s about five sisters — played by Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Eva Birthistle, Sarah Greene, and Eve Hewson — one of whom is married to a truly awful man played by Claes Bang, who, when the show begins, is dead. The show unfolds over two timelines, and there\\'s a mystery in each one: What happened to him and how exactly the sisters were involved in his death in the past, and whether they\\'ll be able to keep the secret in the present. It\\'s thrillingly biting in Horgan\\'s signature way. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]        For fans of: Mindhunter, prison stories\\nNumber of Seasons: 1 Black Bird is one of this year\\'s rarest birds: a true crime adaptation that actually feels fresh — and horrifying. Developed by novelist Dennis Lehane and based on James Keene\\'s autobiographical novel In With the Devil, the drama series stars Taron Egerton as Keene, who\\'s facing a 10-year prison sentence before he gets an unexpected offer: He\\'ll be freed if he can befriend and tease a confession out of a suspected serial killer (Paul Walter Hauser). Ray Liotta, in one of his final roles, plays Jimmy\\'s father, an ex-cop with his own burdens. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]        For fans of: Dancing at bat and bar mitzvahs, crowd-pleasing tearjerkers Cooper Raiff is having his Hollywood moment. The young writer, director, and star of Cha Cha Real Smooth saw his film take home the Sundance Audience Prize earlier this year, leading Apple to gobble it up (Apple did the same with CODA, which went on to win Best Picture). Raiff plays 22-year-old Andrew, whose charm earns him a job as a party starter at bat and bar mitzvahs, which leads him to fall for an engaged mother (Dakota Johnson) of an autistic child. Post-college confusion ensues as Andrew struggles to find his place in the world, making CCRS a coming-of-age story with laughs and tears. It won\\'t win Best Picture, but it\\'s one of the easiest movies to watch this year. -Tim Surette [Trailer]     For fans of: Thunder lizards, better than average CGI, David Attenborough\\nNumber of seasons: 1 The whole \"it\\'s a regular nature show, but with dinosaurs\" thing has been attempted many times ever since we first caught a glimpse of a brachiosaurus in the original Jurassic Park. The results have been mixed, with most failing to deliver good-looking dinos, but technology is finally at a place where computers can whip up herds of dinosaurs that require a second glance to check if they\\'re real or not. And that realism is important for the emotional impact; ever see a baby pterosaur in a life-or-death race with a predator? With Father Nature David Attenborough narrating and five episodes divided up by biomes, it\\'s the closest we\\'ve come to Planet Earth for dinosaurs. -Tim Surette [Trailer]        For fans of: Mythological creatures, star-crossed romance, picturesque English countrysides\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Apple TV+\\'s adaptation of Sarah Perry\\'s 2016 novel, in which a sea serpent — or at least the possibility of one — terrorizes Essex, England in Victorian times, is the rare period romance and folk horror combo packed with star power. Claire Danes plays the naturalist hunting down the monster, while Tom Hiddleston plays the reverend who\\'s sort of like the Scully to Danes\\' Mulder. What starts as a monster hunt quickly becomes a witch hunt as the townspeople turn on Danes\\' character. Lots of juicy metaphors here! The six-episode season is more of a simmer than a boil, but it\\'s gorgeously shot and the performances are excellent. -Tim Surette [Trailer]       For fans of: Homeland, thrillers, stress, espionage\\nNumber of seasons: 2 Aside from Amazon\\'s Tom Clancy\\'s Jack Ryan and whatever passes for a thriller on NBC these days, American television has mostly backed away from international espionage dramas that were once such a hot ticket. To get your spy thrills, you need to look elsewhere, like the Israeli spy thriller Tehran. The International Emmy winner for Best Drama last year, Tehran follows Tamar Rabinyan (Niv Sultan), a female Mossad agent navigating a world of espionage, double crosses, and her cultural quandary as she was born in Iran. After attempting to shut down Iran\\'s plans for atomic weapons in Season 1, Glenn Close joined the cast in Season 2 as a British agent. -Tim Surette [Trailer]          For fans of: Brooding murder mysteries, sci-fi twists, early \\'90s Chicago indie rock\\nNumber of seasons: 1 Somewhere underneath Elisabeth Moss\\'s innocent exterior is a goth girl with a love for the morbid. Following dark roles in The Handmaid\\'s Tale, Top of the Lake, and The Invisible Man, things don\\'t get any cheerier in Shining Girls, in which she plays a woman working at the Chicago Sun-Times who is hunting down a serial killer (Jamie Bell) who previously assaulted her during a murder attempt. The twist here is that she finds herself slipping through different realities — multiverse? wormhole? an extreme practical joke? — with the only real constant being the killer and the case. Wagner Moura plays the reporter helping her, and Chris Chalk plays a Times photographer who is also someone a lot closer to her, at least in one reality. Moss is her usual excellent self, Bell is certifiably creepy, and it checks all the boxes for being a competent murder mystery. Plus, Leonardo DiCaprio produced it! -Tim Surette [Trailer]          For fans of: The weekend, r/antiwork, brain-melting thrillers\\nNumber of seasons: 1 (Renewed for Season 2) The whole idea of work-life balance gets revisited with a technological twist in this sci-thriller that will make you want to quit your day job. Mark (Adam Scott) works at Lumon Industries, where a new procedure implants a chip into employees\\' brains that severs their consciousness into their work life and personal life, splitting their life in two so that neither knows what the other does. Obviously, Lumon is up to no good, and as the employees get closer to the truth, the line between their work lives and personal lives blurs. Scott is joined by a tremendous cast that includes Patricia Arquette, John Turturro, and Christopher Walken, and Ben Stiller and Aoife McArdle work magic behind the camera with one of the best-looking shows in a while. It is WEIRD, yet weaves a complicated conspiracy that will have you hooked. -Tim Surette [Trailer]  For fans of: Willy Shakespeare, a Coen brother, Denzel Washington Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand star in this adaptation of Shakespeare\\'s Scottish play. It\\'s the first solo film from a Coen brother — McDormand\\'s husband Joel directs, adapts, and produces along with her. If you love art movies, there\\'s not much else that needs to be said to get you to watch this. I mean, it\\'s Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as Lord and Lady Macbeth. It\\'s kind of historic, in all its black-and-white, Expressionist glory. It was nominated for three Oscars and didn\\'t win any, which only bolsters its artistic credibility. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]  For fans of: Art films, innovation, rock band turbulence Film auteur Todd Haynes directed this documentary on one of America\\'s most groundbreaking rock bands, The Velvet Underground. But rather than the simple talking heads, live footage, repeat structure used in most rock docs, Haynes gets to the essence of the band by making the film an arthouse gem that Lou Reed and company would have loved. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s still loaded with VU tunes and insight into the tumultuous relationship between Reed and his bandmates, it just looks extra trippy while doing so. Put simply, this is one of the best music documentaries ever made. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Heartwarming movies, Deaf culture A remake of the 2014 French film La Famille Bélier, CODA (which stands for Child of Deaf Adults) is a coming-of-age story about a 17-year-old girl (Emilia Jones) who is the only hearing member of her Deaf family, and must choose between pursuing her own dreams of becoming a singer or helping her mother and father with the family business. It\\'s a crowd-pleasing tearjerker, with a wonderful performance from Jones. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first movie released by a streaming service to do so. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Psychological and erotic thrillers, getting mindf---ed, delicious subtext\\nNumber of seasons: 1 One of the most intriguing releases of 2021, the Israeli psychological drama is lathered up in erotically charged mystery that takes cues from the greats of the film world. Writer-director Sigal Avin leans on Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, and more for influences in her story about an aging female director (Ayelet Zurer) who becomes obsessed with a young, seductive screenwriter (Lihi Kornowski) and the film that might save her career but destroy her marriage. It\\'s wonderfully shot and loaded with beautiful people, if that\\'s your thing. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Politics, Lord of the Flies, the future of America, chaos Boys State was one of the best documentaries of 2020. The film follows the annual Boys State, a summer camp (this particular one\\'s in Texas) sponsored by the American Legion in which more than 1,000 high school boys come together to form their own two-party government, complete with elections, voting, and mudslinging. It\\'s a remarkable look at the pitfalls of our current political system, hyper-masculinity among teen boys, and the future of America (it looks like we\\'re in both good and bad hands). Beyond the fascinating subject matter, the filmmaking is superb and gorgeous, feeling more like a scripted movie than a guerilla-shot documentary, which is a compliment in this case. If you like Lord of the Flies or Kid Nation (which, how can you not?), you\\'re going to love this. -Tim Surette [Trailer] For fans of: Period pieces with anachronisms, Wiz Khalifa\\nNumber of seasons: 3 Every early headline about Dickinson, an Apple TV+ show about Emily Dickinson, felt like a fever dream: John Mulaney guest starring as Henry David Thoreau! Wiz Khalifa playing Death! The show, which stars Hailee Steinfeld as the great American poet in her younger years, is the sort of beautiful gamble that could either soar or fall on its face, with almost no room for anything in between. It worked out — Dickinson totally rules. A delirious, anachronistic period piece, it\\'s both a very funny show and a surreal elegy for all the great art lost to misogyny. It\\'s as bold and haunting as the work of its heroine. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]  For fans of: The LGBTQ+ community, the progressive movement, television history Apple TV+\\'s expansive and carefully paced history of LGBTQ+ people on TV deserves kudos for its thoughtful, authoritative, and exhausting summation. Even if it weren\\'t packed with the most well-known queer people on TV, Visible: Out on Television does an excellent job of tracking how gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and non-binary people have been depicted on television from its earliest days — including the frantic, hyper-paranoid news reports of the 1950s declaring queer people a menacing threat. It\\'s practically a college course, methodically chronicling representation throughout the decades through archival footage, news reports, and the like, but its abundant first-person testimonials from practically every living LGBTQ+ TV star you can think of (plus allies like Oprah, Billy Crystal and more) make Visible: Out on Television an invaluable educational tool for everyone who watches. -Malcolm Venable [Trailer]  For fans of: The wonderful Cartoon Saloon films, wolves, Irish mythology (and accents) The beautifully animated film Wolfwalkers came out in theaters in 2020, but there\\'s about a 99% chance you didn\\'t see it because of, well, obvious reasons. It\\'s the third in a series of films based on Irish folklore from the studio Cartoon Saloon, following the critically acclaimed The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea (highly recommended), and tells the story of a young girl who heads to Ireland from England with her dad to kill off the last wolf pack but ends up befriending a young girl who is part of a tribe of humans who become wolves at night. It\\'s less Disney and Pixar and more Hayao Miyazaki, and it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Pop some corn and gather the family for movie night. -Tim Surette [Trailer] ', 'source_domain': 'www.tvguide.com', 'url': 'https://www.tvguide.com/news/best-apple-tv-shows-movies/', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jamie Foxx’s ‘anti-Semitic’ Instagram post draws ire; Jennifer Aniston receives backlash for liking it', 'content': 'While Hollywood actor Jamie Foxx‘s recent, and now deleted, “anti-Semitic” Instagram post is facing significant criticism, actor Jennifer Aniston has also found herself embroiled in controversy after it was discovered that she liked the post. A few hours ago, Foxx shared a message on his Instagram feed and story that many perceived as anti-Semitic. “They killed this dude name Jesus… what do you think they’ll do to you? #fakefriends #fakelove,” Foxx wrote in all caps. The post quickly went viral, with many people condemning the actor for its offensive content. Meanwhile, some netizens noticed that Jennifer Aniston had also liked the post, leading to further backlash as people accused her of endorsing the “anti-Semitic” message. Now, the actor herself has taken the opportunity to address the issue and firmly stated her stance against any form of hate. “This really makes me sick. I did not ‘like’ this post on purpose or by accident. And more importantly, I want to be clear to my friends and anyone hurt by this showing up in their feeds – I do NOT support any form of antisemitism,” she stated in an Instagram story. “I truly don’t tolerate HATE of any kind. Period,” she added, attaching a screenshot of Foxx’s post that has since been removed. However, there has not been any response from Jamie Foxx yet. A fortnight ago, Foxx had shared a selfie video on Instagram narrating about his health, after he went through an undisclosed medical condition.     A post shared by Jamie Foxx (@iamjamiefoxx) “I went to hell and back, and my road to recovery has some potholes as well, but I’m coming back,” Foxx said in the video. “I’m able to work.” According to Associated Press, Foxx, 55, was hospitalised in April with what his daughter, Corinne Fox, described at the time as a “medical complication.” Foxx did not disclose the nature of his condition in his first public comments since being hospitalised.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '', 'content': \"The Morning Show season 3 introduces a new romance between Jon Hamm and Jennifer Aniston that fixes a decade of lackluster romantic comedies. Despite the fact that Jon Hamm and Jennifer Aniston have starred in countless movies and television series with major romantic storylines, their most recent romance in The Morning Show season 3 makes all of those previous appearances look completely platonic. The Morning Show is an Apple TV drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston as world-famous newscasters, handling the highs and lows of broadcast television. In the most recent installment, Jon Hamm joins The Morning Show season 3 cast as a charming tech billionaire looking to buy the news network. Aniston and Hamm have taken on a carousel of roles over the years, many of which include romance. After Friends, Aniston starred in a variety of romantic comedies including Along Came Polly, Just Go With It, and He's Just Not That Into You. On the other hand, Jon Hamm hasn't necessarily dominated the rom-com genre, but he has certainly been portrayed as a womanizer, especially in his most well-known role, Don Draper in Mad Men. Despite this, these characters and relationships are nothing compared to what Hamm and Aniston have brewing on The Morning Show. Over the course of The Morning Show season 3, the romantic tension between Jennifer Aniston's Alex and Jon Hamm's Paul is hard to ignore. Although Alex attempts to take the moral high ground throughout the season, making up for her past failures, she can't seem to resist Paul's charms. Everything comes to a head in The Morning Show season 3, episode 6 when Alex conducts an interview with Paul to see whether he can be trusted, and Paul shows his true self. Thus, their tension reaches its peak and the two have sex. Shockingly, by the end of the episode, this leads to them starting up a committed romantic relationship. Ultimately, what makes the Alex and Paul romance so much better than Aniston and Hamm's decade of on-screen romances is the intimate adult connection between them. Although they share a strong attraction to each other, their relationship is not diminished by this physical aspect. Instead, their first intimate moments include them really connecting on a personal level, and thus, the romance quickly follows the sexual tension. This type of complex yet mature romance completely outweighs the silly situations of Aniston's rom-coms or the surface level, affair-ridden relationships of Don Draper. Ultimately, it is a romance that is sure to be messy but seems inevitable. Despite the joy Alex and Paul's romance brings, it likely won't end well for the characters or their peers. First and foremost, Paul is essentially the enemy of The Morning Show season 3, which makes their romance a strange sort of betrayal. Also, this is the second questionable man that Alex has attached herself to, and if it ends badly, it could hurt her reputation for good. Finally, either Alex or Paul could hurt the other, and because of their work associations, this could damage their careers as well. In the end, this The Morning Show romance is so tightly intertwined with the characters' lives that disaster seems imminent.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The Morning Show Has a Star Problem', 'content': 'The series should capture the wild ambition and tense charms of the TV business. Its leads don’t telegraph any of that. Ah, The Morning Show. Less a television series, really, than a vibe—plotlines that were topical two years ago, ageless female faces, constant chaos that you should simply allow to wash over you like rain. Does it make sense? Not at all. You could watch other shows, and you would never see this: Jennifer Aniston’s frown-acting, Reese Witherspoon’s pissed-off listlessness, Billy Crudup harnessing all the frantic charisma of Satan losing at poker. The first episode of the new season begins with the broadcast-morning-show host Alex Levy (played by Aniston) watching her own TV obituary, and ends with the news anchor Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon) in literal space, weeping in zero gravity while bemoaning the war in Ukraine. What other series has the creative capacity, the daring, the money to do something so grand and so pointless? TV like this is a gift. And yet. The Morning Show is so close to something like greatness. You can see, in the new episodes, all of the ways in which the series knows what works (dazzling one-liners; the absurdity of a TV program that requires anchors to segue from pie-eating contests to racism) while also being handicapped by the most unshiftable hindrance of all: its stars. When it was first conceived, the show was the jewel in Apple TV+’s crown—a fictionalized adaptation of Brian Stelter’s 2013 book about the vicious world of morning-news programs, whose premise set up two of America’s most beloved actresses to tussle over ratings. However, the #MeToo allegations about the news anchor Matt Lauer prompted the series to retool itself around the subject of workplace predation, which clashed with its hammy, quippy, All About Eve–esque setup and left its two central characters somewhat adrift. The first season, for me at least, was a nonsensical volley between glorious excess and Sorkinian sincerity, never finding cohesion between the two. The second leaned closer toward cheerful camp but inexplicably decided to rewrite Steve Carell’s disgraced anchor, Mitch Kessler, as a flawed but tragic victim of cancel culture. Its characters were thinner than crepe paper, and multiple-episode arcs (about tell-all books and ominous lawsuits) were discarded when more enticing storylines came up. Read: What went wrong with The Morning Show? Having watched all of Season 3, I’ve come to the conclusion that the issue with the show’s two leads isn’t just that after 30 episodes of television, neither has yet managed to read a teleprompter with even a hint of animation. For The Morning Show to thrive, it needs either Alex or Bradley—or both—to embrace antiheroism, yet both are played by actors so recognizable and likable on-screen that explicit villainy seems well out of their range. The first episode of the new season, set in March 2022, loosely explains where the two women stand: Alex, having withstood an early and televised bout of COVID two years ago, has parlayed her “survivor” status into a hit streaming show called Alex Unfiltered; Bradley, thanks to her audacious footage from the U.S. Capitol on January 6, is now the country’s top evening-news anchor, reporting “controversial” stories that the network keeps threatening to kill. (Don’t think too hard about how Bradley went from being a field reporter for a local-news station in West Virginia to achieving Diane Sawyer–like status practically overnight despite constantly going off-script and not showing up to work for several weeks in Season 2, because it’ll make your brain hurt.) Season 3 has a new showrunner, a new team of writers, and, apparently, a new fascination with the business side of television. This last preoccupation is possibly a knock-on effect of Succession’s popularity, but it’s also possibly because Crudup’s Cory Ellison, an executive at The Morning Show’s parent network, United Broadcast Association, is the only person showing us what the series should be about: deranged ambition, unnerving pizzazz, extreme self-awareness. Knowing that UBA is basically broke, Cory has hatched a plan for a merger with a company owned by Paul Marks (Jon Hamm), a billionaire who’s into space rockets and filthy lucre. Standing only partially in the way is Greta Lee’s Stella Bak, UBA’s head of news, who previously worked with Paul and will only say, between gritted teeth, that he’s “ruthless.” The season dips into serious and timely issues (the murder of George Floyd, the overturning of Roe v. Wade) but seems much more interested in creating set pieces that let Cory wield his offbeat magnetism. When he struts into a network presentation for advertisers, backslapping stars and glad-handing executives to the soundtrack of the Bee Gees’ “Stayin’ Alive,” the music appears to be playing just for him, which has the effect of bringing us into his mind more than any other character’s. Late in the season, we get to witness a charged reunion between Cory and his mother (Lindsay Duncan) that’s loaded with more emotional violence than a Pinter play. Every other confrontation this season—Bradley and her Trump-supporting brother, Alex and the ultra-acquisitive board, Bradley and her icy ex-lover—has the tension of cheese curds by comparison. (The show adds a new presenter, Chris Hunter, played gracefully by Nicole Beharie, but it doesn’t let her have much of a good time.) You can almost sense the writers’ relief at having someone as fiendish as Cory to write for. Imagine a series in which every character could be this peacocking, this nakedly self-interested, this fun. One of the new characters introduced in Season 3 is an unnamed anchor at a rival network who obsessively covers the turmoil at UBA, and who does so with more dynamism and interest than any on-air talent at The Morning Show has managed to muster. Meanwhile, even as Bradley makes one bad decision after another, Witherspoon plays her so sympathetically that we can’t condemn her. Alex gets close to revealing her lust for power, but Aniston resists giving us glimpses of her moral complexity. People will watch The Morning Show regardless, because this kind of star power is a hell of a hook. Still, I can’t help wondering if it’s also a curse—especially when there are actually interesting stories that a show could tell.

On Thursday, Apple TV+ released a first look at the upcoming third season of the drama series. The photos include a first look at Jon Hamm, who is joining the show this season, as well as returning stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass. During the third season of the acclaimed series, “the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized, and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom,” according to an official synopsis from the streamer. COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ In August, The Wrap reported that Hamm was set to take part in the upcoming 10-episode season of The Morning Show, which premieres Sept. 13. The Mad Men alum, 52, plays a \"corporate titan\" named Paul Marks who \"sets his sights on UMB,\" meaning plenty of potential changes for the folks at the media company, including Alex (Aniston), Bradley (Witherspoon) and Cory (Crudup). Teasing what\\'s to come, Witherspoon, 47, previously told Entertainment Tonight that the upcoming third season is \"so good.\" \"We obviously added Jon Hamm, which has been so fun,\" she continued. \"We have all these new cast members who have just upped the game.\" COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ In terms of teasing the plot, Witherspoon added, \"I will say, there is lots of romance this year.\" The cast for the third season also includes Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Nicole Beharie, and Julianna Margulies.  COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ The Morning Show was picked up for a fourth season last month after filming on the upcoming season wrapped in February. At the conclusion of the shoot, Witherspoon, 47, posted a series of behind-the-scenes photos from the set of the Apple TV+ drama, including one snuggly shot of her and Aniston. COURTESY OF APPLE TV+ \"Last days of shooting @themorningshow! Season 3 is on the WAY!\" she captioned the carousel, which included photos with Crudup, Margulies, Lee, and Hamm. In her own post, Aniston, 54, also celebrated the end of filming. \"That\\'s a wrap on Season 3 🥹👏🏼Love love LOVE this @themorningshow crew —❤️ So much more to come 😘💥!!\" wrote the Friends alum on Instagram alongside a carousel of photos featuring costars Witherspoon, Duplass and Marcia Gay Harden.

With an Instagram ID that is simply “jenniferaniston” and just hours after the actress joined the social media site fans were no longer able to follow her. HOW MUHC IS JENNIFER ANISTON WORTH? An Instagram representative told the New York Post’s Page Six, \\'We are aware that some people are having issues following Jen\\'s page - the volume of interest is incredible!

Four of her co-stars on the show, which just celebrated its 25th anniversary - Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer – have IG accounts, with the only exception being Matthew Perry. One of the followers who joined her online was her ex-husband Justin Theroux, who liked her first post and also took to the comments section and wrote: \\'Woot-woot! #first,\\' adding several emojis including a heart. Cox also left a comment on Aniston’s maiden pic, writing \\'love you,\\' along with two black hearts and two clapping emojis.

There are still some sparks flying for Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt despite their messy split over a decade ago, a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “Brad and Jen have a wonderful connection that might seem flirtatious at times,” says the source. “They dig each other’s sense of humor and have an infectious energy when they’re together, but they insist things are purely platonic and nothing more than that.”  The Morning Show actress and the Ad Astra star, 56, ended their 5-year marriage in October 2005. One month after finalizing their divorce, Pitt moved on to Angelina Jolie, whom he split from in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 10 years together. Any bad feelings the exes had for one another is clearly long passed them. Pitt attended the Friends alum’s holiday party at her Bel-Air, California, home earlier this month. He also went to Aniston’s 50th birthday bash in February. “It took a while for Jen to heal and for Brad to stop feeling bad for how he left her back in 2005,” adds the source. “This is something they’ve taken their time with, and they’re well aware of the hysteria around their relationship among their fans.”  The lines of communication are very open between them, adds the source. “Their bond is solid. They’ve come a really long way.” For more on Aniston and Pitt’s relationship, watch the video above and pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '‘Morning Show’ Boss After Cliffhanger Finale: Season 2 Will Be “Escaping From the Wreckage”', 'content': \"  The boss of Apple's 'The Morning Show,' Kerry Ehrin, discusses the cliffhanger season one finale and hints at how it will affect season two in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. BY JACKIE STRAUSE  [This story contains major spoilers from the season one finale of Apple TV+‘s The Morning Show.] “We haven’t been honest with you.”  That’s how the anchors played by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon open their searing on-air takedown of the broadcast network home to The Morning Show. After 10 episodes of delivering a nuanced, layered and multi-faceted portrayal of a morning news show culture rife with misogyny, toxicity and sexual misconduct, the Apple TV+ drama from showrunner Kerry Ehrin laid all of its cue cards out on the table in the final moments of its season one finale.   “The abuse of power, the corporate corruption, it has to end. We cannot accept a culture of silence,” proclaims co-anchor Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon) after name-checking network boss Fred Mickland (Tom Irwin) as central in an environment that silenced women who came forward with claims of sexual misconduct. Knowing they only have one minute to deliver their manifesto before someone pulls the plug, Bradley and veteran anchor Alex Levy (Aniston) go rogue and — with the assistance of news boss Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) — they lay bare all of The Morning Show‘s secrets for America, including disgraced anchor Mitch Kessler’s (Steve Carell) inappropriate relationship with a female producer and Alex’s own complicity in turning a blind eye to his pervasive behavior. After previously defending the “boys’ club” of The Morning Show, Alex admits to viewers, “I’m as culpable as anyone in not calling out or helping to end the sexual misconduct that goes on in this fucking building.”  Alex apologizes to the women of The Morning Show, namely Mitch’s ex Mia Jordan (Karen Pittman), and vows to do everything she can to make it right. “Corporate culture comes from the top down, and Fred Mickland dictated a culture of fear and silence and paranoia and pain, and it permeated everything,” Alex declares through tears. “As many Fred Micklands are out there, there are billions more people like me and like Bradley and like you.” But before Bradley can close out their message, the feed to the nationally broadcast morning show cuts out. The finale ends in deafening silence, as fired executive producer Chip Black (Mark Duplass) watches a blank screen from Times Square, and Mitch, bruised after a beatdown from Chip, stares blankly into space with a look of realization: He is just like the predators and monsters he had self-righteously separated himself from all season long. Only moments earlier, Mitch, Chip and the entire staff of The Morning Show learned that Hannah Schoenfeld (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the producer whom Mitch assaulted while on location in Las Vegas, had died of a drug overdose. The tragic news prompted Alex and Bradley to go on-air and blow it all up.   The Morning Show launched by setting up Mitch as a casualty of the #MeToo movement — a man who abused his power by having extramarital affairs with women he worked with and got taken down. But in the eighth episode, which played out in flashback form, Mitch was unmasked to be the monster he had been running from. He took advantage of junior staffer Hannah when he invited her to his hotel room and had sex with her. At the time, he viewed the night as consensual. But through a painstaking performance by Mbatha-Raw, viewers come to realize in the penultimate episode and finale just how much the trauma of that night, when she was sexually assaulted by her boss, haunted Hannah for the rest of her life. “When you actually see [the assault] happen, it breaks your heart,” showrunner Ehrin tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It breaks your heart for her in the largest way. But it was such an avoidable incident. And it changed her life forever. That absolutely changed her life forever, and that is tragic.” Below, in a chat with THR, Ehrin digs into the nuances of the #MeToo story at the center of the first season and explains why she left Hannah’s death open-ended. She also unpacks the bombshell that Alex and Bradley dropped on the network and explains how it will impact the show when it returns for season two, which might include Carell’s Mitch: “It’s like a huge building fell on everybody and it’s about escaping from the wreckage.”   What happens between Mitch (Carell) and Hannah (Mbatha-Raw) unravels over the final three episodes and explores each of their perspectives. Why did you want to tell their story in this narrative way? I definitely wanted it to all to circle around Hannah. I wanted to show the story of a person who got thrust into a situation that she didn’t ask for and that she didn’t know how to extricate herself from at any point, and how that circled around her and eventually just closed in on her from a bunch of different ways. It was also showing how everybody had an angle and something they were trying to get from it. Even with Bradley, who feels she is trying to do the right thing and seek social justice, there is also an ego part of her and a reporter part of her where when she’s talking to Hannah she’s not just talking to her as a human who has been through something traumatic. She’s pushing her because she wants to get the best story for a means to her end. So it’s really about how this woman, Hannah, got in the middle of all these people who needed something from her and wanted something from her, and wanted to manipulate her and pull her and stretch her in these different ways, and she wasn’t equipped to handle it. And, who could be?   Mitch remembers their night together as consensual. And yet what happened to her is — to borrow a phrase from your show — insidiously systemic in our culture and is an abuse of power. After the eighth episode, some people might have thought, “Well, she didn’t leave.” And it’s about so much more than that. Do you hope that by the end of the finale you will have shifted those perspectives? What dialogue do you hope to start?  I think they might start by saying that, but if they watch the whole season they will feel the truth of it. That was my hope and my goal. Because when a subject becomes such a hotbed topic and people take sides, then they are really reacting to it like a political thing and not as a human thing. And I really wanted people to connect to it like a human thing, and to experience it through this woman, this young woman, who really did not deserve that. If Mitch had treated her as a human being, it would not have happened. Imagine the story if Mitch was the guy who found her on the street and that they talked, they had a human connection and he cheered her up. They made each other feel better as comrades; they watched a movie and that was it. And then he saw her at work the next day and mentored her. It didn’t need to go where it did. And I think that’s what’s so tragic. It’s easy to choose not to do that — to choose to see people as human beings. The assault episode played out with the Harvey Weinstein story breaking in the background; Matt Lauer and Charlie Rose have also served as inspirations. How has Mitch been informed by the spectrum of men who have abused their power in the #MeToo era?    There’s a feeling that isn’t always what’s reported in press releases. People are saying “I’m sorry” and all this stuff publicly, but then these other attitudes seep through where they don’t think they did anything wrong, or where this person is making excuses. Anyone can make a million excuses as to why something did or did not happen in their own head. And I wanted to just look in the simplest form; to watch a human being go through this. She went up to his hotel room, she wanted to leave and he hit on her and she didn’t know how to leave. And you see how hurtful and wrong it is. Your heart kind of breaks when he does that, because I think there’s part of you that really wants to believe that he’s not the bad guy. There’s part of you that wants to think, “Oh, he is this guy that everybody loves. And maybe they got it wrong and maybe he didn’t do all this stuff.” And then when you actually see it happen, it breaks your heart. It breaks your heart for her, obviously, in the largest way. But it was such an avoidable incident. And it changed her life forever. That absolutely changed her life forever and that is tragic. That scene breaks my heart. In the final scene, Mitch seems to truly understand what he has done. Now that Mitch has been fully unmasked, how would you describe him?  Ultimately, he is kind of a monster. What I did not want to portray him as was an obvious monster. And I guess it gets into semantics of, what is a monster? Is a serial killer a monster? Is a monster someone who deliberately goes out and does something and knows in the front of their brain? Which degree of monster is he? Who can get into that and come out alive, honestly? But I think he is a damaged person who is narcissistic, who has not thought of people around him as human beings. He’s thought of them as people who, in a variety of ways, served his purposes. Is that a monster? That depends on your definition of a monster — but it’s definitely a shitty human being!   Hannah delivers powerful words when she confronts Mitch with her side of what happened and explains to Bradley how the trauma has affected her entire life. What research went into telling her story; did you work with Time’s Up or speak to sexual assault victims? We in the writers room have our own experiences and we also did research and talked to doctors. We mostly did research. I didn’t actually talk to a victim personally. We have all had experiences. You get inside the character and you write her psychology really carefully when you set her up about why she is a little fragile. She lost her mother really early, she doesn’t have family or a support system in New York. And that’s a lot of people, especially young people, when they’re starting their careers. They don’t have a family system nearby to support them and they are just out there. And I think that’s why they are targeted, because they’re needier. They have more to lose. It’s so sad. It’s hard to talk about. Do you have a predominantly female writers room? We have about half and half.  Can you talk about the conversations that you had in the room about Hannah killing herself. Did you consider not? Why did that need to happen to precipitate the ending? We did. We discussed it all around, up and down. It was always an instinct from the beginning to revolve a movement around the story of this victim, but in a way where the victim becomes a victim of it. That seemed to bring home the story in a way that was symbolically important to me, which is that these experiences alter people forever. And in a way, their old self does die. It hit home more, where the tragedy of it forces everyone who was circling her to take a step back and say, “Oh, what the fuck did I do?” And to get out of their own heads for a minute and think of the person at the center of it. To feel the loss of her and the tragedy of the loss, and the pointlessness of the loss. We tried to ground in that she definitely used drugs at work. She had hard hours, anxiety and emotional issues, which is remarkably common. It’s frighteningly common the amount of young people who overdose now from drug use. It’s really tragic and so much is connected to anxiety.    Hannah didn’t leave a note behind. Was her overdose on purpose? I actually don’t think it was on purpose. I think she was overwhelmed and I think she wanted to go to L.A. and get the fuck out. But I left it open because one ever knows. When people overdose, you really actually never know. That’s part of it. You don’t have the closure. You don’t get to know, because of this terrible thing that happened, was it a combination of things? Was it accidental? But definitely, she was driven to medicate herself because she was in so much emotional pain. She was terrified it was going to come out and that she was going to be painted in a certain way. She was mortified and she wanted to go self-medicate to stop having to feel it. Bradley (Witherspoon) blames herself. And Hannah’s death makes them all confront their own self-serving goals and complicity, including Alex (Aniston), Chip (Duplass) and, finally, Mitch. Where did they go wrong in pursuing this story?   That’s sort of the Catch-22 of it. Pursuing the story is 100 percent correct, because you want to expose everything. But then there are aspects of pursuing it, like the success of pursuing it or the personal motivations. People are very complicated and very fascinating. Altruism doesn’t really exist as pure altruism. It exists because it serves our egos on a certain level. So when you really break all of that down, there are no clean answers. I think yes, you should pursue these stories. You should try to get people to talk about it when they’re ready to talk about it, if they want to talk about it. But at the end of the day, it’s such a psychological web and the takeaway is that these are human beings; this is all very avoidable and to have the simplest human respect for another person. It’s been going on for a long time — this sexual conquest mentality. Alex admits she was on the wrong side of this until the end. How does her finale confession redeem her for her complicity? She takes a step toward redeeming herself. But one of the other things that was important in the story was for all of us to look at our behavior and our complicity, even when we didn’t know we were being complicit. There are things that go on in the world where you say, “Well, that doesn’t affect me and it’s not my business.” But then when it becomes an issue and you see it from the other side, it’s kind of horrifying. I’ve worked in this business a long time and I’ve seen many things. And to see them now from the perspective post-#MeToo is just very enlightening. I guess the message is just for people to think about what they’re doing and to try to be a fucking decent human being.  If season one is the reckoning of #MeToo, season two seems on course to reflect a world where wrongs could be righted. Alex and Bradley’s on-air takedown is something we haven’t seen in the real #MeToo era. Was some of that wish fulfillment and will that propel where season two is going? Definitely. For me, it was definitely wish fulfillment. That’s a huge, huge thing that they do and there obviously is going to be a lot of fallout and a lot of upheaval. I would say season two is a lot about transition. And still, at the same time, a lot of the same shit goes on! You set new rules, but then it falls back. This is true in the real world. Where it becomes: are we paying lip service to women’s rights? So it’s really just examining the transition period more but with the same themes of: What is real? And people having this desire to have control over their own lives, which they perceive as being through power.   They essentially drop a bomb on the network. For season two, are you now looking at how a network could survive this size scandal? Yes. It’s not simple. And also, just the timing of it now. The world of media is changing so rapidly and the story of a broadcast network in that universe is very interesting to me. Many people in the #MeToo era have been accused. Some go away, others mount comebacks; some get pushed out from the top and others go unpunished. Where will Fred fall? It plays into part of the second season, so I don’t want to say too much! But it definitely has a big effect on Fred. How will Alex and Bradley’s relationship continue to evolve? The interesting thing about Alex and Bradley is that they still barely know each other. They’ve known each other for like, three months of working together. If you work with someone for three months, you don’t know them super well. They’ve gone through two really traumatic experiences together, which has sort of forged their souls in a way. But they still don’t really know each other as people, so we’re playing some of that in the next season.    Cory Ellison (Crudup) has been a fan-favorite character. Will he play a big part in season two? Huge. Yes. I love him. I love that character and Billy is just a genius. He’s so much fun to work with and so smart and passionate and just committed. We both mutually adore that character.  Chip was revealed to be one who leaked the Mitch investigation to the New York Times. In terms of his silence and complicity, how much does that act of social justice redeem him? It does [set him on that path for season two], although the great thing about all of these characters is that they all have skeletons in their closets. Chip is going to be haunted by remembering that scene where he was standing outside the elevator and Mitch says, “Send Hannah.” And he knows he shouldn’t, but he does anyway. He will be haunted by that for the rest of his life. They do try, they have made good gestures, but you don’t just get to erase that kind of guilt and that’s part of the complication going forward. You get back into normal life and ambition, and then you have that haunting you. The very final scene of Mitch looking at the camera seems to be a man who finally realizes he is the monster he thought he wasn’t. Is this the last of Mitch or will he return for season two? We would like him to be back in season two. It’s in the works, but it’s not a done deal yet. That’s all I can say. But I would very much like him to be and I think that continuing that story is actually important. What would a continuation of his story look like, if he came back? Well, he’ll still be narcissistic because you don’t get to change that so easily. He’s still be the same guy, he’s just going to have more awareness that he is not a good guy. But people don’t change completely overnight, even in a tragedy. People are so wired; we have all our habits and neurosis wired into us so deeply that you fall into your old habits of denial or making excuses. But it’s still about that struggle now of actually knowing the truth — that he did very, very bad things. It’s not about a comeback. It’s about something else. Since you have already begun working on the second season, how would you sum it up so far?  It’s like a huge building fell on everybody and it’s about escaping from the wreckage.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston says the ‘world needs humor’ as younger set find ‘Friends’ offensive', 'content': \"Jennifer Aniston says “Friends” has become foe to a younger generation’s sensibilities. Aniston has been playing comedic roles since she stepped into Rachel Greene’s shoes on the 1994 mega-hit “Friends.” She quickly became a superstar, and in the decades since has been serving up the laughs in movies like the 2004 romantic comedy “Along Came Polly” and the 2013 romp “We’re the Millers,” in which she slayed as a stripper moonlighting as a soccer mom. Aniston, ahead of the release of her latest Netflix movie, “Murder Mystery 2,” spoke with AFP (via Yahoo News) about the evolution of comedy. MOVIES  March 22, 2023 “Now it’s a little tricky because you have to be very careful, which makes it really hard for comedians, because the beauty of comedy is that we make fun of ourselves, make fun of life,” Aniston said. “[In the past] you could joke about a bigot and have a laugh — that was hysterical. And it was about educating people on how ridiculous people were. And now we’re not allowed to do that.” “There’s a whole generation of people, kids, who are now going back to episodes of ‘Friends’ and find them offensive,” Aniston added. “There were things that were never intentional and others … well, we should have thought it through — but I don’t think there was a sensitivity like there is now.” “Friends” has been catching flack for years about its lack of diversity and the offensive nature of some of its jokes. TELEVISION  June 29, 2022 A once-obese Monica Geller (played by Courteney Cox) is the butt of body-shaming jokes throughout the series, and her brother Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) faces a barrage of homophobic punchlines because his ex-wife left him for a woman. Bustle published a list of offensive “Friends” jokes in 2018; Cosmopolitan published a list of “shocking” jokes in 2017 that “Friends” couldn’t “get away with today.” Series creator Marta Kauffman told the BBC in 2022 that she now regrets the representation of the character played by Kathleen Turner. “We kept referring to her as Chandler’s father, even though Chandler’s father was trans,” she said. “Pronouns were not yet something that I understood. So we didn’t refer to that character as she. That was a mistake.” ENTERTAINMENT & ARTS  Nov. 9, 2022 Kauffman also addressed the show’s lack of diversity. “I’ve learned a lot in the last 20 years,” Kauffman told The Times’ Greg Braxton in 2022. “Admitting and accepting guilt is not easy. It’s painful looking at yourself in the mirror. I’m embarrassed that I didn’t know better 25 years ago. “It was after what happened to George Floyd that I began to wrestle with my having bought into systemic racism in ways I was never aware of. That was really the moment that I began to examine the ways I had participated. I knew then I needed to course-correct.” Kauffman pledged $4 million to the Boston area’s Brandeis University to establish the Marta F. Kauffman ’78 Professorship in African and African American Studies, which supports “a distinguished scholar with a concentration in the study of the peoples and cultures of Africa and the African diaspora.” TELEVISION  Aug. 11, 2021 Lisa Kudrow, who played ditzy masseuse and coffee-shop singer Phoebe Buffay, also retrospectively weighed in on the series in 2020, commenting on how different the show would be if it were made today. “Oh, it’d be completely different,” Kudrow said. “It would not be an all-white cast ... I’m not sure what else, but, to me, it should be looked at as a time capsule, not for what they did wrong,” she said. “Also, this show thought it was very progressive. There was a guy whose wife discovered she was gay and pregnant, and they raised the child together? We had surrogacy too. It was, at the time, progressive.” Especially in the United States, where everyone is “far too divided,” we can’t “take ourselves too seriously,” Aniston told AFP. “Everybody needs funny!” she added. “The world needs humor!” Jan. 30, 2024 Jan. 16, 2024 Dec. 22, 2023 It's a date Get our L.A.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '', 'content': 'Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon are back as Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson. Apple TV+ has made significant strides in the race of streaming services content by offering a compelling lineup of original content and curating a diverse range of stories across different genres and themes. From Ted Lasso to Servant, the influx of positive reviews for their storytelling, performances, and production values is a much-deserved feat. One other known name that stands alongside those mentioned above is The Morning Show. Ever since it first premiered on Apple TV+, The Morning Show quickly became a fan favorite, and the second most-watched Apple TV+ series after Ted Lasso. The show offers a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of the anchors, producers, and staff of a fictional morning news program called \"The Morning Show.\" The series explores the aftermath of a scandal that rocks the show when one of its co-anchors, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), is fired due to sexual misconduct allegations. This event triggers a chain reaction of events, including Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) fighting to retain her job as a top news anchor, and the introduction of an impulsive field reporter, Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon). The Morning Show delves into the power struggles, personal ambitions, and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters as they navigate the world of morning television. It takes viewers on a rollercoaster ride as it tackles various themes, including workplace dynamics, gender politics, media ethics, and the #MeToo movement; offering a nuanced portrayal of the challenges faced by women in the media industry and exploring the complex relationships between the characters as they grapple with their own personal and professional conflicts. Soon after the conclusion of Season 2, Apple TV+ announced the renewal news for Season 3, and with new casting announcements coming in, we can\\'t help but be excited, here is everything we know about the upcoming Season 3. Editor\\'s Note: This piece was updated on August 24. An inside look at the lives of the people who help America wake up in the morning, exploring the unique challenges faced by the team. Apple has announced that the two-episode premiere of The Morning Show Season 3 will be available to stream on September 13, 2023, almost two years after the Season 2 finale. Alongside the announcement, Apple also unveiled several images from the new season. The show\\'s first season premiered in November 2019 followed by Season 2 arriving two years later in September 2021. Three months later, in January 2022, the series\\' new showrunner Charlotte Stoudt confirmed that The Morning Show will be returning. In an official statement, Stoudt expressed her excitement about serving as the showrunner for the new season. “I’m excited to be joining forces with Apple TV Plus and The Morning Show. The cast, led by the phenomenal Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, are truly to die for. Kerry, Mimi and Michael, and the teams at Media Res, Hello Sunshine and Echo Films, have created an irresistible world that is equally delicious and provocative.” Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+, said in a statement regarding the renewal. “It has been thrilling to watch The Morning Show go from strength to strength over the past two seasons, exploring topical storylines that have resonated with audiences around the world while also being incredibly addictive and entertaining. We’re excited to see where Charlotte takes these extraordinary characters in season three and to watch the magic that Jennifer, Reese and our awe-inspiring cast continue to bring to the captivating world of morning television.” RELATED:\\n11 Essential Reese Witherspoon Performances, From ‘Legally Blonde’ To ‘Big Little Lies’ Apple TV+ continues to be the streaming home for The Morning Show, with all seasons available exclusively on the platform. Apple TV+ offers a compelling subscription plan, starting at $6.99 per month, which is considered one of the best deals in the streaming industry. New subscribers are even offered a free seven-day trial before committing to the subscription. Those who opt to continue their membership after the trial period have the option to pay $69.99 annually, saving 15% compared to the monthly plan. Apple TV released a teaser trailer for Season 3 of The Morning Show on July 27, 2023. The preview runs at only around a minute long and teases what could be the most intense season yet as tensions grow between Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson. Apple TV released the full trailer for The Morning Show Season 3 on August 24, 2023, revealing some of the shocking twists and turns that the new episodes are sure to bring, including UBA\\'s headquarters becoming the target of a cyber-attack. We also received our first bit of footage of the new season in a sizzle reel released by Apple TV+ on May 30, which also highlighted new and/or upcoming titles such as the Tom Holland series The Crowded Room and the Brie Larson series Lessons in Chemistry as well as new seasons of The Afterparty and Foundation. In the upcoming season, viewers can expect to reunite with a familiar ensemble of talented actors. Alongside Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon in the role of Alex Levy and Bradley Jackson, the following main cast members will likely make their return: Billy Crudup as Cory Ellison, Mark Duplass as Charlie Black (aka Chip), Nestor Carbonell as Yanko Flores, Karen Pittman as Mia Jordan, Desean Terry as Daniel Henderson, Julianna Margulies as Laura Peterson, Greta Lee as Stella Bak, and Ruairi O\\'Connor as Ty Fitzgerald. One cast member who won\\'t be returning is Steve Carell, whose character Mitch Kessler was killed off last season. While the majority of the core cast is expected to reprise their roles, there will also be fresh additions to the morning crew. Apple TV+ has officially announced that Jon Hamm will join the series in the new installment. The Man Men actor will portray a character named Paul Marks who is \"a corporate titan who sets his sights on UBA, pulling Cory, Alex, and Bradley into his powerful orbit.\" The introduction of new characters will most likely bring about an intriguing dynamic to the narrative as the characters’ intentions and influences intertwine with the existing cast. Other new cast members on this season of The Morning Show include series regular Nicole Beharie (Miss Juneteenth) as Christina Hunter, a new anchor, and recurring roles from Tig Notaro (Army of the Dead) as Paul Mark\\'s chief of staff Amanda Robinson, Stephen Fry (Wilde) as UBA board member Leonard Cromwell, Natalie Morales (Dead to Me) as Kate Danton, Clive Standen (Vikings) as Andre Ford, Alano Miller (Dexter: New Blood) as Marcus Hunter, and Lindsay Duncan (Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)) as Martha Ellison. RELATED:\\n\\'The Morning Show\\': Showrunner Explains Why They Killed Off A Major Character Season 2 of The Morning Show concluded with a series of dramatic events that significantly impacted the characters\\' lives. There were numerous developments from Alex contracting COVID-19 and delivering an on-air rant to Daniel leaving the show and Cory\\'s streaming service launch failing. Notably, Cory confessed his love for Bradley, adding further complexity to the storyline. As Season 3 unfolds, viewers can expect to witness Bradley\\'s emotional journey in response to Cory\\'s admission, and the aftermath of Alex\\'s profanity-filled broadcast. The official synopsis for The Morning Show Season 3 via Apple reads: In season three of “The Morning Show,” the stakes are high as the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom. Kerry Ehrin, who served as the showrunner for previous seasons, and has transitioned into a consulting role for Season 3 had previously provided some hints about what viewers might expect. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Ehrin suggested the possibility of a time jump between Seasons 2 and 3 instead of directly picking up where the story left off. Ehrin expressed her lack of interest in exploring the COVID-19 pandemic, which concluded Season 2. She mentioned the potential for a leap into a later time, stating, \"You could [jump into the future].\" This approach would allow the narrative to move beyond the immediate aftermath of the previous season. Ehrin acknowledged the flexibility of the show\\'s unique universe, emphasizing that it can be situated in any period. She specifically mentioned wanting to delve deeper into the journeys of Bradley and Laura; additionally, hinting at the potentially expanded role of Paola Lambruschini, portrayed by Valeria Golino. Paola played a significant part in the narrative as the woman who interviewed Mitch before his death and brought crucial footage to America. Ehrin\\'s mention suggests that viewers can anticipate more involvement and development of Paola\\'s character in the upcoming season. In an interview with Collider\\'s Steve Weintraub for her most recent movie, Murder Mystery 2, Aniston hinted at what we can expect from the new season. \"Nothing\\'s funny about Morning Show . I\\'m kidding. There\\'s a lot of romance this year, and [there are] a lot of secrets that will be revealed.\" In another interview, Aniston also hinted at Alex\\'s journey in Season 3: “I think it’s time to see Alex find some love and some passion. She could put the controls down and go into the vulnerability of opening up her heart, which I don’t think she’s ever really quite done.” Aniston also hinted that the new season might also dip even deeper into Alex\\'s personal life, before her days on the show: “What are those parents like? What did they do? What was her life 20 years ago like? How does someone become this motivated person that wants to be relevant at all costs? I’d like to see some history.” While promoting her film Your Place or Mine, Witherspoon teased Bradley\\'s interesting new dynamic with Cory. “I think they have a certain trust. I think some things might have happened. I almost don’t know too, I always ask the writer, ‘Has something happened [between them]?’ and she’s like, ‘Hmmm something might have happened.’\" Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston serve as executive producers much like the earlier seasons, while Mimi Leder takes on the role of director and executive producer. Overseeing the show\\'s creative direction as the showrunner and executive producer is Charlotte Stoudt. The production of The Morning Show is a collaborative effort between Media Res, Hello Sunshine, and Echo Films, with Kerry Ehrin, Michael Ellenberg, Kristin Hahn, and Lauren Neustadter also serving as executive producers. No, the filming for Season 3 started in August 2022 and concluded on February 9, as confirmed by Jennifer Aniston and Mark Duplass through their Instagram posts. However, post-production work is likely underway, requiring some additional time for editing and final touches. Much like the previous two seasons, Season 3 of The Morning Show will run for 10-hour-long episodes. Yes. Apple TV+ has already given the green light for a fourth season of The Morning Show, even before the third season has premiered, showing their confidence in the show\\'s success. But scheduling Season 4 may present some difficulties with concerns regarding the contracts of Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, as their agreements were set to conclude at the end of Season 3. Regardless, discussions are underway, and it is anticipated that both actresses will likely sign new contracts, potentially encompassing an option for Season 5. These negotiations demonstrate the intention to keep the show\\'s core cast intact and pave the way for future seasons of this compelling series.

Over the course of the Apple TV+ drama’s latest 10 episodes, viewers were blessed to behold Jon Hamm in his juiciest dramatic role since Mad Men, Nicole Beharie outshining her movie star castmates with a standout performance, a stomach-churning scene that felt ripped from Succession, a Meghan Markle dress sighting, a hot Hamptons sex scene, more terrifying 2020 flashbacks, and Billy Crudup stealing scenes left and right. The Morning Show‘s Season 3 finale delivered one of the most unexpected endings in 2023 TV, so fans of the spicy series are likely left wondering if and when The Morning Show Season 4 is coming. Curious if Apple TV+ renewed The Morning Show for Season 4? When The Morning Show Season 4 premiere date is? Or what’s in store for the future of UBA? Here’s everything we know about the future of The Morning Show. Great news UBA fans, The Morning Show is returning for Season 4 on Apple TV+, which means there’s more delicious drama, scandals, and star-studded episodes to come. Apple announced the series was renewed for another season in April 2023, months ahead of the show’s Season 3 debut. So when can we expect more of the juicy Apple TV+ drama? Here’s everything we know. Like so many other forthcoming television series and movies, The Morning Show‘s Season 4 premiere date ultimately depends on the resolution of the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. As of November 8, 2023 (aka Season 3 finale day), The Morning Show Season 4 has no set premiere day, but past premiere dates can give us some insight into when Season 4 might arrive. The Morning Show Season 1 debuted in November 2019, Season 2 premiered in September 2021, and Season 3 dropped in September 2023. It’s clear Apple TV+ values The Morning Show as part of its fall slate, so it’s likely we won’t see the series return until Fall 2024 the earliest. But since there’s been a two-year gap between seasons, there’s also a chance we could see Season 4 in Fall 2025. Here’s hoping Alex Lexy (Jennifer Aniston) and Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) return to us ASAP, and we’ll be sure to update this article with any new information. If you’re looking for a detailed episode recap of The Morning Show‘s Season 3 finale Decider has you covered. But the main takeaway from Season 3, Episode 10, “The Overview Effect,” is that Bradley turned herself in to the FBI for her role in covering up her brother Hal’s (Joe Tippett) involvement in the January 6 insurrection. And Alex destroyed her billionaire ex Paul Marks’ UBA deal, and with help from NBN anchor Laura Peterson (Julianna Margulies). Instead of being bought and sold for parts by Marks, UBA and NBN will now merge, which brings us to potential Season 4 storylines… Wondering if Reese Witherspoon is returning for The Morning Show Season 4 after Bradley’s unexpected Season 3 resolution? As Decider’s Meghan O’Keefe wrote in her Ending Explained article, “Maybe Bradley will get off early for good behavior in time for Season 4 or maybe there will be a big time jump. Perhaps we’ll get a whole storyline about Bradley’s time in the slammer or maybe, just maybe, Witherspoon is out, y’all!” As for future Morning Show Season 4 storylines, there’s an opportunity to focus on UBA and NBN’s merger, and see what the future holds in store for Alex, Chris (Nicole Beharie), Cory (Billy Crudup), Chip (Mark Duplass), Mia (Karen Pittman), Stella (Greta Lee), Yanko (Nestor), and Laura. “I think mergers are always messy, whether they’re personal or corporate. So, it’s always fun to play with that. Whether that story is the story is a question we’re wrestling with right now. There are all sorts of things to talk about,” showrunner Charlotte Stoudt told Deadline in an interview. “We’re also trying to reflect the world…how many streamers can there be? People getting laid off, that sort of stuff. So we also just want to reflect what’s actually happening in the media world. Some people are doing very well, some people are doing less well. It’s like the Wild West.” If NBN moves front and center, perhaps we’ll also see more of Elena (Elizabeth Perkins) and June Diane Raphael and Mindy Kaling’s characters. Oh, and we’ll learn if this is really the end of Jon Hamm’s run on the Apple TV+ drama. Like I said, we need more Morning Show ASAP.

Things are heating up on The Morning Show. Once the flagship Apple TV+ series loosely based on the Matt Lauer Good Morning America scandal, The Morning Show has quickly evolved into something more. Season Three ushers in new challenges for co-hosts Alex (Jennifer Anniston) and Bradley (Reese Witherspoon), following the show\\'s tackling of #MeToo and the Covid-19 pandemic. This season began with some major drama, after the news station was hit by a mysterious cyberattack. As with any data leak, hidden secrets about the show come to light, and Alex and Bradley get caught in the mayhem. Judging by the trailer for the new season, there seems to be some Succession-esque plotting underway—with a new character (played by Jon Hamm) interested in purchasing the news network. \"We are flirting with financial disaster,\" CEO Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) tells Alex in the trailer. \"We need someone with more money than God.\" In this week\\'s episode, “White Noise,” an important contract negotiation becomes public and divides the station. The leaked information causes The Morning Show\\'s employees to form unlikely alliances. Amidst the chaos, Chris, a new and scrappy journalist, gets her big break.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '11 Ways to Style Leather Pants, Jackets, Skirts and More, According To a Pro Stylist', 'content': '                                                                All the easy ways to incorporate the trending fabric into your wardrobe for less When it comes to a fabric that is versatile, looks luxe and is flattering on everyone, leather ranks at the top of the list. And while the classic textile has been used to create clothing for decades, it’s made a huge resurgence in recent years. But if you haven’t worn leather in a while and are hesitant to try it, don’t fret! Gone are the days when leather was only on tight, form-fitting garments, as it’s now found on roomy wide leg pants and shirt-like jackets. Need more convincing? We turned to creative fashion designer and stylist Catherine Bibeau for all her tips on how to style leather pants and other leather items so you’re left looking and feeling your best. Read on for all of the reasons why you should add leather to your wardrobe. For one, leather is extremely versatile. It can be dressed up or down, look edgy or feminine, come fitted or loose and is offered in a wide range of colors. For example, throwing on a leather trench can instantly elevate any ensemble, or opting a leather moto jacket can make a fancier dress look more casual.  Leather is also very flattering because of its ability to hug curves in all the right places, showing off the figure. And it also adds texture and dimension to an ensemble. “It is a chic piece that adds shine to any outfit,” says Bibeau, which creates a more interesting ensemble. Best of all, the fabric is typically very durable and can last you years. “Leather has historic durability and versatility,” attests Bibeau. “It became a classic piece to wear every day, even at work.” And even though some real leather pieces can seem pricey up front, it’s a good investment to consider because of the amount of wear you will get from the item. If you’re not willing to commit to real leather, faux leather options run the gamut and are equally as durable as the real thing. Leather pairs well with many different fabrics and materials, but whatever you pair it with, Bibeau says to make sure it’s something chic. “A nice pair of pants, a nice skirt or a dress,” all work great with leather items, she says. For a more casual outfit, try mixing denim with leather. A short leather moto jacket paired with your favorite pair of high-rise jeans balances the body and highlights your best assets. Or, take a colored pair of leather pants and throw on a jean jacket as the finishing touch. The contrast of fabrics make it visually interesting to the eye and play off each other perfectly. No matter what you decide to wear with leather, it’s best to steer clear of anything too bulky or thick, says Bibeau. “Always keep the under layer simple and keep the accent on the beauty of the jacket [or other leather item] itself,” she says. This will ensure the leather garment “fits like a glove.” One example of this is how “leather pairs well with a silk blouse or a flowing silk dress as it gives it structure, while thicker materials under your leather jacket only creates a puffy and unflattering look.” Lastly, Bibeau advises letting the leather piece have its moment and be the main star of the show. “The best advice is to go simple with leather and keep the focus of your outfit on the beauty of what leather brings on its own.” Keep scrolling to get some inspiration from celebrities 40 and older who showcase how easy it can be to pull off leather. From leather pants to jackets, skirts and shorts — there’s a piece for everyone. And best of all, we found similar styles to shop that won’t break the bank. We all love a tried-and-true pair of black pants like Andie MacDowell is rocking above. A style that flatters all body types? A high-waisted pair with a relaxed or “mom” fit (think mom jeans). This design is looser through the hips and thighs but fitted in the waist, showcasing an hourglass shape. And pleats along the front waistline add extra flair and flatter. And wearing with a striped button down and white heels brightens up the look while still appearing polished. Shop the look: Pink and white striped button down: Buy from Express, $17.45 Black high waisted leather pants: Buy from ella james, $60 White pumps: Buy from Amazon, $49.99 Black leather not for you? Not to fear, brown leather is here! If you find you look best in the warmer hue, there are plenty of brown leather pants on the market to choose from. Brown is great for a daytime look, as it typically looks less dressy than black. Just take inspiration from Tatyana Ali (above) who paired her brown leather pants with a tan sweater vest and simple white button down for an effortlessly chic ensemble. Shop the look: Light tan sweater vest: Buy from Nordstrom, $38.35 Cropped camel leather pants: Buy from Saks Fifth Avenue, $69.99 White button down shirt: Buy from Land’s End, $59.96 You can never go wrong with wearing various shades of one color, and this green outfit, as seen on Christie Brinkley above, proves just that. A pair of skinny leather pants in a darker green hue help carve out curves in an instant. And to balance out form-fitting leather pants, choose a top with a looser fit and tuck it into the pants. What’s more, a pair of neutral tan booties in a suede fabric keeps the eye scanning vertically to elongate the body. Shop the look: Chartreuse long sleeve top: Buy from Garnet Hill, $44 Dark green leather pants: Buy from Chico’s, $24.98 Tan suede booties: Buy from Amazon, $55.99 If you really want to play with different textures, try out leather pants that have an embossed animal print, like alligator or snake skin. Celine Dion (above) is proof at how the added texture on pants that have a slight flare at the ends create more interest to the look than typical black leather pants. And keeping the rest of the look in coordinating colors with a black turtleneck and black and gold tweed jacket Shop the look: Brown and black tweed jacket: Buy from Saks Off Fifth, $59.99 Black alligator print leather pants: Buy from Aritzia, $49.99 Black turtleneck long sleeve: Buy from Amazon, $17.99 As Bibeau mentioned previously, leather pants are a great option to wear for work. For a safe bet, choose a pair that isn’t super form-fitting (more straight leg or wide leg) and add a simple blouse and plain black pumps a la Katie Holmes above. Not only is this a work-appropriate ensemble, but it’s also trendy and looks more stunning than standard. Shop the look: White frilly blouse: Buy from Lulus, $24.50 Burnt orange leather pants: Buy from Selfie Leslie, $69.99 Black heels: Buy from Amazon, $19.21 A tie-belt leather jacket not only keeps you warm all day as a stylish extra layer, but the belt creates shape to the figure. This is a great way to ensure the leather topper doesn’t look boxy. And opting for one in a gorgeous green shade, like Kylie Minogue has on above, it pops against an all black outfit. Shop the look: Black sheath dress: Buy from Express, $52.80 Green Faux Leather Tie Jacket: Buy from Nordstrom Rack, $34.97 Black shaping sheer tights: Buy from Spanx, $28 One of the most populars ways to wear leather, aside from leather pants, is in a moto jacket varaition. The edgy piece is a staple item to add to your wardrobe, as it goes with essentially anything. It works well to dress down a nice dress, elevate a simple tee and jeans or take a look from day to night instantly. These jackets also come in a variety of colors, like the widely-loved burgundy shade as seen on Mary J. Blige above. And matching the jacket to a dress and bag not only creates a cohesive look but also makes the body appear instantly more statuesque. Shop the look: Burgundy midi dress: Buy from Artizia, $50.99 Burgundy leather moto jacket: Buy from Saks Off Fifth, $59.99 Brown and burgundy handbag: Buy from Michael Kors, $179 Like mentioned earlier, Bibeau loves the look of a good pair of jeans with leather. The contrast of fabrics is ultra-flattering to the eye, and truly so versatile. Take your favorite jeans and add a belted leather shacket (we love the pale yellow hue Garcelle Beauvais has on above!), and you have a chic look in seconds. Finish it off with a pair of fun and spunky heels, like these zebra print heels below. Straight leg jeans: Buy from Zara, $45.90 Pale yellow leather shacket: Buy from NA-KD, $48.96 Zebra print heels: Buy from Amazon, $53.40 The fun doesn’t stop at pants and jackets! Leather skirts and dresses are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to flatter essentially everyone. Leather gives a chic twist to a classic dress or skirt style, and is especially great for a nighttime look, such as a happy hour or girl’s night out. And a monochromatic look, like Courteney Cox is wearing above, with a coordinating turtleneck is slimming while dark slingback heels visually stretch the frame for a tall and trim silhouette over all. Related: 7 Midi Skirt Outfits For Every Occasion From Errand-Running to Cocktail-Sipping Shop the look: Blue long sleeve turtleneck: Buy from Amazon, $15.99 Blue leather midi skirt: Buy from Amazon, $36.99 Black slingback kitten heels: Buy from DSW, $59.99 Aside from black, red is up there as one of the most popular colors to wear when sporting leather. Because leather is typically seen as more “edgy” or “bold,” it makes sense that it’s often found in an edgy and bold color! Red is a classic shade that complements many skin tones and adds a bit of fiery flair to your ensemble. To make a big statement, take a nod from Priyanka Chopra Jonas, shown above, who wore an all-red look with a pair of snakeskin heels for added pizzazz. Shop the look: Red wrap blouse: Buy from Amazon, $46.99 Red leather midi skirt: Buy from Amazon, $29.99 Snake skin print slingback kitten heels: Buy from Kohl’s, $62.99 Jennifer Aniston as shown above, looks gorgeous in this leather mini dress. But if you prefer a bit more coverage, this look could also easily be recreated with high-rise leather shorts and a matching leather top. This is a great option for the warmer months when going out for dinner and drinks or even a concert. It will keep you cool and show off a tasteful amount of skin. To finish the look off, slip on a pair of embellished black heels. Shop the look: Black high-waisted faux leather shorts: Buy from Amazon, $19.99 High-neck faux leather top: Buy from Micas, $22 Black rhinestone studded heels: Buy from Amazon, $34.99 First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.

This episode saw Christina's (Nicole Beharie) controversial social media post dominating headlines and news cycles but also, the photo of Paul (Jon Hamm) and Alex (Jennifer Aniston) kissing went viral. And although the previous episode very much left us feeling as though the chips in the UBA deal were falling into place, this episode delivered a surprise twist: Paul wanting to start an entirely new media company. So, could UBA really have a future after all? The final two episodes will reveal whether that really is the case.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Stream queens: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon on their TV reunion and how The Morning Show changed after #MeToo', 'content': 'Dawn of a new era: Inside fall\\'s most anticipated series and the launch of AppleTV+  The Morning Show — which marks Aniston\\'s major return to TV after Friends ended in 2004, and the pair\\'s first project together since Witherspoon guest-starred on the NBC comedy as Rachel\\'s spoiled little sister Jill in 2000 — takes viewers inside the world of daybreak news. \"There\\'s something sort of bulletproof about morning shows,\" Witherspoon says. \"They\\'re a stalwart part of American culture.\" After all, every day millions of Americans wake up and turn on the Today show, or any number of other programs, and are greeted by familiar faces they trust to deliver the news with just the right amount of personality. At least that\\'s the expectation. As you brew your morning coffee, they update you on the latest from the White House. As you pick out your clothes for the day, they let you know how the weather is looking. And as you prepare to head out the door, they amuse you with fun anecdotes about the internet\\'s buzziest viral video. \"These shows are some of the last programming in the country that still tries to appeal in Los Angeles and New York and Des Moines and Mississippi,\" says Morning Show executive producer Michael Ellenberg. \"You have to introduce an idea of what America is that works for blue states and red states.\" It was Ellenberg who brought the idea for The Morning Show to Witherspoon, whom he worked with on Big Little Lies, and Aniston in late 2016. (\"I said to him, \\'I\\'m not completely closed down to television because it\\'s been pretty good,\\'\" Aniston recalls.) He can trace the idea back to 1989, when he saw Jane Pauley get replaced on Today. (It\\'s widely believed to be because she was \"too old.\" She was 39 at the time.) Then in 2012, Today\\'s veteran newsreader Ann Curry was reportedly driven off the program after less than a year as a cohost, a subject explored in journalist Brian Stelter\\'s 2013 book Top of the Morning, which Ellenberg quickly optioned. (Stelter is a consulting producer on the show, which uses his book mostly for background research.) \"These are some of the most powerful women in America, and we watched them get screwed publicly, basically,\" Ellenberg says. Witherspoon adds: \"I was astounded by how honest a lot of female anchors were with myself and Jen. I think most people would find it shocking that women in that position, of what we perceive as power, are looked at as expendable.\" With Aniston, 50, and Witherspoon, 43, on board to star and executive-produce the series, it wasn\\'t hard to find The Morning Show a home. By August 2017, they\\'d met with Apple. Did we mention that Apple creates TV shows now? In March 2019, the tech powerhouse announced it was entering the streaming world. (Hey, all the cool kids are doing it!) Joining the relative elders — Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video — as well as the new class of streamers — HBO Max, Disney+, Facebook Watch, Snap Originals, Quibi, and too many more to count — Apple is launching Apple TV+, a service so shrouded in secrecy you\\'d think it was the nuclear codes…or the next iPhone. For instance, ahead of Tuesday\\'s 2019 keynote, Apple wouldn\\'t even confirm how much it will cost. (But the Apple execs do have jokes, promising to reveal how much it will cost if only a reporter would hand over her credit-card info.) One thing that\\'s always been known is that The Morning Show would be a part of Apple TV+\\'s initial slate of programming. \"It was day 2 or 3 of us being here at Apple when we heard the pitch,\" says Jamie Erlicht, who is head of worldwide video for Apple alongside Zack Van Amburg. (Both came over from Sony Pictures Television.) \"It was so undeniable, both in the story they wanted to tell and who was involved. We left the meeting and we literally didn\\'t even know how to order paper clips for the office — let alone a TV series — but we said we had to have it.\" Fifteen minutes later, they called to make an offer. And, it seems, the enthusiasm was mutual. \"The more ambitious this project was, the more I felt like Apple was the right place for it, because they were taking a shot too,\" Witherspoon says. \"They\\'re putting themselves out there to get into the content world.\" (It also probably didn\\'t hurt that Apple agreed to pick up the series for two 10-episode seasons before they\\'d filmed anything.) But the show Apple was originally pitched isn\\'t exactly what made it to the screen. \"We started developing it in August, and by November, the whole world had changed,\" says Witherspoon. Specifically, #MeToo happened. On Oct. 5, 2017, The New York Times published a piece in which Ashley Judd, among others, accused film mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment. On Oct. 15, Alyssa Milano invited other women to speak out by tweeting \"me too,\" a movement originated by Tarana Burke in 2006. And by the end of November, accusations had come out about Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., and even Today\\'s Matt Lauer. On Nov. 29, NBC fired their cohost of two decades following allegations of sexual misconduct. \"When #MeToo happened…it\\'s like, we can\\'t not address it,\" Aniston says, with Witherspoon adding, \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen a time in my life where more people have lost their entire careers over misconduct. People who were seemingly untouchable. We had to start totally over and redevelop the show, but it actually turned out to be so much more potent and topical.\" Part of that redevelopment process involved a showrunner swap. In April 2018, Kerry Ehrin replaced House of Cards\\' Jay Carson, who\\'d previously been attached to the project. \"We realized that the story that was unfolding was not the story we all wanted to tell,\" says Erlicht. \"So we regrouped with the exec-producing team and we realized that, as fantastic as Jay is, we just saw a different vision for this particular show, and that\\'s where Kerry came into the picture.\" Ehrin, who\\'d written for Friday Night Lights and Parenthood and co-created Bates Motel, came to the series ready to tackle the #MeToo of it all as well as tell a story through a female lens. \"I love Broadcast News and I love Network, so it feels like an area where you can have a lot of humor but you can also get at some real subjects,\" Ehrin says. \"I\\'ve been a woman in a very high-stakes business for 30 years and I\\'ve seen all kinds of stuff. I wanted to write complicated female characters that weren\\'t perfect and that weren\\'t bitches.\" Those complicated female characters include Aniston as longtime Morning Show cohost Alex Levy and Witherspoon — sporting brown hair and a Southern accent — as West Virginia local news reporter Bradley Jackson. Levy is a seasoned anchor. A well-oiled machine. She wakes up every morning at 3:30, works out, grabs her Red Bull and coffee, and prepares to give America whatever it needs that day. Jackson is a bit of a hothead. She\\'s dangerously passionate about the truth, and from time to time that passion gets her in trouble. (She\\'s nicknamed \"Two F—s\" Jackson from a moment she let the F-bomb slip on air…twice.) But neither woman is prepared for what their lives are about to become when the series begins. In the show\\'s pilot, the sun\\'s not even up in New York City when s— hits the fan: After 15 years of cohosting alongside Alex Levy, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) has been fired following allegations of sexual misconduct. And it\\'s Levy who has to go on camera and address the nation, just mere hours after finding out the news herself. Sound familiar? \"[Matt Lauer] won\\'t think this has anything to do with him,\" Aniston says sarcastically. And although Ehrin would like to remind everyone that The Morning Show is a work of fiction, \"this is the world we live in right now and it\\'s impossible to ignore it.\" If there\\'s one thing this show doesn\\'t do, it\\'s ignore it. \"People don\\'t look the other way anymore,\" director and executive producer Mimi Leder says. \"We put a microscope right up to who these people are.\" That includes the accused, Mitch, who, like Carell himself, is a man America has fallen in love with, and is one of the last men they want to see accused of something bad. As Aniston puts it, \"No one else could play that part. There\\'s nothing you could find about Steve in a closet.\" And for Carell, the man best known for playing hilariously incompetent boss Michael Scott on The Office for six years, it was a chance to play a guy who refuses to take a long, hard look in the mirror. \"Mitch is a very flawed human being and someone with enormous personal blind spots,\" Carell says. But Mitch\\'s firing is just the beginning of the most in-depth exploration of #MeToo scripted television has seen thus far. What happens to the accuser? What happens to the accused? How are loved ones affected? \"Sometimes the world is so confusing that the only way that you can understand it is through art,\" Witherspoon says. \"We don\\'t take sides in any of it. It\\'s about the humanity of these issues.\" As for Witherspoon\\'s Bradley, she finds herself in Alex\\'s orbit when a video of her arguing with a coal-mine protester goes viral and the Morning Show producers bring her on for an interview. We can\\'t quite get into where the two women go from there, but with everything that\\'s going on, Bradley is not Alex\\'s biggest concern. Because not only has Alex lost her partner, but her contract is up for renegotiation with the network — led by slippery man-in-charge Cory Ellison (played to perfection by Billy Crudup) — and let\\'s just say that she\\'s older than Jane Pauley was in 1989. As Alex tells her teenage daughter in episode 3: \"Sometimes women can\\'t ask for control, so they have to take it.\" Back in Los Angeles, just hours before Witherspoon will get lost in her memory of Diane Sawyer\\'s set visit, Aniston is sitting poolside at her sleek hilltop home, holding a bottle of Smartwater like the dedicated spokeswoman she is. Her blue eyes still sparkle the same way they did when she first walked onto the Friends soundstage. But by now, they\\'ve seen some things. \"This role never could\\'ve come to me any sooner than now,\" she says. \"It\\'s one of the hardest jobs I\\'ve had. I knew I was up to the task, but then there was the excavation of all the emotions in order to create this world for this woman. All of her lifelines are falling away. I would walk out of some of those scenes feeling like a manhole cover just came off my back.\" Because, much in the way that America feels like it knows Alex Levy within the world of The Morning Show, America feels like it knows Jennifer Aniston in real life. \"I understand that, with people having connections to Friends,\" Aniston says. \"I understand the isolation — not wanting to be seen, not wanting to be public, not wanting to have to go on a red carpet. It\\'s not always easy to go out there and have to be the person that you have to be.\" But when the lights come on and the cameras are pointed at you, you just figure it out.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '', 'content': '        If there’s one thing you click on this morning, let it be Jennifer Aniston and Jon Hamm’s sex scene from Morning Wars. For those who have been anticipating a Don Draper resurgence in all his deliciously ‘tall, dark and handsome’ glory, Hamm delivered that in spades in the latest episode of the Apple TV+ drama. This season saw Aniston once again return to her role as news anchor Alex Levy, who along with the ensemble cast including Reese Witherspoon and Billy Crudup, are thrown into uncertain waters when tech titan, Paul Marks, takes an interest in UBA. With Hamm portraying the billionaire, the showrunners have been building up to an explosion between the two characters, though we hadn’t expected their tryst to be as risqué as what was presented. The sixth episode of the third season, entitled “The Standford Student”, realised the Mad Men x Friends cross-over we didn’t realise we had. With Hamm’s suave energy playing against Aniston’s own seductive tact, the result was something incredibly naughty but oh-so watchable. Though, for our readers joining us from their mobile devices at work or industry-issued monitors, we must warn you that the contents of the scene are entirely NSFW. In the scene, Hamm and Aniston’s characters share a steamy kiss before moving to the bedroom for a goosebump-inducing ménage à trois. (The third party? That’s us, the can’t-look-away viewers.) Of course, for the actors who got their respective big breaks in successful TV franchises set in New York, it’s only natural that this steamy sex scene occurs in the Hamptons. A move Rachel Green would’ve certainly approved of. The interest netizens have taken in this moment has catapulted the scene up there with some of the greatest on-screen displays of passion. Some have even described the event as the contemporary equivalent of Ross and Rachel. Though we wouldn’t go that far, we would highly suggest you cancel tonight’s plans, set up your Apple TV+ subscription (if you haven’t already) and call your girlfriends over for an evening of wine and Hamm. (Jon, that is). This is one scene you won’t want to miss. THE MORNING WARS SEASON 3, STARING JENNIFER ANISTON & REESE WITHERSPOON, IS NOW STREAMING ON APPLE TV+.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '14 Rare Photos of Jennifer Aniston Early In Her Career', 'content': \"The star almost wasn’t on Friends! Name a ‘90s actress more iconic than Jennifer Aniston, we’ll wait. The beloved Hollywood star, who got her start on the hit sitcom Friends, has been gracing film and TV screens and setting style and beauty trends (remember “the Rachel” haircut craze?) for decades. Although Aniston is now a household name, once upon a time, she was a New York City drama student with big dreams. From her early role in the Ferris Bueller television show (yes, this was a thing) to almost not getting the part of Rachel, we take a look at some of Aniston’s early career highlights. Aniston, who graduated from New York’s LaGuardia High School of Music & Performing Arts (aka the Fame school) in 1987, poses for a portrait in the ‘80s. One of Aniston’s earliest roles was on the Ferris Bueller's Day Off television series—which got canned after only one season. Here she’s seen sitting beside her co-stars Charlie Schlatter, Brandon Douglas, and Ami Dolenz, during a promotional shoot for the show. Aniston briefly dated her Ferris Bueller co-star, Schlatter, during the early ‘90s. The two were photographed out on a date at Spago, Wolfgang Puck’s celeb-loved Beverly Hills restaurant. Besides Ferris Bueller, Aniston also appeared in the TV movie Camp Cucamonga and seven episodes of Molloy, a comedy series that also starred Mayim Bialik. In 1992, the young actress had her first-ever movie role in Leprechaun, a horror-comedy fantasy flick. During a 2021 video interview with InStyle, Aniston shared that she was afraid the film would negatively affect her acting career. A year later, she acted in an episode of Burke’s Law, a television series that aired on CBS. In 1994, Aniston starred in yet another short-lived sitcom, Muddling Through, as Madeline Drego, the daughter of Stephanie Hodge's character Connie Drego, an ex-convict who returns to her family. Later that year, Aniston landed the role of a lifetime as Rachel Green in the television series Friends. However, Aniston almost didn’t star in the iconic show. During an interview on SiriusXM's Gayle King in the House, Aniston shared that her other series during the time, Muddling Through, was set to be renewed for a few more episodes. After hearing this, the Friends producers started auditioning other actresses as a backup. Aniston was catapulted to superstardom after Friends began airing in 1994 due to the excellent dynamics that she and the whole ensemble cast shared right off the bat. Here, she’s pictured attending one of NBC’s press tour parties in 1995. The actress appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 1995 to promote Friends. The musical guest that night was James Ingram. Aniston and her Friends co-star, David Schwimmer, attended the Hollywood premiere of Before Sunrise amid their Friends fame. The movie, which was a buzzy mid-’90s romance drama directed by Richard Linklater, stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Aniston attended the 21st Annual People’s Choice Awards in Universal City with her Friends co-stars. The group won the Favorite New Television Comedy Series award that night. A year later, Aniston starred in Picture Perfect along with Kevin Bacon. Here, she’s pictured between scenes during a location shoot in New York City with her then-boyfriend, Tate Donovan. Aniston also went to the 1996 Golden Globe Awards with her Friends co-stars, and looks fabulous alongside Lisa Kudrow. The show was nominated for Best Musical/Comedy Series, but lost to Cybill.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston Is a Great Actor. The Morning Show Proves It.', 'content': ' “Guess what?” Jennifer Aniston declares to a table full of overbearing, arrogant network execs in the third episode of The Morning Show, “America loves me. And therefore I own America.” She’s not wrong. Her character, Alex Levy, is a longtime morning-show host and a darling of viewers: As the beloved face of the program, Levy leverages that adoration to get precisely what she wants, even as a phalanx of blue suits tries to put her out to pasture. Sitting at the head of that long mahogany slab, wearing a jumpsuit and matching cocoon coat as crimson as a Revolutionary War uniform, Aniston might just as well be talking about herself. America loves Jennifer Aniston. And therefore Jennifer Aniston owns America. I know an inordinate amount of information about Jen (what her friends call her!). She used to have a beloved dog, Norman, a Welsh corgi-terrier mix; after he died a few years back she had his name tattooed on her foot. When Aniston was married to Brad Pitt, they claimed their favorite thing to do together was stay in and order Mexican food, but dammit if she wasn’t at Mr. Chow a few nights a week. She’s godmother to Courteney Cox’s daughter, Coco. She still wears belts with her jeans, like all the time, those thick, solid chestnut-colored ones. Chris McMillan, the stylist who manufactured the infamous Rachel do, still cuts her hair. If she weren’t an actress, Aniston would have been an interior designer; check Architectural Digest for the receipts on that one. Is it weird, how much I know? That I didn’t have to Google a single thing in that paragraph? That if competing in an Aniston-centric trivia night, I’d put my odds at knowing every single answer at, quite honestly, 100 percent? I don’t follow her obsessively, dig into fan sites, or hunt for information about her on TMZ. I read cover stories about her in major women’s glossies; I watch occasionally when she’s on Jimmy Fallon or pops up in Reese Witherspoon’s Instagram. Like most of you, I’ve seen all of Friends and about half her movies. And yet her habits and poses and wardrobe and lovers have burrowed so deeply into my brain that “Jen Aniston” is a topic I can confidently discuss for hours. Every lamely assembled cover story about Aniston will attest to the same things, in the same order. They usually open with her greeting the writer with a hug in one of her “zen” but “palatial” homes, with a wide, glowing view overlooking L.A. — a domestic metaphor so heavy it might wallop you off her balcony. Then comes the reminder that Aniston is toned and golden and the sun bounces off her Aveeno-smoothed skin like it’s the heat shield on a space vessel reentering Earth’s orbit. Last is the bit about Aniston as America’s Sweetheart, a retracing of all the other cover stories that came before this one, that each also traced out the story we know so well, of the romantic tragedy that she has bravely risen out of like a phoenix from the ashes, or some other graceful animal from any other type of wreckage. Every story about Jen Aniston is still one of “triumph” over “disappointment.” Once a year, you can count on reading this piece in a big, fancy glossy. Enter Alex Levy in The Morning Show, the closest Aniston may ever come to playing a pastiche of her own career and celebrity. It’s a role that a slew of Hollywood A-listers could have handled, but only Aniston can really embody. Levy hosts the most popular morning show in the industry, a faux Good Morning America with the Today show’s penchant for scandals. Publicly, she’s the pretty but aging face of morning news — there’s a spectacular scene in which Aniston grimaces in the mirror and pulls her facial skin taut, momentarily restoring her 1990s visage — but internally, network execs yank her around, refusing to renew her contract and dictating exactly how she ought to sit, stand, and speak on camera. It calls to mind how, in September, Aniston told the New York Times that she’s far from a stranger to sexist behavior in the industry, listing unnamed examples: “Agents, studios, finding out what this actor made versus that actor made.” Despite her spot on the top of the heap, Aniston — along with A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie — has, it seems, been scuttled along behind closed doors just as much as anyone. Levy, like Aniston, lives in a glass box way up in the sky, privileged beyond compare, geographically cloistered. (Though in the character’s case, it’s in Manhattan.) Levy has been forced to keep her separation from her husband secret to avoid tabloid scrutiny; Aniston wrote in 2016 that she and then-husband Justin Theroux were “harassed by dozens of aggressive photographers staked outside our home who will go to shocking lengths to obtain any kind of photo,” and there are memorable photos of Aniston and Pitt walking a beach just as news came out that they were separating. As Aniston rose to fame in the late ’90s and early aughts, the film roles she took on matched the public’s perception of Rachel Green: almost all lead girlfriends or rom-com damsels in movies like She’s the One, The Object of My Affection, Picture Perfect, and Along Came Polly. The essence of Levy’s job isn’t to deliver the hard-hitting news, just as nobody wanted Kramer v. Kramer out of Aniston for most of her career. Instead, both Levy and Aniston are expected to be the nicest women in America, with the most smiley face, and the longest limbs, and not a whit of exasperation for the madhouse that is their lives. In an era of constant reinvention, Aniston has stayed refreshingly the same. That long, golden blonde hair. Simple, tailored clothes, almost always black for formal events, with the occasional metallic mini thrown in, or a red dress not dissimilar to Alex’s strapless number. Aveeno moisturizer, apparently. Her post-Pitt, post-Friends roles were, largely, a career extension of that sameness — more rom-coms like Rumor Has It and He’s Just Not That Into You. People want to see Aniston be harmlessly funny, and so she mostly tries. But it’s worth noting that Aniston is the most famous actress in the world who has never headlined an undoubted critical and box-office hit. Yet the times she’s broken out of the approachable-but-gorgeous-funny-lady roles have been, by far, the most fruitful of her career. There was The Good Girl, where she played a laconic store clerk who mooned around onscreen, and then Nicole Holofcener’s 2006 Friends With Money, where she played a pothead maid whose three best friends (Joan Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Frances McDormand) all, well, have plenty of money. It was a languid role cast perfectly against type, with Aniston the unexpected slacker to three other far less famous actresses’ successes. Then, in what is undoubtedly her best performance, she played Cake’s Claire Bennett, an opioid-addicted, grieving mother. Claire shuffles down her house’s lonely hallways and launches into wild rages, every bit of glamour stripped from her scarred and pockmarked face. When Aniston gives up on funny and reaches into darkness — perhaps accessing that tender region every cover story so laboriously irons onto her — she digs up deep wells of frustration and we can suddenly empathize with her beyond the role of lovelorn dumpee. If women adore Jennifer Aniston because on some level they relate to her romantic history, in Cake she proves herself an empathetic figure for the deepest levels of woe. But her roles in movies like Cake are almost beside the point: Aniston stays A-list famous for steadily remaining a sweetheart, for always showing up in the fitted Yves Saint Laurent tux or straight column gown, for good-naturedly letting the reporters into all of her hillside manses and giving them a very small piece of that heart that everyone (admit it) wants to be broken. There’s a strange discord between her persona and her best work, as if she’s played the golden girl so long that she simply can’t shake that role. That is, until The Morning Show.  The series revolves around the firing of Alex’s longtime on-air partner, Mitch (played delightfully in a variety of volumes by Steve Carell), after he’s accused of “inappropriate sexual conduct,” which he claims, repeatedly, was consensual. Network execs bring in West Virginia reporter Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon, with an appalling southern accent) for an on-air interview and then offer her a job, taunting Alex with the presence of a younger, fresher rival. Before Mitch’s rapid fall from grace, Alex was shuffling along — interviewing presidents, yes, but also handling the small, inane segments of morning shows that are meant to keep people chuckling as they pack school lunches or iron a shift dress. Mitch’s departure and Bradley’s arrival galvanize Alex like a bucket of cold water to the face. She steps out of a fog and drops the smile. She still has the adoration of the country, and she knows it, which turns her into a force. Stymied in her contract negotiations and her demand for co-host approval, Alex glides onstage at an industry awards show and sweetly announces Bradley as her Morning Show co-anchor — without consulting or warning the execs who are trying to pin her down. That night, called to explain herself in front of the network suits, is when she stares them down along that mahogany table and announces that from now on, she’ll be running things. Aniston has played a whirlwind before (ahem, Along Came Polly), but with The Morning Show there are stakes, which makes all the difference. She deploys all the best bits of her comedic training when she’s playing Levy backstage — the faces she makes while she’s stuck on a speakerphone chat, a forceful yank of her extensions when she’s off-air, a cell-phone-smashing bit that nearly careens into a Three Stooges routine — but zips herself up into a controlled glide the second she steps on set. Alex Levy seemingly gets no special joy from sitting Plasticine-like in front of the camera and offering the world what it wants from her. Aniston flicks that on-off switch like a pro, not just because she knows what it’s like to live in front of cameras, but because she knows what it’s like to live as a persona — the ray of sunshine, the good girl, the woman who causes no trouble. It’s the knowingness behind Aniston’s performance that lends it such weight: Some moments feel so personal, like that face-pulling moment, that it’s almost as if camera operators just waited for her to forget they were there. There is no zany “check out my chops” hand theater here, though the role is more physical and comedic than you might expect. (Aniston and Mark Duplass, who plays Alex’s executive producer, toss alternately exasperated and questioning faces back and forth that pivot from dueling to knowing in rapid succession.) She slides on a pair of glasses so firmly that I wonder if she’s been watching old tapes of Cronkite. As Levy, Aniston puts on a veneer of graciousness that fictional viewers of “The Morning Show” within The Morning Show would view as genuine, but we can see as an act. Every tic of her face is calculated to consider who is watching her, and whether she needs that person to adore her or fear her. This is Jennifer Aniston knowing and performing Alex Levy’s fame, just as she, in turn, performs her own fame. In the fourth episode, Bradley utterly implodes while trying to “introduce herself to America,” accidentally spilling the beans on air that she had an abortion when she was a teenager. Alex knowingly nods, trapped between panic and professionalism. Aniston turns on a simpering voice, “Thank you, for opening up, Bradley,” but the second the cameras cut out, her voice drops an octave and she demands, “Did you fuck up just now, or was that intentional?” — more mob boss than spot of morning sunshine. Both Aniston and Levy have a perfect sense of when and how to use their power. The next morning, Alex picks up Bradley in her SUV to drive her back to the studio, to “get back on that horse.” When Bradley moans about the job, Alex replies, “All jobs are fucked up. You do things you don’t necessarily choose to do in exchange for relevance and money, and you cannot let it kill you.” In that moment it’s hard to know if it’s the actress or the character talking. There’s a thrill in Aniston that translates onto the screen in The Morning Show, like she’s finally taking a leap into unlikability and it feels better than she expected. Perhaps it’s the joy of playing a member of the media, that industry that has so gleefully earned dollar after dollar off her tragic divorces and invented pregnancies and sculpted biceps. Or of simply upending expectations by jumping into the Me Too fray with a prestige drama. But really, it feels like she’s laughing. Here is Jen Aniston, back on TV after 15 years away, playing a woman who knows exactly what it feels like to be watched and judged and considered too old or too silly to do the real, heavy work. A woman who peers down at the city from her penthouse and climbs daily into chauffeured black SUVs and has a hive of makeup artists brushing over the merest glimmer of shine, lest anyone see the imperfection. Here is Aniston, back on the medium that launched her career, this time telling the America’s sweetheart inside herself to fuck off. “I can guarantee that you are underestimating me,” Levy tells that long table of men, “and I am really fucking over people doing that.” Aniston might as well have written the line herself.

We\\'ve been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process. As evidenced by \"The Rachel\" haircut phenomenon, people have taken beauty cues from Jennifer Aniston for decades. The Morning Show star has influenced fans yet again when she revealed the affordable way she preps for her onscreen persona as Alex Levy. Back in 2021, the 54-year-old actress shared a photo of her \"dream team\" on set, comprising makeup artist, Angela Levin, and hairstylist, Chris McMillan. The vanity pictured also held a stock of beauty products like the Dr. Hauschka Lip Care Stick ($15). Jennifer\\'s recommendation comes just in time for impending cold weather. Lip care is crucial for protecting against chapping and flaking. Dr. Hauschka considers itself a step up from traditional lip balms, crediting ingredients like rose hip oil and shea butter for leaving lips with a soft, supple feel. It seems like shoppers on Amazon agree, contributing to its 4.7-star rating. \"On one of the coldest, driest nights in Paris with my dehydrated, parched lips, as I walked into a pharmacy seeking help, they recommended this to me,\" a reviewer wrote online. \"No unpleasant, waxy, medicinal taste, smell or coating. Totally different from others.\" Another added: \"I don\\'t write many reviews, but I need you to know that this lip care stick is worth every penny. For winter chapped, sunburned or just dry lips, this stuff is seriously miraculous.\" Other products featured as part of the Friends star\\'s beauty routine included Tatcha\\'s The Serum Stick, which she\\'s heralded as her dewy complexion secret. While we couldn\\'t spot her haircare products, no doubt she\\'s achieving her signature wavy tresses with a little help from her beauty brand LolaVie. Sitting down for a British Vogue exclusive in June to chat about her health and fitness regimen, the star also took the time to address back-handed language like \"you look great for your age\" that often revolves around older women in Hollywood. \"It drives me bananas, I can’t stand it,\" she told the interviewer. \"That’s a habit of society that we have these markers like, \\'Well, you\\'re at that stage, so for your age\\' ... I don’t even understand what it means.\" Jennifer continued: \"I\\'m in better shape than I was in my 20s. I feel better in mind, body and spirit.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston’s post-workout secret: Do compression leggings work?', 'content': '   No drain, no gain, according to Jennifer Aniston. Aniston, 54, recently shared Instagram images of her post-workout regimen featuring some bizarre pants that look like a NASA laboratory creation. It turns out Aniston was rocking Body Ballancer compression pants, designed to reduce swelling by using pressure to drain fluid from the lymphatic system (part of the immune system). These and other types of compression leggings have been around for a few years and promise to control cellulite, support weight loss, improve digestion and boost the functioning of the immune system. That’s a lot to promise. But do these compression leggings, which run from $10,650 to $18,800, actually work, or are they just another pricey Hollywood gimmick? First, a bit about lymphatic drainage massage: It also has been around for years and is a medical technique used to relieve painful swelling in arms and legs caused when bodily tissues retain a clear, watery fluid called lymph. Lymph is filtered by the lymph nodes located in the armpits, groin, neck and other areas, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Some doctors recommend lymphatic drainage massage to people recovering from breast cancer surgery or who have rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia or other conditions that cause pain and swelling. And it’s possible that lymphatic drainage massage might benefit some people: A 2021 study reported that “there is some evidence that … in early stages following breast cancer surgery [lymphatic drainage massage] may help.” However, most clinical studies have found little or no evidence that the technique can enhance the overall functioning of the lymphatic system or relieve the pain from lymphatic swelling. For physical recovery after exercise, some athletes use compression garments like leggings or arm sleeves, but even for them, there isn’t a lot of evidence supporting their effectiveness. A 2017 meta-analysis in the journal Sports Medicine examined 23 studies of compression garments and concluded that “[t]he benefits of compression garments in relation to applied pressures and participant training status are unclear and limited by the paucity of reported data.” So much for science: What do everyday users say about compression leggings? Despite the lack of evidence supporting their use, there are some rave reviews online. “This lazy-girl-approved activewear trend is basically a dream come true,” said Mia Maguire in the Daily Beast. “In my opinion, everyone who is active, travels a lot, and or is on their feet or sitting all day [which basically describes everyone] should wear them,” physical therapist Chad Beauchamp told Byrdie. “Stagnation (a k a sitting at your work desk for hours at a time) causes the lymphatic system to not work efficiently and fluid can be retained in the lower extremities. Compression pants can help aid in draining,” Beauchamp added. The Body Ballancer might be called an extreme type of compression garment: It’s a zip-up suit that covers the lower body, or a jacket for the upper body. The garments are attached through thick cables to an electronic device that pumps air into the garment, making them press against the body. “The bodysuit was like getting a very strong hug,” one user told “Good Morning America.” The suits, developed in the UK in 2018, are now primarily found in spas and aesthetic salons. NYC facialist Teresa Tarmey previously offered Ballancer Pro treatments for $250 a pop at her practice, as seen in a 2018 “Good Morning America” video, but it’s unclear if it’s still available. But as far as reducing cellulite, flushing out toxins, helping with weight loss and sleep disorders, improving digestion or enhancing immunity, there isn’t any real-world evidence to support those extravagant claims. A search for “Body Ballancer” on PubMed — an online repository for medical research — yielded zero results, and the company’s website offers no medical evidence to back up its claims. When asked for more information, a Body Ballancer representative told The Post: “I’m afraid to say there are no scientific studies that have been carried out into the aesthetic benefits of the Body Ballancer.” Even Hollywood health experts cast doubt on the overblown benefits of lymphatic drainage. “If you have a healthy lymphatic system, lymphatic drainage massage isn’t likely to benefit you beyond simple relaxation,” stated a report from Cedars-Sinai, a medical research center based in Los Angeles. “And despite celebrities claiming that lymphatic drainage massage makes them ‘red-carpet ready,’ there’s no evidence that lymphatic drainage massage can help you slim down,” the report added. “Instead, using lymphatic drainage techniques may have a temporary trimming effect because it helps move fluid through the body.”                     ', 'source_domain': 'nypost.com', 'url': 'https://nypost.com/2023/09/11/do-jennifer-anistons-compression-leggings-work/', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': \"Jennifer Aniston’s Net Worth In 2024: Here's How 'The Morning Show' Actress Made Her Millions\", 'content': 'The third season is about to drop! Women\\'s Health may earn commission from the links on this page, but we only feature products we believe in. Why Trust Us? If there\\'s one thing in this world I know to be true, it\\'s that Jennifer Aniston is a cultural icon. With a career in show business that spans four decades, she\\'s become a household name (and heartthrob) for millions of people. Of course, the 54-year-old isn\\'t resting on her laurels. She\\'s still out there crushing it in Hollywood and at home, with a hit TV show, a haircare line, and a partnership with buzzy fitness brand Pvolve. Speaking of work, The Morning Show is coming back for a third season on September 13—and Jennifer is once again starring as morning show host Alex Levy. So, it’s only natural to have questions about the actress\\'s massive bank account, and where it stands now after forty years in showbiz. So, what is Jennifer Aniston\\'s net worth and how’d she rake it all in? Here’s a look back. Jennifer was born in Sherman Oaks, Calif., to actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, but her family relocated to NYC when she was a child, according to IMDB. She told Allure last year that she moved to Los Angeles in 1989 to try and jump-start her acting career. Jennifer even shared a little bit of what it was like trying to find her spotlight in Hollywood. “I walked into a party in Laurel Canyon. This girl says, ‘Come with us. We’re doing a circle.’ I was like, ‘What’s a circle?’ It was all women and they saged you before you went in,” Jennifer said. “Then a talking stick, I’m sure with feathers on it. The women call in the four directions, and I’m like, ‘What the fuck is going on? Am I in a cult?’ Hours later, woman after woman, just speaking, sharing thoughts and fears, worries. How incredible women are for each other. That’s how I got into that world, which I guess would be called Woo Woo. It was very Woo Woo.” Jennifer’s big break came in 1994 when she landed the role of Rachel Green in Friends. The show took off, and the cast members later made headlines when they banded together to demand higher salaries. “I’m aware that I have had a pretty easy time in terms of my experience in the business,” she on The Radio Times, per The Evening Standard. “But even back on Friends, it wasn’t so much about women being paid the same as men—some of the women were being paid more.” Jennifer said that the negotiations were more about the fact that, “\\'We’re doing equal work and we all deserve to be compensated in the same way.’ I wouldn’t feel good going to work knowing someone was getting x amount and I was getting something greater.” During the 2003 and 2004 seasons of Friends, Jennifer Aniston and her co-stars earned $1 million each per episode, according to Celebrity Net Worth. She also reportedly gets a 2 percent cut of the share of $1 billion royalties Friends earns each year. After Friends, Jennifer moved on to movies—and that was a smart move because she’s been in a ton of box office hits. Here’s a brief list, per IMDB: Apparently, Jen took home $5 million for her role in We\\'re the Millers, and $8 million for Marley and Me, according to The Hollywood Reporter and E!. And while it\\'s not totally clear what her paychecks looked like for her other film roles, securing a big name like Jennifer Aniston probably cost production companies quite a bit of money. The Morning Show, which co-stars Reese Witherspoon, is an award-winning show that debuted in 2019. Jennifer was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award in 2020 for her role playing anchor Alex Levy. The series is on its third season, and she now makes $2 million an episode (yes, per episode!), according to The Hollywood Reporter. Massive paycheck aside, it looks like Jen and Reese have the *best* time on set together, which is honestly priceless. Jennifer also has her hand in a bunch of products and brands, including: In fact, Jen is such a Pvolve fan that she frequently posts on Instagram about her workouts. The actress also used to be a spokesperson and co-owner for Living Proof haircare products, and now has her own line of vegan, cruelty-free hair products called LolaVie. Jennifer’s gotta do something with all that cash. Her real estate portfolio includes a home in Montecito, California, where she lives near Prince Harry and Meghan Markle; a Beverly Hills mansion; and a Bel Air mansion, according to Architectural Digest. Her Montecito manse is apparently a \"Mediterranean-style\" home that used to be owned by Oprah Winfrey. But it\\'s hardly the first fabulous property Jennifer has owned. When she and Brad Pitt got married in 2001, they lived in a $13.1 million Beverly Hills home, where they added a tennis court and guest house, per AD. They sold it for $28 million in the divorce, and Jen moved into a $13.5 million mansion (still in Beverly Hills) in 2006. Eventually, she sold that one too, for $38 million, the outlet reported. In 2011, Jennifer spent $7.01 million on two West Village condos in Manhattan that included a penthouse with a wraparound terrace, AD said. She sold it a short time later for $6.5 million in 2012. TBH, Jennifer seems to just interior design. “If I wasn’t an actress, I’d want to be a designer,” she AD during a tour of one of her homes.. “I love the process. There’s something about picking out fabrics and finishes that feeds my soul.” Thanks to her early success in Friends and her hustle in Hollywood, Jennifer is now worth a cool $320 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. While she\\'s not as wealthy as Jennifer Lopez or her ex-hubby Brad Pitt (who are both worth $400 million), she is definitely killing it in the money department. And since Jennifer is still raking in Friends royalties, you best bet she will be living comfortably for a loooooong time. While that all sinks in, you can find me catching up on The Morning Show\\'s second season before the new one drops tomorrow.

Turns out Jen and Charlie met on the 1990 Ferris Bueller’s Day Off show (excuse me while I watch that immediately), and then in 2014, GQ’s editor-in-chief Jim Nelson casually announced that he witnessed their “brief, torrid” relationship when he was a writer’s assistant on said show. To quote: Welp, this quote is all kinds of gross and sleazy, so moving on! Paul and Jen were rumored to be an item sometime in their early careers, but honestly, the internet wasn’t really a thing back then and no one was keeping up with Paul Rudd’s romantic life, so the details are murky at best. Jennifer did, however, admit that she and Paul were “together when we were, like, 12.” JenAn and Daniel dated for more than four years, which is a lifetime in celebrity relationships—which is why I find it truly wild that I have no memory of this ever happening! But apparently, Jennifer was smitten because she opened up about her relationship with the late actor to the New York Times in 2015 (via Entertainment Tonight), saying, “He was my first love—five years we were together. He would have been the one. But I was 25, and I was stupid. He must have sent me Justin [Theroux] to make up for it all.” Jennifer and Counting Crows’ Adam Duritz dated for approximately two seconds before he went on to date her BFF and Friends costar Courteney Cox. Of their brief fling, Adam told Vice TV’s Dark Side of the ’90s: He went on to claim that he’d “never seen” Friends (sure, bud) and “honestly had no idea who she was.” Gonna go ahead and say this is when Adam Duritz peaked, even though he doesn’t seem to realize that. Jennifer and Tate dated for a couple of years, and then (awkward) he ended up getting a role on Friends (Joshua!) right as they were breaking up IRL. He told Us Weekly, “It was just six episodes. I mean, only because we were breaking up. We were like, ‘Hey, can we not keep doing this? ’Cause this is really painful and tough.’” Jennifer and Brad started dating in 1998 after being set up by their agents. Jen gushed to Diane Sawyer: “It was weird.…That was a really easy evening. That was really fun.” They got married in Malibu a few years later but split up amid rumors that Brad was cheating with Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Photos eventually came out of Brad and Angie hanging out on the beach, pretty much confirming rumors of their new relationship, and Jennifer eventually spoke out about the pics in a 2006 Vanity Fair interview, saying: Anyway, it was super messy for a while there, but Brad and Jen appear to be on amazing terms these days and were even hanging out a bit before the pandemic, prompting speculation that they were reuniting. Vince was Jennifer’s next serious relationship, but they didn’t last long, splitting in 2006. Jennifer opened up about the breakup to Vogue, saying, “I call Vince my defibrillator. He literally brought me back to life. My first gasp of air was a big laugh! It was great. I love him. He’s a bull in a china shop. He was lovely and fun and perfect for the time we had together. And I needed that. And it sort of ran its course.” These two were kinda on and off from 2008 to 2009, and then John inexplicably held a press conference outside his gym to announce their eventual split. In 2010, he chatted about the experience to Rolling Stone, saying, “I’ve never really gotten over it. It was one of the worst times of my life.” More recently, John has been spotted lurking on Jen’s Insta. By which I mean…he Liked this photo in 2020 and the internet lost it: Justin and Jen started dating after filming Wanderlust together and got married in 2015. But they split up in 2018—although everything was super amicable and they’re still close friends. Earlier this year, Justin told Esquire, “I would say we’ve remained friends. We don’t talk every day, but we call each other. We FaceTime. We text. Like it or not, we didn’t have that dramatic split, and we love each other. I’m sincere when I say that I cherish our friendship. We can not be together and still bring each other joy and friendship. Also, she makes me laugh very, very hard. She’s a hilarious person. It would be a loss if we weren’t in contact, for me personally. And I’d like to think the same for her.” Jen and David dealt with fast and furious dating rumors recently thanks to a source telling Closer that after the Friends reunion, “it became clear that reminiscing over the past had stirred up feelings for both of them and that chemistry they’d always had to bury was still there. They began texting immediately after filming and, just last month, David flew from his home in New York to see Jen in L.A.” If that sounds like fan fiction, it’s ’cause it is! Celebrity gossip account @Deuxmoi shut down the story, while David’s rep told the Huffington Post UK that the rumors about him and Jen are simply not true. It’s unclear who Jennifer is dating now, if anyone, but naturally she wants to keep it private, so on that note, BYE!

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston hosts star-studded holiday party for the ‘old guard of Hollywood’', 'content': ' Jennifer Aniston hosted a rather secretive holiday party for a gaggle of her equally famous friends this past weekend, Page Six can exclusively reveal. The star-studded soirée took place at the actress’ sprawling Bel-Air mansion on Saturday night, and we’re told the “joke of the night” was that the group considered themselves the “old guard of Hollywood.” After all, attendees included Sandra Bullock, Gwyneth Paltrow, David Spade, Bradley Cooper, Jason Bateman and Tobey Maguire. Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos and IAC chairperson Barry Diller were also in attendance, as were several of Aniston’s colleagues — past, present and future. “Friends” stars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow — as well as “Morning Show” stars Reese Witherspoon and Mark Duplass — were among those celebrating the festive affair. Jon Hamm — who will appear in Season 3 of the Apple TV+ drama series — was there with his new girlfriend and potential wife, Anna Osceola.  We’re told it was a no-cellphone party — but not because there was a rule in place. Guests simply “didn’t pull them out,” so people weren’t taking photos or videos, or documenting their nights for social media. The bash was described to us as an “old-school, fun party” filled with “non-thirsty” celebrities.  Though Aniston did not post about her high-society get-together, she did give her Instagram followers a glimpse at what her winter wonderland may have looked like. The weekend before the fête, the actress, 53, went shopping for her Christmas tree and picked up a wooden Rudolf in the process. “This was a terrible idea,” she admitted while filming Lord Chesterfield, her white lab, and Clyde, her Schnauzer mix, mistaking the decoration for a new dog toy. “Guys, be nice! He’s just here for the holidays! He’s just visiting!”                   ', 'source_domain': 'pagesix.com', 'url': 'https://pagesix.com/2022/12/13/jennifer-aniston-hosts-star-studded-holiday-party/', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston Salad', 'content': 'The Jennifer Aniston Salad is fresh, crunchy, and packed with plant-based protein. Enjoy this light, gluten free salad as a healthy lunch or dinner. This post may contain affiliate links.  Alternatively titled, “The One with the New Lunchtime Obsession.” I don’t know about you but anytime I hear the name “Jennifer Aniston” followed by pretty much anything else, I’m in. If it works for Jennifer Aniston, it works for me! That said, I recently stumbled upon a dish that Jen once described as her “perfect salad” and I couldn’t resist making it the very same day. Ding, ding, ding – we had a winner! The Jennifer Aniston Salad is fresh, crunchy, healthy, and packed with plant-based protein. I’ve been eating it on repeat as a light lunch and protein-filled snack after a challenging workout. Could this salad BE any more health goddess-esque?! If you’re a Friends television show fanatic then you probably know that Jennifer Aniston reports that she ate the same salad every day for 10 years with co-stars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow while filming the series. THIS salad is not THAT salad. The salad Jen ate on the set of Friends was a Cobb Salad, while this salad is a riff on a tabbouleh. She shared it years ago on Instagram with the caption “My perfect salad”, and was nice enough to also list the ingredients that were inside her bowl. Celebrities — they’re just like us! This recipe makes a TON of salad which is great because you can portion it out for easy lunches all week long. Simply mix everything up, including the dressing, then scoop into individual size storage containers, or wide-mouth mason jars with lids. Add any protein or additional lettuces on top then cover. Voila — instant, healthy lunches for the week! Personally I think this quinoa and chickpea salad is totally satisfying on its own, but feel free to pair it with additional protein / healthy fats. Here are some ideas: The Jennifer Aniston Salad has been SO well received by readers and what I love is that they’ve found ways to make it their own! Here are some ideas on how to put your own spin on this viral salad recipe: Fresh, crunchy, and healthy to boot, I hope you’ll give this gorgeous salad a try! Let’s get to it.  Step 1: Cook quinoa in chicken or vegetable stock. Bring chicken or vegetable stock to a boil in a small pot then add the dry quinoa, turn the heat down, and then cover and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the stock has been absorbed, about 15 minutes. Fluff the quinoa with a fork. The cooking process is very similar to cooking rice. You’ll know the quinoa is done when it “pops” into what look like tiny little springs. The texture is so great.  Scoop the quinoa into a storage dish or large bowl with a lid to cool before placing into the refrigerator to chill completely. Tip: I usually do this a day ahead of time so the chilled quinoa is ready to toss together with the other ingredients.  Step 2: Assemble. Once the quinoa is chilled, add all your goodies. We’ve got canned chickpeas that have been drained and rinsed, chopped pistachios, crumbled feta cheese, diced cucumber, and minced red onion.   Plus lots of chopped fresh herbs including parsley and mint. SO GOOD.  Step 3: Make the Lemon Dressing. Last step is to whisk up a simple Lemon Dressing to dress the salad with. To a small mixing bowl, or to a mason jar with a lid, add equal parts lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil, plus with a drizzle of honey, and pinches of salt and pepper. Whisk or shake to combine.  Step 4: Dress the salad.  Drizzle however much of the lemon dressing you’d like over the quinoa salad then toss to combine – you do NOT need to add all the dressing! Serve right away or stash in the refrigerator for later!  Store the dressed salad in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. You can store it in the big mixing bowl with a lid, or scoop into individual size storage containers. This salad also makes great mason jar salads! Scoop into wide-mouth mason jars then grab and go!

Michele 02.11.2024 I made this salad as a lunch prep for work. It is delicious. I love the dressing. I substituted olive oil with avocado oil and used crumbled goat cheese in place of feta. I also roasted my beans with some seasoning . It’s great, filling, refreshing salad. Whoever said salads are boring is only eating leaves.

Thanks so much. :) Kristin 01.05.2024 I’m so glad to hear it, Heather!!

Jennifer Aniston played Rachel Green on the hit 90s sitcom and has been a trendsetter since then. Even after so many years, her iconic hairstyle — popularly known as “The Rachel” — is still one of the most in-demand haircuts. Throughout her career, the actress kept on experimenting with her looks and styles, but what remained constant was her flawless skin. Jennifer Aniston has aged effortlessly, thanks to her strict skincare and fitness routine. The actress, even when on F.R.I.E.N.D.S., used to follow a very simple skincare routine. She has always believed in the concept of “less is more” and still follows this mantra. Apart from taking care of her skin, Jennifer also believes in taking care of her body. No matter where she is, the actress makes sure she does a little bit of exercise. Another key thing that she stresses is getting a good amount of sleep. Whenever she has talked about her skincare routine during interviews, Aniston has always talked about the importance of adequate sleep. Today, the actress is turning 54. Yes, we know it’s hard to believe but thanks to her age-old skincare hacks, Jennifer Aniston still looks gorgeous as ever. To celebrate this diva’s special day, we take a look at some of her well-kept skincare secrets that make Jennifer Aniston look so beautiful and enchanting. Age is just a number when it comes to Jennifer Aniston. Even at 54, she radiates happy vibes everywhere she goes, and her radiant skin is no exception. Her skincare routine is pretty simple, and Jennifer Aniston also believes in using very few products on her skin. With this, she has also been trying to change the narrative of anti-aging talk in the beauty world. “Very little offends me, but what I do think is becoming dated are things like, ‘Oh, you look great for your age. Because at a certain point, you should start to look like shit? Because that’s what that is implying. Like, ‘You should look like hell right now,'” she told Allure in a 2019 interview.     No matter at what time the actress wakes up, she makes sure to start her day with celery juice. This is followed by a diluted shot of apple cider vinegar to help lower her blood sugar and cholesterol. She then takes a shot of probiotics (which help in treating skin diseases like eczema, acne, and UV damage). She makes sure that she doesn’t start her day with coffee and has breakfast only half-hour after she is done with the routine. She also makes sure she mediates after her morning routine. BUY APPLE CIDER VINEGAR HERE Aniston has popularised the K.I.S.S. method which means to keep it simple. She also emphasises not overwashing the face. She revealed her “whole face regime is just soap and water” during an interview. Jennifer Aniston swears by using Aveeno daily moisturiser with SPF and that’s pretty much it. BUY AVEENO FACIAL MOISTURISER WITH SPF HERE Jennifer Aniston has the most effortless skincare routine. She uses Neutrogena Facial Cleansing Bar as a cleanser. She then applies toner to her face. This is followed by a few serums like Tatcha’s The Serum Stick, and a light anti-aging moisturiser like the Aveeno daily moisturiser. She exfoliates her skin three times a week. She uses a special handheld microcurrent device called ZIIP at home to lift and tone her face. She dabs her skin with SPF 50 every time she steps out. For her makeup, Jennifer only uses Clé de Peau Beauté concealer and lip balm to complete her look. Jennifer Aniston knows very well that hydration is key to good skin. She always carries water bottles around to ensure she remains hydrated throughout her busy workday. She also ensures she’s eating healthy and has a balanced diet. She ensures she avoids sugar as much as she can. It’s no secret that collagen is very good for the skin. Jennifer Aniston makes sure that this ingredient is also a part of her skincare routine. Collagen powder promotes healthy skin, hair, nails, and joints. The actress said she saw very evident differences in her skin and body after she started taking collagen powder. BUY COLLAGEN POWDER HERE All Images: Courtesy Jennifer Aniston/Instagram Cinema has always fascinated Ananya, so much that she got a degree in media to know more about it. She has worked for magazines like Man's World India and CineBlitz as an entertainment writer. When not writing about films and celebrities, she likes to travel to new places or try new cuisines.

However, many celebs have appearances and those are usually public. It makes a celebrity very uneasy when a fan gloats over them incessantly. If you have the chance, it is better begin a conversation about something totally irellevent and not about who they are. They will see you as grounded and normal. Remember, these people are no different than you and I other than they make more money and are recognizable to a large number of people. You might see if there is a public e    Every single time I see a picture of Jennifer Aniston I get the uncontrolable urge to go onto Ifooku. c o m and find me someone to mess around with under the covers. No other famous women does this to me but her. It is a weird thing, but she has some super human booby powers. Plus she is funny, goofy and sexy all at the same time. I did pass her on the street once in New York and just said a simple hello. She smiled and said hi back and away we went. I am not into making celebs uncomfortable even if I am obsessed with them.   Courtney Cox liked working with her. She was also the type of person who garnered much sympathy and outrage when Brad Pit left her for Angelina Jolie. I confess I was in her corner too. One: because Angelina seemed so jubilant about it. All her photo shoots with basically she and Brad acting like a married couple with children before they actually were. And it was very ill timed if you are in Jen's corner. And two: Brad was clearly a married man,seemingly happy. It seemed predatory to me. So, that's why I like Jen and not Angelina. And am in her corner. I used to work for a high end hotel and Jennifer Aniston stayed with us a few times. Once I was sent to check the internet in her room. She was really nice, asked a couple of questions, and then even said, “Thanks, honey,” as I was leaving the room, exactly like Rachel on Friends: In a very kind, sweet, but distant way. She stayed with us a few more times and was always the same: Relaxed, nice to staff and other guests. She is a real sweetheart. Edit: To answer the question: Interacting with her is like doing a cameo on a Friends episode.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'What Jennifer Aniston has said about the real scandal that inspired The Morning Show', 'content': ' It has been two very long years, but The Morning Show is finally back! The Jennifer Aniston- and Reese Witherspoon-led Apple TV series officially has a premiere date for its third season — and the latest trailer looks explosive. The on and off screen drama swarming fictional media company UBA\\'s signature morning news show will have fans on the edge of their seat come September 13, when the first two episodes of the ten-episode season debut. As hinted in the trailer, it appears the characters have finally emerged from the rubble Steve Carrell\\'s character left in the wake of his sexual misconduct scandal. Still, while the cast appears to have bigger problems in the cyber attack the trailer teases, the first two seasons\\' bombshells cast a huge shadow — as do the real life events that very clearly inspired it. When The Morning Show first debuted in 2019, its plot was undeniably reminiscent of the shocking, real life scandal that was Matt Lauer\\'s abrupt exit from his longtime position on the Today Show. In November of 2017, NBC announced that the former anchor\\'s tenure on the morning show had been terminated, following accusations that he sexually harassed a female employee during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. (None other than Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie announced the news of Matt\\'s departure live on air.)   Several other allegations, including those of rape and indecent exposure, followed, and were exposed in detail in Ronan Farrow\\'s explosive 2019 book, Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators. Matt\\'s self-inflicted downfall was, of course, just one of many high-profile cases of sexual misconduct brought about that fall amidst the #MeToo movement, which began with news of Harvey Weinstein\\'s widespread misconduct.

In fact, speaking with Variety, she confirmed the show\\'s script was completely reworked \"from scratch\" after Matt\\'s scandal, and the MeToo movement. She even admitted she watched the Today Show episode from the day before he was fired, and wondered: \"Did he know? Did he not know?\" \"I was so devastated,\" she recalled of hearing the news, adding: \"It\\'s such a strange thing; it felt oddly like my dad did something terrible. I trusted him and had been interviewed by him. He was there for so many moments in my life. And when Friends was ending, it was Katie [Couric] and Matt interviewing us.\" MORE: Reese Witherspoon supports Jennifer Aniston with sweet Instagram post However, she also maintained: \"Mitch Kessler [Steve\\'s character] is not based on him at all. He\\'s just sort of the archetype of all of the men that he\\'s representing.\" She noted the characters are \"all fictional,\" however said Steve\\'s does highlight the \"aspects of the archetype of a charming narcissist, of a generation of men that didn’t think that was bad behavior.\" Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S.  Sign up to our HELLO!

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'TV Review: Jennifer Aniston Dazzles In the Frustrating Yet Eminently Watchable The Morning Show', 'content': \"Apple's star-studded series is highly effective as a watchable, soapy drama The Pitch: Alex Levy’s (Jennifer Aniston) alarm goes off one morning at 3:30 a.m., her usual time. She goes through her routine—Red Bull while making coffee, under-eye patches and a jade roller, hair maintenance, pack bag, put the wedding ring back on, and out the door to her driver. But this morning, her phone won’t stop ringing. She doesn’t answer—avoidance, irritation, apathy, or some cocktail of the three keeps pushing her to ignore what’s obviously urgent. She pulls up outside the studio of her glossy, ratings-dominant morning show, and the caller (Mark Duplass) stands on the sidewalk. He’s got bad news: Her cohost of 15 years, Mitch Kessler, a cuddly mom-friendly teddy bear of a man (Steve Carell), has been fired for sexual misconduct. Then it all, as they say, goes sideways. Around the time Alex goes on the air, things are also getting pretty nuts for Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), a charismatic correspondent for a West Virginia news station. While attempting to cover a protest at a coal mine, a counter-protester throws off her cameraman, leading to an altercation between Jackson and the assailant—one that’s caught on camera, and quickly goes viral. That moment in the spotlight grabs the attention of network bigwig Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup), who tosses Bradley into the middle of the network’s storm. It’s chaos, but as Ellison says in one of The Morning Show’s bewildering early episodes, “Chaos is the new cocaine.”  The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Look, Movie Stars! Apple proudly describes its service as “all originals”; you’ll find no Golden Girls or Happy Days here. The company is betting you’ll cough up for their new service and these new series all the same, and it’s safe to assume much of their confidence comes from the fact that they locked down Aniston, Witherspoon, Carell, Crudup, and Duplass—only five members of an almost uniformly excellent ensemble cast, but five (the first three in particular) who happen to have major name recognition and loads of star power. Seeing bona fide movie stars in series regular roles on television is no longer a total rarity—this isn’t even Witherspoon’s first this season—but their presence indicates a certain level of prestige and promises loads of charisma, if nothing else. Luckily, it’s not just charisma. Though the contradictory, tonally inconsistent scripting (more on that later) makes for some moments that are difficult for even these big shots to sell, there’s enough going on here to set most, though not all, of them up for serious success. There’s not a scene in The Morning Show that Jennifer Aniston doesn’t seize with both hands and squeeze, like she’s determined to get every last possible drop of juice out of every orange she’s handed, no matter how underripe. In those hands, Alex is a brand, a performer, a carefully curated image; she’s also the person behind the mask, and that not so nice, not so collected person is in total chaos. Hers isn’t the only great performance on the show—Witherspoon is just as good, though Bradley, by virtue of her situation, doesn’t have quite as much to do. Crudup is the other standout, a kind of chaotic trickster god about whom only one thing can be trusted: his sheer enjoyment of the madness that surrounds him, and especially that which he creates. He’s magnetic. Duplass is also good, and amongst the supporting players, both Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Karen Pittman stand out each playing a Morning Show staffer whose burdens are heavy and growing heavier. Good acting: you’ll find it here.  Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell in The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Actors Aren’t Superheroes: On the other hand, Steve Carell doesn’t fare particularly well. A great actor can gloss over or justify some lackluster writing, though not entirely, and Carell is certainly a great actor, but by and large, Mitch’s presence tends to reduce the complexity of any episode he enters. It’s clear that the opposite was intended, and every so often that’s what happens. The Morning Show functions best as an exploration of systemic failure and corruption, of how a group of well-meaning people can grow to view toxic, harmful, abusive behavior as just the way things are. It’s not always subtle about that—just wait for the flashback to the day the Harvey Weinstein story breaks—but at its best, it’s searing, demanding the viewer to question the things they’ve written off as somehow acceptable. (A late-arriving episode centered largely on Mbatha-Raw’s character is particularly hard to watch.) Mitch throws all of that off-balance. The idea behind the casting is clear—Carell is the man whose inherent warmth made an acidic U.K. sitcom called The Office into something gentler, and as a not-at-all-thinly-veiled Matt Lauer figure, he’s supposed to be disarming, kindly, the kind of person who could never be a serial abuser. When he’s a ghost that haunts the hallways, that works. When he’s a person grappling with a world that’s shifting around him, it’s a mess: sometimes engaging, usually bewildering, often frustrating. (At one point he says, “First they came for the rapists…” and forgive the intrusion of the personal, but my soul left my body.) The character muddies the water, but not in an interesting way; Mitch is considerably less interesting than the rest of the show or the actor who plays him. There’s just too much, and it’s all nuclear-strength. Worst of all, the few Mitch scenes that feel vital and essential are just less effective because of all the rest.  Reese Witherspoon in The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  Let’s Roll: If the writing often stumbles, particularly where Mitch is concerned, it can also be fascinating, and showrunner Kerry Ehrin and her writers’ room rack up more hits than misses. But even when the story doesn’t work (and it gets really, really messy at various points throughout, from the chaotic pilot to the heavy-handed “ripped from the headlines” moments) it all looks great. Executive producer Mimi Leder (The Leftovers) leads a murderers’ row of directors, including Lynn Shelton (GLOW) and Michelle MacLaren (Breaking Bad). The episodes are typically expertly-paced and elegantly filmed, the glossiness of the on-camera world a sharp contrast to the darkness beyond the lights. Above all, these directors capture the staggering wealth of these characters—a level of excess that’s never filmed aspirationally. It baffles. MacLaren and Leder do this especially well. These cars, apartments, bags, shoes, balconies, sofas, elegant meals—they’re all part of a trade these people made, a visible demonstration of the incentive to stay silent. Sure, there are too many walk-and-talks, but there’s also a sense of the camera as witness, capturing the expert lies the characters tell themselves, the moments of self-recrimination they can’t totally hide.  The Morning Show (Apple TV+)  The Verdict: The Morning Show’s flaws are considerable, but they’re interesting flaws. It’s highly effective as a watchable, soapy drama, occasionally thrilling as a dissection of abuse in the workplace, and a top-tier showcase for a terrific ensemble of actors. It’s possible to imagine a version of this show that’s more sharp-toothed and less “timely”—something that baldly depicts the messiness of the world without veering quite so wildly between the didactic and the ridiculous. But that idealized show just doesn’t exist, just as the people Mitch and Alex pretend to be don’t really exist. But it’s worth pouring yourself a cup of coffee, putting on a cozy robe, and checking out The Morning Show. Where’s It Playing? The Morning Show is currently streaming on Apple TV+.

The actress has given fans various peeks inside of her gorgeous $21 million Bel Air estate ever since she joined Instagram in October 2019. The former Friends star is a self-confessed homebody, and there’s nowhere else she’d rather be than roaming her 8,500-square-foot house she purchased in 2011 and lovingly decorated to her own tastes. During the COVID lockdown when many people were going stir crazy, The Morning Show actress admitted during an April 2, 2020, remote appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she hadn’t left her home in three weeks … and was perfectly fine! “I’m a born agoraphobe,” Jen admitted about being home alone, adding, “This is kind of a dream — not a dream, it’s obviously a nightmare. But me personally, it’s not been that much of a challenge.” Jen went on to describe how she passed the time cleaning out various closets inside her mansion and finding so many incredible pieces of memorabilia that she forgot she had. More than a year later, she admitted to the host on a September 20, 2021, return to Kimmel that, “I’ve been in the house a lot. I’ve rearranged furniture … I went from the set from Sony studios to shoot [The] Morning Show right back to my house.” Before joining Instagram, the actress showed off her house — which she used to share with former husband Justin Theroux before their February 2018 split — on SmartWater’s Instagram, during a one-day account takeover in December 2017. In a series of six photos, Jen showed off her stunning property’s minimalist yet rustic aesthetic, and the Friends actress definitely found the perfect balance between classic and modern design in her home. Fans were lucky to have gotten a glimpse of Jen’s kitchen, two living rooms and part of the exterior of the house but kept some privacy by not showing any photos of her bedroom. Nonetheless, fans were grateful for the little peek showing Jen looking so comfy and cozy at home, especially with her beloved pet dogs.  Her pooches have been one of the main ways that the We’re the Millers star continues to show fans her home via Instagram, along with how she preps for various awards shows. Fans were able to get a look at her massive walk-in closet with numerous wardrobe areas as she was getting fitted in her gown for the 2020 Golden Globe Awards. She also showed off a rare look at her stunning Zen garden-style bathroom and long granite tub after winning a Screen Actors Guild Award in February 2020.

On her white wall, a modern gold sculpture with connected circles was visible, as a white orchid plant on her coffee table added a leafy touch. 23 of 27 Courtesy of Smartwater/Instagram During the Smartwater takeover, Jen was seen on the grounds of her mansion, throwing a ball to her Schnauzer mix, Clyde.

Over the two decades since her charming and funny character became a sitcom favourite, the actor has achieved even more recognition with her Hollywood roles. One of her best pieces of work of late includes Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, which earned her the coveted Screen Actors Guild Award. Despite having fans all over the world, Aniston stayed away from social media for most of her career, finally breaking the internet when she created her official Instagram account in 2019. Now a regular ’grammer, the actor often shares sneak peeks from her daily life from her Bel Air home. The mid-century mansion, full of Japanese-inspired design elements, is her haven. “Every corner you turn, you have an experience. Everywhere you look, you get a vista. We worked very hard to get that flow right,” she explained in an interview with Architectural Digest. The home, where Aniston lives with her dogs, is spread over 8,500 square feet and boasts four bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathrooms, a wine cellar, a luxurious pool, and a guesthouse.

Fans loved the tip and admired Aniston’s natural beauty. Ever since Jennifer Aniston launched her hair care line, LolaVie, she has intermittently blessed us with the hair advice we’ve craved since “The Rachel” became the most envied hairstyle to date. And her latest tip, which she shared to Instagram, shows off effortless air-dried waves (if you can even believe it) and the nurturing oil she uses to protect them. In the brief clip, the Morning Show star stands in her bathroom wearing a robe, her hair parted down the middle, and her golden waves framing her face. She demonstrates dropping a few ampules of LolaVie’s Lightweight Hair Oil into her palms before running them through her strands by section, and then scrunching her waves into place. Fans loved the quick tutorial, and of course, couldn’t help but compliment Aniston’s always-glowing beauty. “You are the most natural stunning goddess ⭐️,” Jenna Dewan commented. “Beautiful with curls. ❤️” another added. “The best hair products of all time,” someone else wrote. The oil, which fights and prevents damage with a vegan keratin complex, is one of LolaVie’s recent launches, the latest one being the brand’s long-awaited Restorative Shampoo and Conditioner. Aniston announced the drop with a steamy shower pic. Fun shoots and marketing aside, the brand is a huge passion project for the actress, who spent five years developing it before the first product launched. “I was inspired to create products that promote healthy hair and that are multifunctional—like a Swiss Army knife… but while performing these functions, they won’t damage your hair,” she told British Vogue in May. “While working with another brand years ago, I got the bug of getting to go behind the scenes and developing products, including selecting ingredients and creating formulas, and also the marketing that goes along with it. I just loved the process and wanted to do it in a much more meaningful way as a brand founder.”      Donald Trump has been masterful in converting his numerous legal problems into opportunities for campaigning and fundraising. ‘I was willing to share a $10,000 tip, but was reciprocated with hate and rumours,’ wrote Linsey Boyd  OTTAWA — Pushing a grocery cart up and down the aisles of Loblaws, Jagmeet Singh has to admit it\\'s all a little bit awkward.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '‘The Morning Show’ Season 2 Finale: Jennifer Aniston Catches COVID!', 'content': '                                                        It finally happened. After teasing the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in its Season 2 premiere, The Morning Show‘s characters collided head first with the Coronavirus. Stella Bok (Greta Lee) sported a mask in the office and Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup) erected a plexiglass wall around his desk. Daniel Henderson (Desean Terry) quit his job to drive cross country to be with his elderly relative. And Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) stupidly busted into a COVID ward in search of her brother. But no one was as affected as “she who went to Italy during its initial COVID spike,” Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston). The Morning Show Season 2 finale “Fever” gave Jennifer Aniston a rough case of COVID-19 as well as a hero moment? It was a fittingly insane ending for one of the most delirious dramas streaming on Apple TV+… Apple TV+’s The Morning Show prides itself on tackling the hot topics of the day before they grow stale. That means the first season took on the fallout of #MeToo in the news room as it was still happening and Season 2 was shot literally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Morning Show Season 2 might have premiered in mid-2021, but its opening sequence of an all-too-empty Manhattan in March 2020 signaled to the audience that we were about to watch characters like Bradley Jackson and Alex Levy fret over personal issues while the biggest news story in decades loomed in the near future. We’ve seen Daniel report from Wuhan and Alex travel to locked down Italy, but this was the episode when a main character finally got COVID. And what do you know? It was the person who totally ignored the dangers of traveling to a global pandemic epicenter! So yeah, Alex gets COVID. But what totally wild — and totally in line with The Morning Show‘s ethos — is that she’s not shot convalescing peacefully in bed. No, we watch Jennifer Aniston live out the horror of COVID-19. The chills, the sweats, the difficulty breathing, the isolation, the delirium, and the steam showers. Not only that, but Alex’s long-time producer and bestie Chip Black (Mark Duplass) convinces her to livestream her experience with COVID for UBA’s new streaming service. However that’s not the craziest part of this whole situation! Chip gains entry into Alex’s penthouse apartment by reassuring her that he also tested positive for COVID-19. He just doesn’t have symptoms yet. Later, though, we learn that Chip’s COVID test came back negative. He straight up lied about having COVID to make a livestream come together!!! And he put his life in jeopardy by willingly going into a lion’s den of virus! What the heck was Chip thinking?   “I think that Chip will do anything for Alex, if we’ve seen that pattern in Season 1, I think you can see that those are the tracks that lead him to a lot of the decisions he makes in Season 2,” Mark Duplass told Decider during an interview before The Morning Show Season 2 premiere. “I think what’s so great about Chip and Alex is that as horrific as they are to each other, and they do and say some really terrible things to each other in season two, ultimately there is a deep love there, Chip in particular is fun to watch because he doesn’t know how to love. He’s only been a creative producer for the show the last 20 years; that’s all he does. So he doesn’t know how to be intimate. He doesn’t know how to express himself. Usually that love comes in the form of self sacrifice. That’s how expresses his love, and he hasn’t figured out how to be a whole person on his two feet in a relationship yet because he’s never been asked to do that.” Alex’s COVID-centric livestream humanized the character at a time when her persona was being accosted at all angles. The special let her shine a light on a breaking news issue while showing off her acumen as a TV journalist. In short, it was a redemption for the Jennifer Aniston character. So yeah, The Morning Show once again redeemed one of its most morally ambiguous characters. This time by giving her COVID. Stay crazy, Morning Show. Stay crazy.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '', 'content': 'But just how do these highly sought-after stars match up in terms of lifestyle and the way they spend their dollars? Real estate portfolios These two bankable actresses each have their own amazing property profiles to show off. The former Friends star owns an 8,500 sq ft Bel Air residence valued at US$21 million in California, and a US$8.7 million flat in New York City. Her co-star, Witherspoon, also has several houses in her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, and a holiday home in the Bahamas. In 2020, the Academy Award-winning actress bought a US$15.9 million mansion in Los Angeles, California, according to Variety. Beauty products and appointments For her part, Witherspoon works out with personal trainer Michael George and, according to the Times, is a client of Dr. Harold Lancer, who helms a high-profile skincare clinic in California. Fast cars These wealthy ladies also splurge on automobiles. Witherspoon has been spotted running errands in a Mercedes-Benz E-Class, a Porsche Cayenne and Land Rover SUVs. Meanwhile, Aniston shared on InStyle’s podcast that her first real splurge was a vintage car – a cream coloured Mercedes 270 SL that she recalled “might’ve been like US$13,000”. Recently she’s been seen in a stunning Bentley Continental GT, priced at around US$222,000. Fancy holidays Off the clock, these blonde beauties sure know how to have fun! Witherspoon shares dreamy photos of herself relaxing in Costa Rica, Capri and Mexico and on yachting adventures with her girlfriends. Likewise, Aniston spent a luxurious honeymoon with then-husband Justin Theroux in Bora-Bora and hit the ski slopes in Wyoming and Colorado during the holidays with pals Sandra Bullock and Jimmy Kimmel. Watches and jewellery Charity These Morning Show co-stars have both lent their voices and opened their wallets to various causes over the years. Aniston is known to have donated US$500,000 to Medecins Sans Frontieres for the organisation’s efforts in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, and also promoted Friends merchandise to raise money for America Cares. Meanwhile Witherspoon has opened her arms to her local Nashville community, funding almost US$175,000 worth of projects for public schools, according to E! Online. In the wake of the Me Too movement, both women reportedly also sent US$500,000 to the Time’s Up campaign’s GoFundMe page.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The Morning Show Is a Triumph of Bad Taste', 'content': 'The seventh episode of The Morning Show, the new Apple TV+ series set behind the scenes of a morning news program, opens with Billy Crudup tearing into a falafel sandwich. “Best falafel in all five boroughs!” he says to the guy next to him, who is desperate to start scheming, not make small talk about the tahini smear on his pita. Crudup is not bothered. As the network executive Cory Ellison, he waltzes through the series like an imperturbable demon cherub, reacting to workplace disasters as if they’re juicy Twitter spats. He’s a delighted schemer, so contagiously overconfident that when he blows hard about woke Twitter and Americans’ need for entertainment, not news, he’s buoyant. Even when he’s wrong, he floats! And he is not wrong about the falafel. “I read about it on Eater!” he proclaims. When I heard this line, I cocked my head sideways, like dogs do when they hear a strange noise. The conventions of TV dictate that dialogue serves a purpose, but what purpose does this passing reference serve, and was it worth the entire show going on location with a New York City food cart? None of the possible answers seems sufficient: He’s the kind of guy who reads the internet? who likes to be in the know? who really relishes saying the word Eater? The line triggers the ear, registering as a something, but it’s a nothing. The Morning Show’s communiqué is coming in loud and fuzzy. In a moment when so much TV is numbingly competent, The Morning Show is bracingly so. It’s competent by the skin of its teeth, the quick of a fingernail, Crudup’s maniacal smile, the roving part in Reese Witherspoon’s bad—but improved over the course of the season!—wig. I binged it in a state of giggly frenzy, each episode another Mento dropped into the soda bottle that was me, fizzing wildly, liable to spray anyone who came too close. Look, I said—out loud! I’ve been babbling about this show like I dreamed about it last night—it’s like a tightrope act where you think they’re going to fall, but they don’t! It’s a train that looks like it’s about to derail the whole time, but it doesn’t! It’s the Jennifer Aniston–dissecting–“Jennifer Aniston” event program I kind of knew I was waiting for! It’s as metatextually fascinating as it is intratextually uneven, a $300 million experiment in which all of the seams are showing, and it almost makes it fashion. It’s not great, but oh, God, is it interesting. It’s not perfect, but oh, Lord, is it watchable. It’s not very good, but hurry up, sit by me, it’s starting. In the two years leading up to its release, The Morning Show was widely gossiped about as an epic disaster. Apple TV+ was rich but clueless, and production was a mess. In late November 2017, just weeks after outbidding all comers for a series starring Aniston, Witherspoon, and Steve Carell and based on Brian Stelter’s book about the Today show, Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate sexual behavior. So the series changed course and showrunners and was reborn as a #MeToo parable. As The Morning Show begins, longtime co-anchor Mitch Kessler (Carell) has been fired for sexual misconduct, leaving his co-host Alex Levy (Aniston) in a precarious yet powerful position, which she impulsively uses to name Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon), a journeyman news journalist with an attitude problem, as her new on-air partner. It’s a compact premise that belies the show’s unruly largesse, a too-muchness that makes it almost shaggy, despite the pristine antisepticness of its visual detailing, the brightly lit studio sets, hotel rooms, and penthouse fortresses. The show gestures at a great big, ridiculous world where everyone has an agenda and a story, but not necessarily any screen time. There are assistants and producers who show up over and over again without getting more than a few lines. There’s The Morning Show’s weekend anchor, a black gay man who should be in the running for the co-anchor spot but can’t get anyone to give him more than lip service. There’s a young assistant having a love affair with the weatherman, who worries he’s abusing his power, even as she scoffs at the suggestion. There are reporters at the Times trying to break more stories about this toxic workplace and a powerful journalist at New York magazine (Marcia Gay Harden, playing a version of Rebecca Traister) trying to do the same. There are powerful men at every level desperate to hang on to their jobs: The Morning Show’s pathetic producer (a horribly miscast and smarmy Mark Duplass), Crudup’s Cory Ellison, and their nefarious boss Fred (Tom Irwin). And that’s the straight-faced stuff! The series’s chaotic beginnings give the whole thing an ad hoc vibe. Characters who were written one way in early episodes become something else in later ones. The writers seem to be sorting out what they think about their #MeToo story—and so the plot—on the fly, a fumbling that at least has the virtue of verisimilitude. Every episode contains at least one overwrought, hot air–filled monologue, and then there’s everything else: implausible viral videos, Kelly Clarkson appearances, a Sondheim number, tragic news events used as window dressing, and a character named—it’s worth harping on—Bradley Jackson. The name Bradley Jackson is silly enough on its own, but achieves a state of overdetermined nirvana when you realize the character playing across from Jennifer Aniston, in a show she executive produces, is named: Brad. BRAD! So much of the power of The Morning Show comes from it being a prime piece of Anistonology, a field of study as full of personas, mythologies, and Easter eggs as any superhero saga. In the decades since Aniston played Rachel Green on Friends, she has intermittently tried to prove her acting chops and send up her public image in a string of roles that have not made a dent in the primacy of Jen, our down-to-earth, approachable, woebegone, babyless, husband-seeking pal, familiar from reruns and tabloids, where she is still, to this day, rumored to be remarrying her ex-husband. Alex Levy is an emphatic, impassioned rejoinder to all of this. Like Aniston, Alex is a beloved and cozy public figure that Americans feel overly familiar with. But underneath her cheery façade, Alex is prickly, overwhelmed, impulsive, strategic, furious, and lonely. She’s not Aniston, but the details don’t matter: She’s a woman everyone thinks they know, but they have no idea. The Morning Show is a two-hander by any empirical measure, but Witherspoon recedes into the background even as she keeps her screen time. She’s gamely playing a part—a quintessentially good-hearted, plucky, and high-strung Reese Witherspoon character—but it’s just a part. Aniston is singing her heart out (in one scene, literally) in this opera of her experience, feasting like she’s never had a meal, cursing like there’s an off chance she might be able to F-bomb her way out of being America’s Sweetheart. Aniston DGAF about likability in this role; she’s ready to rip it up, stomp on it, and throw it in the toilet, which isn’t to say she is not intermittently very likable. Much of this is a credit to Aniston’s performance, the way she conveys Alex’s intense loneliness by bringing forward and holding back different pieces of herself with everyone she knows—her public, the press, her colleagues, her estranged husband, her daughter—except for her now-disgraced co-anchor, the only person intimately familiar with her grueling isolation. But anyone familiar with her story can recognize her gung-ho embrace of this role as an escape attempt: Let her out of the box! There’s so much will in this performance, so much mighty vim, and it all comes from Aniston’s gameness to do whatever is required—and to do it, mostly, very well. She’ll shoot daggers at hair and makeup, curse out her teenager, cry, panic, puke, lose her cool, jockey, scheme, manipulate, backstab. She’ll even play the enabler of a sex pest. What Alex knew and when she knew it is one of The Morning Show’s central mysteries—second only to what Mitch did, who covered it up, and who leaked it. In the early episodes, Mitch’s misbehavior is left vague. It gives the show time to paint in all the grays, to hear from the colleagues who found him to be a funny, good-time flirt, the ones who had unregretted sexual encounters with him; to make a distinction between him and more Cosby-esque predators. Mitch is a self-pitying, unreflective egomaniac who thinks he’s just unlucky to be part of the first generation of powerful men to be held accountable for using their power for sex. But holding back the details of his misbehavior feels like a play for time, a way for the show to figure out how bad he should be, while keeping that bad behavior from breaking the series, making audiences wonder: Why are we devoting all this screen time to a supercreep? A similar calculation is going on with Alex. Though Aniston is down to do whatever unbecoming thing is asked of her, the show itself seems intermittently panicked about how far it can go in villainizing her. It’s like a triple-exposure ballet, where it’s not just Alex Levy in a pas de deux with “Jennifer Aniston”; it’s the show itself, weighing just how dark it can make her and still deliver on the promise of a Jennifer Aniston TV show. By the time The Morning Show commits more fully to Alex’s immorality, it has an escape plan at the ready. Aniston may be desperate to get out of the likability box, but the show has another box ready for her, though it is, at least, a much more expansive one. Before signing off to go rewatch a few episodes of The Morning Show, permit me a tangent. One of the pleasures of sentience is the way that life is constantly creating harmonies, making this rhyme with that, here chime with there, one book resonate with another that it has no connection to except the order in which you read them. As I was rolling around in The Morning Show, Martin Scorsese wrote an op-ed clarifying his position on superhero movies, opening another round in the ongoing parlor game where journalists have to ask every person involved in the entertainment business to please give them web traffic by opining on the value of superhero movies. There’s a lot to say about all of this—but what on earth is any of it doing in a review of The Morning Show? Here’s how this rhymes with that: We’ve forgotten how to have bad taste with dignity, with humility, with any sense of proportion. Bad taste, like a bellybutton, is something everyone has. To be human is to love unwisely but too well, to be thrilled, satisfied by the middling thing that hits the spot, whether it’s a movie or a partner. It’s bad taste, fine taste, whatever taste, not good taste, that makes us singular, particular, human. (Who only loves good things? It’s too boring to contemplate!) While we could hardly be accused of living in an era of good taste, we are living in a moment where we have elevated bad taste to the point that it no longer functions with any self-effacement. Bad taste no longer knows that it’s not that good. No one should feel bad about the things they love or feel guilty about their pleasures, wherever they find them—but I do think we should try to remain aware that personal pleasure is not an exact equivalent to quality. Love what you love, but try to see it clear. The Morning Show, a series starring two women and set in the world of morning news, is likely to have a largely female audience—and we’re the ones who are always overapologizing for the things that we like anyway. So many excellent shows have been trivialized because they seemed to be for women, set in women’s worlds. I’m not apologizing or trivializing when I say that while I delighted in The Morning Show, which is sociologically and narratively fascinating, has, in Aniston and Crudup, two gonzo performances, and is more fun than I’ve had in front of a screen in a long time, it also lacks the kind of purposefulness, control, and self-knowledge that makes something great. Its weaknesses are part of the good time, but that still doesn’t make them strengths. Pass it on. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Audio deepfakes flood social media platforms', 'content': ' Bitdefender Labs has been keeping up with the latest modus operandi of cybercrooks who adapt emerging technologies to siphon money from consumers. Artificial intelligence is just one of the many tools that help in the creation and successful dissemination of online schemes to extort money and sensitive information. This paper focuses on voice cloning (audio deepfakes) schemes and how they are proliferated via social media to trick unsuspecting victims. Before delving deeper into the main subject of our research, we need to offer some insight into how voice cloning is accomplished and some of its more unorthodox uses. What is voice cloning? Voice cloning is the process of using AI tools to create synthetic copies of another individual’s voice. This sophisticated technology uses deep learning techniques to replicate a person’s speech and create highly realistic and convincing audio of a human voice. Compared to synthetic voices generated entirely by a computer using antiquated text-to-speech systems, voice cloning uses the actual voice of another individual to produce a realistic rendition of the original. Voice cloning in a nutshell: Voice cloning has many legitimate uses in education, healthcare and entertainment, including: Despite these many lawful uses, voice cloning technology is frequently misused for fraudulent activities. Voice cloning scams use AI to duplicate the voices of trusted individuals to manipulate, deceive, and financially and physically harm others. The malicious practices extend to: Social media platforms – an ideal dumping ground for voice cloning scams Millions of individuals use social media daily, so it’s no wonder these platforms have become the dumping ground for many emerging scams that employ AI and voice cloning technologies. These two advancements alone are a game changer for scammers, who are quick to exploit them to enhance the reach of their fraudulent schemes. Now, what gives scammers on social media the edge is not just the sheer number of potential victims, hackable accounts, and personal data that is so easily obtainable. Scammers have learned to tailor their approach using advertisers’ tools and ads to potentially reach billions of users from across the globe. Concerns among US consumers regarding the exposure to deepfakes and voice cloning have been significant in the past year. So much so that, according to a recent survey by Voicebot and Pindrop, more than 57% of respondents expressed very high concern over the subject. Bitdefender Labs has closely monitored the phenomena of voice cloning scams in the past weeks, especially on social media platforms such as Facebook. Our researchers quickly discovered voice cloning scams on Meta’s popular social platform. Here are some of our key findings:   How celebrity voice cloning scams play out on Facebook Over the past three weeks, Meta’s social platforms have been bombarded with fraudulent posts featuring celebrity-endorsed giveaways that promise access to exclusive products and services. These scams, which are increasingly common, exploit users’ natural trust and attraction towards the life of the rich and famous. We all know celebrities are very good at selling things to the public. Thus, exposure to apparent celebrity-endorsed ads on social media is more likely to succeed in duping unwary internet users. Consumers in the US and Europe have been exposed to various audio deep-faked ads of well-known celebrities, including Jennifer Aniston, Oprah, and Mr. Beast that promise “free” giveaways to a lucky batch of viewers. All the deepfake videos we analysed tell the same bogus story: everyone who is watching is part of an “exclusive group of 10,000 individuals” who can acquire exclusive products for a modest payment starting from $2 (depending on the ad/product). In the screenshot below, scammers cloned the voice of YouTuber Mr. Beast, whose charitable spirit skyrocketed him to internet stardom. They also made a good synchronisation when tweaking the video, this being one of the more compelling and well-orchestrated audio deepfakes we’ve seen in the campaign to date.  Ad videos are less than 30 seconds long and urge viewers to act quickly and click on a link to benefit from an “incredible opportunity immediately.” So what’s the catch? Well, lucky people only pay for shipping on the “world’s largest iPhone 15 giveaway.” Sounds far-fetched? That’s because it is. Upon clicking the fraudulent link, users are taken to a fake website promoting the giveaway that lists a limited number of devices/products remaining.  They then need to fill out a bogus survey.  The last page is where the user must fill out details and pay for shipping. Payment is higher than the amount specified in the video. Of course, the user must provide various personal details before proceeding to checkout, including name, country, address, and contact information (email and phone number). During checkout, users must provide their credit card numbers to pay for shipping.     How can you protect against deep fake audio scams? Detecting voice cloning can be very challenging, especially since the advancements in artificial intelligence and deep learning technologies have significantly enhanced the quality of synthetically created voices. However, there are several tips you can employ to help detect and protect yourself against voice cloning:                     A dedicated channel for Boards, C-Suite Executives and Cyber Risk Leaders to highlight cyber threats as a key business issue.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston explains cutting off unvaccinated friends', 'content': 'Jennifer Aniston has expanded on why she has cut off some of her friends who have refused to be vaccinated. Earlier this week, the Friends actress said she had \"lost a few people from [her] weekly routine\" who had decided against having a Covid jab. Some of her Instagram followers have since asked why she was so worried, given that she had been vaccinated. \"Because if you have the variant, you are still able to give it to me,\" she posted on Thursday. \"I may get slightly sick but I will not be admitted to a hospital and or die. \"But I can give it to someone else who does not have the vaccine and whose health is compromised (or has a previous existing condition) - and therefore I would put their lives at risk.\" The actress made the comments on her Instagram story, which allows users to post pictures, videos and messages which only stay live for 24 hours. In her interview with InStyle, published on Tuesday, Aniston said: \"There\\'s still a large group of people who are anti-vaxxers or just don\\'t listen to the facts. It\\'s a real shame. \"I\\'ve just lost a few people in my weekly routine who have refused or did not disclose [whether or not they had been vaccinated], and it was unfortunate. I feel it\\'s your moral and professional obligation to inform, since we\\'re not all podded up and being tested every single day.\" She added: \"It\\'s tricky because everyone is entitled to their own opinion - but a lot of opinions don\\'t feel based in anything except fear or propaganda.\" Aniston is one of the most famous actresses in the world, thanks in large part to her portrayal of Rachel on the US sitcom Friends. Earlier this year, the cast of the show hit the headlines when they reunited on screen for the first time in 17 years. Aniston broke an Instagram record (which has since been beaten) when she joined the social media platform in 2019, and now has 37 million followers. Earlier this week, US news network CNN sacked three employees for returning to work unvaccinated. CNN boss Jeff Zucker said the company had \"a zero tolerance policy on this\". In the UK on Thursday, the new NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard urged unvaccinated young adults to get jabbed, saying it is \"so important\". More than 46 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. These high vaccination levels have created a \"protective wall\", the government has said, sufficient to end legal restrictions on social contact. First vaccines are now being offered to everyone aged 16 and above as well as children over the age of 12 who are at higher risk from Covid. The NHS website states that vaccines are \"the best way to protect yourself and others\" against Covid, noting how they reduce the risk of people getting seriously ill or dying from the virus, while also lessening the chances of them catching or spreading it. However, they also note that vaccinated people can still catch and spread coronavirus. While mild side effects are common, they say, more serious ones such as allergic reactions or blood clotting are rare. Aniston may have publicly championed vaccines, but other entertainment stars including Stone Roses singer Ian Brown, Van Morrison and Eric Clapton have expressed concerns. Clapton described his experience of taking the vaccine as \"disastrous\", and blamed \"propaganda\" for overstating its safety. He, Brown and Richard Ashcroft have all pulled out of a festival appearances over their refusal to play events that require vaccination proof as a condition of entry. From the end of September, the government hopes to introduce a law requiring two jabs to go to nightclubs and some other venues in England. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion, email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk. The series follows after the success of Mr Bates Vs the Post Office, which drew in over 10m viewers. The actress told University of Surrey students she would have loved to have studied forensics. The eight-part series, This City Is Ours, will be set and made in and around Liverpool, the BBC says. Robin Windsor\\'s family also ask for the \"constant\" speculation around the 44-year-old\\'s death to stop.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': '‘The Morning Show’ review: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon spin in pointless circles in Season 2 of the Apple TV+ drama', 'content': 'Storage Preferences\\nThird Parties        eNewspaper TRENDING: Set at a fictional TV network beset by #MeToo scandals and an overabundance of egos and corporate jousting, “The Morning Show” could have been a fascinating look at how the TV sausage is made. But Season 2 of the Apple TV+ drama, starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, is as much of a mess — if not more so — than it was in Season 1. When we last saw frenemies and morning show co-hosts Alex (Aniston) and Bradley (Witherspoon), they had gone off script, live on air, to expose the rot at their television network that had long allowed and protected a culture of sexual harassment. The cold open of Season 2 picks up moments later and it’s pandemonium and Alex is whisked away by her entourage. “Keep your phone on,” she tells Bradley as she’s being hustled out of the building: “I’ll call you.” Bradley just stands there, slackjawed. What happens next? What are the costs of speaking truth to power? Because there are always costs. That might have been a halfway decent starting point for the new 10-episode season, but showrunner Kerry Ehrin punts, jumping ahead eight months to when the dust has mostly settled. Bradley is now co-hosting the show with someone else and she’s transformed into the perky morning personality she used to disdain, while Alex is holed up in a lavish cabin in Maine writing her memoirs and feeling sorry for herself. But of course Alex is lured back (it’s unclear why she ever left) because she’s powerless against the words “You are the only thing that can save us” and “You have yet to do your greatest work!” Is “The Morning Show” satirizing the fakery and self-important puffery of morning shows or is it buying into it? I can’t tell. Put another way, it’s a drama delivered with a wink, but what is it winking at exactly? I can never figure out where the show stands on anything and I wish it had a more gimlet-eyed energy about the infotainment of TV news. In the wake of Alex and Bradley’s on-air bombshell, the mercurial head of news (and the company’s No. 1 agent of chaos, played with piquant flair by Billy Crudup) is fired — but no, wait, suddenly he’s now head of the network. Does any of this make sense without multiple viewings? Not for me, it didn’t.  Then there’s the Mitch factor: Alex’s long-standing co-host (Steve Carell), previously dumped from his job after an avalanche of allegations, has fled with his millions to a villa in Lake Como to lick his wounds. He has a whole arc this season, one that attempts to show the human side of a man who is grappling with … oh, forget it. I really don’t care about this character’s redemption or his humanity. If any of this sounds compelling, then “The Morning Show” may be for you. I found it deeply, despondently boring, which is a strange thing to say about a season that has the bones of a nighttime soap, right down to a hotel hallway fracas between Alex and Bradley that seemed headed in the direction of Alexis-Krystle territory from the days of “Dynasty.” But weirdly, “The Morning Show” doesn’t even fully commit to that, with Alex and Bradley separated on their own trajectories for much of the season. Considering their frisson is basically all that’s keeping this show afloat, that’s a curious choice. A bigger issue is that neither character is all that well defined anymore. Alex was once the veteran megastar — tightly wound and more insecure than not, but there was some savvy there. This season she lacks all of that, reduced to a series of tics and needs. Bradley was originally introduced as the straight talking “serious” journalist who was out of her depth when it came to the gloss of network television; now that she has that part figured out, she’s just … there. She’s rattled when information about her private life hits the gossip columns, but the show also hints at another secret affair with someone above her at work, which neither she nor the boss see as potentially problematic for either of their careers. I don’t have a problem with Bradley being a hypocrite. Characters are allowed to be flawed. But the show itself doesn’t seem to grasp her hypocrisy or want to engage with it.The show doesn’t follow through and engage with anything that’s particularly challenging and ends up feeling intellectually disingenuous as a result. Previously, the show had actually bothered to portray how lower level staffers were affected by all this meshugas (ahem, negatively) but none of that exists this time out. You can’t help but notice that the white characters on “The Morning Show” get fuller storylines (including the addition of an icy nighttime news magazine star played by a terrific Julianna Margulies). People of color on the show are given a handful of moments to express emotion (usually pained disgust), but their personal lives away from the office are a mystery. As characters, they exist to flesh out this world but they are never fleshed out themselves, from Karen Pittman’s unflappable executive producer (I want to know more about her and hear her in private conversations with people she trusts), Greta Lee’s wonderfully pinched head of news (a character who has no real authority despite her title, which feels like a real phenomenon women in her position might experience, but she never talks about it or even talks about, ya know, the news) and Desean Terry’s frustrated anchor (who has legitimate beefs, but again that’s all we see of him: perpetually hitting a brick wall at work). It kills me that Shari Belafonte’s floor director is reduced to a handful of lines that amount to, “Annnnd we’re out.” Ultimately the show would rather spend time rehabilitating Mitch in Lake Como than give any of the aforementioned characters substantial storylines. I found myself wondering about those kinds of choices and who the show prioritizes as worthy of three-dimensional portraits. There’s a hilarious absence of personal and corporate publicists in the mix, who would absolutely be micromanaging these scandals. Even the aesthetics of “The Morning Show” feel off: It looks expensively made, and yet so many details are visually lifeless or just wrong. Why does Bradley still live in a hotel suite nearly a year after moving to New York? Why not at least get Alex’s hair right? It’s too easy-breezy — too much like Aniston’s own hair rather than styled and sprayed within an inch of its life — for someone who works on morning television. That might be a detail that bugs me the most. Ultimately “The Morning Show” suffers from haphazard storytelling and an emphasis on the least compelling corners of this show-bizzy side of TV news. Alex insists on rehiring her disgraced and bizarrely loyal producer Chip (Mark Duplass), and there’s a lot of time and energy spent on Chip’s feelings and failings and … to say his presence feels pointless would be an understatement. (Between Jay Duplass on “The Chair” and Mark Duplass this season on “The Morning Show,” the Duplass brothers have the market cornered on white guy characters who feel inessential to the larger story.) Hovering like a storm cloud over all of this is the inevitable arrival of COVID-19. I don’t have a strong opinion about that either way, but at one point a character is convinced to go on the air from home while sick as some sort of we’re-all-in-this-together special broadcast. The show plays it like a triumphant moment of dedication rather than what it is: Exploitation. “The Morning Show” keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don’t know if that’s supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all. “The Morning Show” — 2 stars (out of 4) Where to watch: Apple TV+ nmetz@chicagotribune.com What to eat.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon tease new Apple series The Morning Show', 'content': ' Apple finally lifted the curtains on its much-anticipated reunion of Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, revealing the first footage from their new TV series Monday. The Friends alums appeared at Apple’s special event to introduce The Morning Show as a series that would examine the people and politics of the morning news world. “Through the prism of those under-slept, over-adrenalized people in front of and behind the camera, we take an honest look at the complex relationships between women and men in the workplace, and we engage in the conversation people are a little too afraid to have unless they’re behind closed doors,” Aniston said. But of course as Aniston pointed out, “You can’t have an honest look at complex relationships between men and women with just women.” Cue Steve Carell, who bumbled onto stage promising to bring “the manliness” to the show, teasing that his character is “bold and dynamic, with a lot of gravitas. He’s a great listener and relatable and extremely handsome.” “The Morning Show is seen through the eyes of two ambitious, aspirational female characters,” Witherspoon said, as Carell interjected, “and a prominent male.” Witherspoon added that the show is a “high-velocity thrill ride in which we pose questions without easy answers and shine a light on the fault lines in our society at this very complicated cultural moment.” Apple did not reveal a Morning Show trailer, but footage from the show was featured in a teaser for Apple TV+, featuring scenes with a brunette Witherspoon and Aniston in her on-air anchor role. Mimi Leder, who is directing The Morning Show, told EW last year that the series will center on women in power and the politics of the environment. Alongside Aniston, Carell also makes his return to television with this series, playing Mitch Kessler, an anchor struggling to stay relevant in a fast-shifting media landscape. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billy Crudup, Bel Powley, Karen Pittman, Desean Terry, and Mark Duplass will also star. The series is loosely based the book Top of the Morning, by CNN correspondent Brian Stelter (who is a consultant for the show), and penned by Kerry Ehrin, with whom Apple has an overall content deal. Ehrin, Witherspoon, and Aniston are all executive producers. Related content: ', 'source_domain': 'ew.com', 'url': 'https://ew.com/tv/2019/03/25/apple-event-the-morning-show/', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'How Much Is Jennifer Aniston Being Paid to Return to TV?', 'content': ' It’s hard to believe that Friends went off the air almost 15 years ago. It seems like only yesterday when millions of people would tune in each week to see the whole gang, including Jennifer Aniston, navigate their way through complicated relationships, cherished friendships, and even tackle parenting issues.  Since then, Aniston has starred in several different movies, including The Breakup, Wanderlust, and The Bounty Hunter, just to name a few. Although she has had a prosperous movie career, the 50-year-old actress has decided to return to TV where she will star and produce a new series about a morning TV show. Due to the fact that she made up to $1 million per episode on her last television series, many fans are starting to wonder just how much money she will be making when she returns to TV. Here is everything we know so far about her new TV show and her new salary. The new TV show, which does not have a title yet, will star Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Both A-list actresses will also be co-producing the new show as well. Jennifer Aniston with her production company, Echo Films, and Reese Witherspoon and her production company, Hello Sunshine, will be teaming up with Michael Ellenberg to be the three executive producers of the new series. This isn’t the first time the two actresses have worked together. In 2000, the Legally Blonde actress guest starred on two episodes of Friends where she played Jill Green, Rachel’s younger sister. The two seemed to remain friends since their brief appearance together on the hit ’90s sitcom. At the 2015 Oscars, Entertainment Tonight caught up with Jennifer Aniston on the red carpet. The interviewer asked Aniston if her and Witherspoon were pals. Jennifer responded: “Yeah, she’s my little sister; even if she is only my TV sister.” The tech giant, Apple, has recently decided to expand their business and compete in the video-streaming arena. Their move to getting the rights to stream one of the most sought-after television series proves they are not only here to play the game, but they are here to win. According to the New York Times, Apple fought hard for Witherspoon’s and Aniston’s new show and beat out other well-known competitors, like Netflix and Showtime. Jennifer Lopez Once Received a $105,000 Toilet Seat Containing Diamonds from an Ex Although there is still a lot about this show that remains a mystery, we do know the basic premise. According to People, the show will be a dramatic series that is inspired by Brian Steller’s non-fiction book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.  Another thing that we know is it will feature a star-studded cast. In addition to Aniston and Witherspoon, Steve Carell has also signed on for the new show and will also be making his first return to the small screen since he stopped filming his last hit show, the American version of The Office. We thought that Jennifer Aniston’s salary that she made working on Friends was impressive. However, according to Variety, both Aniston and Witherspoon will be making $1.1 million an episode for their new show. Steve Carell is reported to be making $600,000 per episode.  We are still not sure when the new show will finally be ready for fans to see, but with the high level of talent that the cast and crew have, we know that when it finally does air, it will have been well worth the wait.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston Admits She’ll Never Go Gray', 'content': 'The Morning Show star is embracing 50—but that doesn\\'t mean she\\'ll stop seeing her hair colorist. There comes a time in every woman\\'s life when she must decide whether she wants to embrace her natural grays, or dye them—and Jennifer Aniston says her signature dark blonde locks are \"hair\" to stay. The actress, who\\'s currently promoting her upcoming Apple TV Plus series The Morning Show, covers the October issue of InStyle, featuring a photo shoot showing off her freckles. For the story, Aniston opened up about her milestone birthday this past February—and how it felt to turn the big 5-0 in Hollywood, a town that\\'s historically placed a premium on youth. \"Fifty was the first time I thought, ‘Well, that number,\\'\" Aniston told the magazine. \"I don’t know what it is because I don’t feel any different. Things aren’t shutting down in any way. I feel physically incredible.\" Which is why, she says, it\\'s so odd that the way people address her appearance has changed. \"So it’s weird that it’s all of a sudden getting telegraphed in a way that’s like, \\'You look amazing for your age.\\' I think we need to establish some etiquette around that dialogue and verbiage.\" The Friends alum, whose \\'coif was once so iconic that her shaggy style on the show had fans requesting \"The Rachel\" at salons across America, revealed that she used to cut hair for money as a teenager herself. But as for her own hair at 50, Aniston says she doesn\\'t plan to stop seeing her colorist anytime soon. Or ever, to be honest. \"I’m not gonna lie—I don’t want gray hair,” Aniston says. No gray growout for Jen, thanks. Aniston also shared a few tidbits from her beauty regimen—count her among those singing the praises of celery juice. She also swears she\\'s been using Aveeno, which she endorses, since she was a teen. If she could turn back time, though, she says she\\'d be more diligent about one tried-and-true skin preserver: Wearing sunscreen every day. Aniston is co-producing and starring in Apple TV +\\'s upcoming series The Morning Show, alongside fellow producer Reese Witherspoon. She plays a TV host whose colleague, played by Steve Carrell, is forced to resign following a #MeToo-esque scandal, and she\\'s left to fight for her job as Witherspoon\\'s character is groomed to possibly replace her. The Morning Show premieres on Apple TV Plus when the streaming service debuts this fall, and Apple has already committed to a season 2. \"When we found out that we were among one of the first shows to be bought by Apple, Reese and I both had this pinch-me moment,\" she says. \"The first women to help launch a network as actors and producers, having a beautiful piece of that pie that we really earned and deserved.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': \"'The Morning Show' Recap, Season 2, Episode 1: She's Blonde Again!\", 'content': 'Linda Holmes Bradley (Reese Witherspoon) has a new look as the second season of The Morning Show kicks off.  It takes the second season of Apple TV+\\'s The Morning Show seven-and-a-half minutes to get real sweaty. Let\\'s step back: The first season, which aired a decade or so ago in late 2019, was the prestige drama project that Apple wanted to use to launch its streaming service: Big names! Current events! Finger on the pulse! Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston played a newbie and a veteran morning show host, respectively, who are thrown together after Aniston\\'s former on-air partner, played by Steve Carell, is fired following a sexual harassment scandal. But a funny thing happened on the way to acclaim: The show was of decidedly middling quality. (And by \"the show,\" I mean The Morning Show, not the show-within-the-show also called The Morning Show, which we shall call TMS here so we don\\'t all lose our collective bearings.) Some elements, like Billy Crudup\\'s gleefully weaselly executive Cory, worked. Other parts, like the plentiful scenes in which Mitch (Carell) felt sorry for himself, did not. The uneven season ended when Alex (Aniston) and Bradley (Witherspoon) blew the lid off of a culture of cover-ups at UBA, called out their big bosses on air with the help of Cory and show executive producer Chip (Mark Duplass), and ... fade to black. Cory (Billy Crudup) is as gross as ever, and as hard to entirely resist.  And so, Season 2 presents a curious question for The Morning Show: What do you do when your show has all the talent and money in the world, but the first season just didn\\'t work? You can\\'t just move on, because you\\'re a tentpole for the streaming service you\\'re working for, which might as well be called We Print Money TV+, and all they want is to make you a success. What do you do with a second season? Double down? Make changes? Push ahead? Oh, and remember, before you answer: Your first season about television production and the magic of being wealthy in New York City aired right before a pandemic hit and changed everything about television production and the magic of ... well, being wealthy somewhere while maintaining a residence in New York City. This is why I wanted to follow this show through this season — not because it\\'s so good, and not because it\\'s so loved, and not because I intend to drill down into its approximately four million subplots to make sense of every one. These episodes are a story in themselves. They are the story of how a huge, expensive project that came pre-loaded with publicity and talent and money and a current-events hook tries to move forward after nearly two years away. The season-two premiere opens with a couple of scenes showing the immediate aftermath of Alex and Bradley\\'s big rebellion, which the show now seems to place sometime in early 2019. This sequence goes about the way you would expect, in that Alex\\'s team is frantic to protect her and The Suits are furious. (\"You\\'re a dead man,\" says disgraced network boss Fred \"Angela Chase\\'s father from My So-Called Life\" Micklen to Cory, to which Cory flatly responds, \"Said the corpse.\") A Memo From The Department Of Calendar Pedantry: It appeared during Season 1 that it was taking place in late 2019, given that TMS was covering the 2019 California wildfires. But now, it seems like they\\'ve retconned that season\\'s events to happen much earlier in the year, in order to have COVID strike when it\\'s been many months since Alex quit. Then you get the credits (which remain excellent), and then there\\'s a sequence in which \"Return To Me\" plays while a camera flies through the COVID-emptied streets of New York in March 2020. Then we move back \"three months earlier,\" to New Year\\'s Eve, where we begin this season proper. So if you\\'re keeping up, it\\'s already been early 2019, then it was March 2020, and now it\\'s New Year\\'s Eve 2019. We are not at the eight-minute mark yet! BUT WAIT. Help is on the way, because once we are affixed to time and space, we cut to a blonde Bradley — that is to say, a blonde Reese Witherspoon — on The Morning Show singing \"What Are You Doing New Year\\'s Eve?\" with Hasan Minhaj, who it takes a minute to understand is not playing himself. He is playing Eric, Bradley\\'s new co-host, who came in after Alex quit in the spring. The two of them are promoting their New Year\\'s Eve special, obliviously try-harding their way through the song, while the control room takes in news of yet another ugly UBA revelation that\\'s gone public, this time involving allegations against the anchor of the evening news. Eric (Hasan Minhaj) is Bradley\\'s partner on TMS — but not for long.  You can almost see the perspiration dripping from the show: They made Reese blonde again! There is singing and dancing! Don\\'t you like Hasan Minhaj? Staffing TMS is, as it was in the first season, the opening crisis. Bradley and Eric haven\\'t been getting great ratings, and now Eric is set to be plucked from TMS and given that plum evening anchor job that\\'s about to open up. Bradley needs a new partner. A Memo From The Department Of What\\'s More Fun Than Examining The Org Chart?: It\\'s worth noting that there\\'s a new arrangement of bosses: Cory is still the head of news, new cast member Stella (Greta Lee) is under him, Mia is the new Chip (the show executive producer), and Chip is gone, off getting engaged to Chip\\'s Girlfriend — we\\'ll be catching up with him later. Cory suggests they get Alex back, but Stella wants to be allowed to explore possible co-anchors for Bradley who are not white women — in fact, it seems she would like to explore dumping Bradley and starting from scratch. This is a non-starter for Cory, who has always had a warm relationship with Bradley that seems to have further warmed since Alex left. So Cory is letting Stella negotiate with the new co-host she wants while sneaking around to undermine her by begging Alex to come back. And just where is Alex? Well, she had a big rush of \"what a feminist icon!\" publicity after speaking out about UBA, which you can tell from all the magazine covers about herself that she has spread out on a table in her home, which seems super normal, not weird at all, no sir. But she\\'s now retreated to Maine. She\\'s been writing her memoir (of course), and she lives in a picturesque house and splits her own wood, which is perhaps the most Cher-Horowitz-ian \"AS IF!\" moment of the episode. In effect, Alex is starring in her own revival of the Diane Keaton classic Baby Boom, minus the baby and the hot veterinarian. A Memo From The Department Of Author Veracity: It\\'s a shame that nobody ever really shows what it looks like when you\\'re writing a book, but I guess Jennifer Aniston probably wants to be seen with her hair washed and even Apple doesn\\'t have the budget for that many Diet Coke cans. When Cory shows up to beg Alex to return temporarily to TMS as part of a big deal with the network that would ultimately lead to a lot of other ... feminist icon projects? ... she says no. She doesn\\'t want to come back. But then Alex hits up her neighbor\\'s New Year\\'s Eve party and runs into a psychic played by Kathy Najimy, who intuits that she feels sad and guilty — after whiffing on the basics by intuiting that Alex\\'s parents are dead and she has a son. Now, one could ask why Alex would keep listening to a psychic who is unable to distinguish the dead from the living, and one could also suspect Kathy Najimy The Psychic of concluding Alex feels sad and guilty based on all those magazine articles about her. As it turns out, however, Alex is sad and guilty. Also, Maine is cold and she has no friends and she is probably very tired of splitting her own wood (AS IF!). So she calls Cory just as the ball is about to drop in Times Square, and she agrees to come back to UBA. Delighted, Cory kneecaps Stella by telling her that the deal she\\'s been busy negotiating is off, and hey, it\\'s going to be two white women at the anchor desk after all! Cory is in a state of weasel bliss about his successful end run around Stella, until he looks up at a news ticker and sees that Hannah\\'s parents — you remember Hannah (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who may have intentionally taken her own life after the network failed her six or eight times regarding Mitch\\'s sexual harassment — are suing UBA for wrongful death. Kathy Najimy plays a psychic who gets into the head of Alex (Jennifer Aniston) — eventually.  Oh, and as Cory stares miserably at that news? Somebody sneezes. New York City is now two months away from its first confirmed COVID case. Achoo! Here\\'s the question that hangs over this entire first episode: Why are we here? Not here watching this show — people watch things that are much worse than this with many fewer bright spots. What I mean is, who on this planet thought it would be a great idea to spend an entire season of this show reliving the onset of COVID? It\\'s some kind of weird apocalyptic nostalgia thing, like ... hey, remember realizing how bad it was? Remember being sent home from work if you were lucky? Remember new ring lights and hand-washing demos? Get ready to think about that stuff a lot more! Maybe Alex and Bradley can interview Tiger King! At first, it seems weird, but honestly, it\\'s very sad. I suspect that they conceived this season when it was clear that a vaccine was in sight, and they thought that by September 2021 when the season dropped, things would be going well. They thought we\\'d be doing better than we are. They thought we\\'d be feeling more ready to process it. Instead, this season is landing at what is, for a lot of people, not the most dangerous moment in this pandemic but certainly the most infuriating. So an invitation to look back on January through March of 2020 is like an invitation to a person who just got hit in the face with a tennis ball to look at an instant replay of being hit with that ball while also trying to avoid another ball. So I want to talk about this show this season, even if you\\'re not watching all of it. I want to talk about how they\\'re using celebrity, how they\\'re trying to capture shreds of the zeitgeist, why Steve Carell is still part of the show (he is!), and whether they have anything left to say about media or the #MeToo movement. But I also want to talk about how they shoot and light these people, how they dress them and do their hair, what music they use, and how they structure stories. Because in all its messiness, The Morning Show is a story about what television looks like at the moment.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston explains selling ‘The Morning Show’ when Apple TV+ ‘didn’t have walls‘', 'content': \"The Morning Show is one of the flagship Apple TV+ original shows, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and Steve Carell. In a new interview with Variety, Jennifer Aniston offers new details on working with Apple, the show’s inspiration, and more.  Aniston explains that Apple originally acquired The Morning Show based purely on an outline. Four months after that, however, real-world events including the rise of the Me Too movement forced the show to “start from scratch” with new inspiration drawn from those events. The show got picked up. We sold it to Apple with an outline. Then, about four months later, the whole s— hit the fan and, basically, we had to start from scratch. When it comes to working with Apple, Aniston says she had some early “reservations” because the company didn’t “have walls yet or telephones” for its original content efforts: Did you have any reservations selling “The Morning Show” to Apple? “Yes and no. But I have to say the “no” outweighed the “yes,” because we knew what we were doing — even though they didn’t have walls yet or telephones.” Aniston adds that Apple originally came to the Creative Artists Agency about acquiring the show – and that she was excited about being the first show at Apple: “There was really something exciting about being the first at Apple. Apple is pretty awesome. They make cool stuff. Why wouldn’t they maybe make cool television? And they are all about quality, not quantity, so that was really appealing. And in spite of their comical secrecy, it’s been worth it. Who doesn’t want to be part of the Wild Wild West?” Despite her involvement with The Morning Show, Aniston said that she’s “excited” and “shocked” about the state of streaming TV, but that certain aspects of it are sad: “I remember not understanding. What the hell does streaming mean? They’re like, “It’s there all the time.” So tuning in on Thursday nights at eight o’clock is not a thing anymore? Or you’re not going to the bathroom on a commercial break and someone yells, “It’s back on!” That doesn’t happen anymore? It’s kind of sad.” You can read the full interview at Variety for more about the creative side of the show. The Morning Show will premiere on Apple TV+ on November 1st.

GETTY IMAGES Jennifer Aniston is proving that balanced queens take breaks. The actress, who stars in The Morning Show, recently told People that ahead of the series\\'s season 3 premiere this fall, she plans to take a couple months off, and she\\'s going to utilize that downtime by traveling more. “In our business, you have to demand the time off or carve it out, because there\\'s always something that\\'s going to pop up. So I think after next week I\\'m going to take June and July off,” she told the outlet. “I\\'ve never done that, but I really think I\\'m going to do it. I’m going to travel because I haven\\'t really since the pandemic. I\\'ve become very insular. But it\\'s time to get over that, it’s very easy to fall into agoraphobia after this pandemic. And I refuse to let that happen.” JENNIFER ANISTON/INSTAGRAM Elsewhere in the interview, the actress also teased that the upcoming installment of the Apple TV+ series will be \"more sensual\" than past seasons. “It\\'s a good, juicy one,\" she said. \"Everybody\\'s getting in trouble. Everybody has a secret. And everyone\\'s just walking the line. It\\'s a lot more sensual this year.” The Friends alum also applies the same work hard, play hard sentiment to her workout routine to avoid burnout. She recently told InStyle that she has chosen to forgo the really intense 45 minute cardio workouts. \"I believed it for so long. I just burnt out and broke my body,\" she said. So, she became a Pvolve partner in order to find exercises that were a good medium between too challenging and too easy. \"You\\'re not thinking, or really getting a good workout, when you\\'re doing something over and over again,\" she added. \"After a workout, I don\\'t feel insane fatigue or broken or in pain.\" ', 'source_domain': 'www.instyle.com', 'url': 'https://www.instyle.com/jennifer-aniston-taking-summer-off-7509921', 'copyright': ''}\n",

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston on ‘The Morning Show’ Season 2 Finale and Cancel Culture: ‘It’s the New Sport’', 'content': ' [Editor’s Note: The following interview contains spoilers for “The Morning Show” Season 2, Episode 10, “Fever.”] “The Morning Show” has come a long way in two seasons. The Apple TV+ series begins by exposing Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) as a sexual predator, ousting the longtime anchor from his position next to co-host Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) and sending the show’s parent company into a tailspin. Investigations are launched. A toxic culture is uncovered. Replacement anchor Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) helps Alex divulge their findings live, on-air, in order to kickstart the rebuild by any means necessary. The sins of the past, which cost one colleague her life, cannot be allowed to fester in darkness. They have to start fresh with the truth. But throughout Season 2, Alex begins to question that assertion. Faced with a new tell-all book covering her time with Mitch on the “Morning Show,” complicated feelings about some of the people she turned her back on, and a return to the airwaves, the newfound #MeToo hero spends most of the 10 episodes in a state of panic.   Why? She’s terrified of getting “canceled.”  “[‘The Morning Show’] is all that [Alex] has,” Jennifer Aniston said in an interview with IndieWire. “She’s burned every bridge because all she cared about was that show and being on top and staying relevant and maintaining that level of Alex Levy-dom at any expense, to the point that she turned a blind eye on behavior that she should not have.” “When she gets back into the show, she naively thinks that she’s gained some wisdom and some self-reflection, and she can carry this newfound Alex back into the hallways of TMS,” Aniston said, “but then realizes there are so many bodies buried — then the book, and then this [and that]. It’s just, ‘Oh my gosh, how do I navigate that?’ She’s spent so much of her time trying to plug up all the holes in the canoe, so it doesn’t sink. It’s that desperation to not be found out — what an exhausting existence to have to live in.” In the finale, she has to face these struggles head-on. After Mitch’s death by suicide two episodes prior, Alex is reeling not only from her conflicted feelings for her former co-host (who she visited in Italy shortly before his death), but from public backlash over her decision to travel internationally during a global pandemic.   Then, of course, she’s diagnosed with COVID. “The Morning Show” Season 2 is set in the months leading up to the pandemic’s breakthrough in America, and Alex is among the first notable figures to contract the virus. (Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, who tested positive in March 2020, are also mentioned in the finale as famous early cases.) With a high fever, nausea, and more debilitating symptoms, she’s told to stay home, rest, and self-isolate by her doctors. But her producer, Chip (Mark Duplass), convinces Alex to share her plight with the world via an educational special shot live within her home. It’s their chance to show people what the disease looks like, and Alex’s opportunity to speak directly to a once-loyal audience who may be turning against her. So for the final third of Episode 10, Aniston speaks directly to camera, as Alex tries to come to terms with everything she’s gone through. To the recent outcry, she says, “The legions of people who want me gone, they’re not real — Maggie Brenner’s book is gonna sell 30 or 40,000 [copies] if she’s lucky, but I’m meant to believe the whole world is going to be outraged about my behavior?” Later, she asks her audience if they think she deserves to suffer like this, and if so, “What’s your point? Is it that if I deserve it, it allows you to enjoy someone else’s pain while feeling morally righteous? […] Why do you have an opinion on this? Mind your own store.” It’s hard to say if Alex is more worried about dying or getting canceled, but even equating the two is a major statement from “The Morning Show.” The season’s consistent focus on “cancel culture” paired with Alex’s ultimate conclusion — “I’m done apologizing for myself. Either get on the Alex Levy train or just stay at the station” — illustrates a resistance to the same kind of accountability the show argued for in Season 1. “Obviously, that’s a new thing that’s happening. It’s the new sport,” Aniston said when asked how heavily “being canceled” weighs on people like Alex. “It feels reckless, which is why I think we really wanted to explore it in the show. What happens when someone gets canceled? Where do they go? Is that it? Depending, of course, on the level of the crime: Some are obviously unthinkable, unforgivable acts that cannot be overlooked, and then some are just bad judgment, or there’s stuff being dug up from 20 years ago, when times were different and things that were normal are now, today, not normal. Everybody is navigating through, ‘What are we allowed to say?’ ‘What can you do now?’ ‘Oh, no no — you can’t say that.’ So there is a new playbook that everybody’s trying to catch up to.”   “But what was fun for me was to sort of realize that you can stick your head in the sand as much as you want, but eventually those bodies are going to get discovered,” she continued. “You can’t hide it forever. This is the world we live in, and yet at all costs, [Alex] is going to stay above [the fold]; she’s back to that thing — the drug got her again. She just has to stay afloat, hide it here, hide it there, and eventually it all just bites her in the ass.” How lasting the bitemarks should be remains the question. “The Morning Show” started as a series working to lay bare the dire consequences of sexual misconduct, discriminatory corporate culture, and unchecked power. It ends — at least with Season 2, since Apple TV+ has yet to order a third season — as a show unsure of how power should be scrutinized and who has the right to say enough is enough. Alex Levy will not be silenced. But audiences can still choose whether they want to listen. “The Morning Show” Seasons 1-2 are available to stream in full via Apple TV+.

It is the size of a boutique clothing store, with rows upon rows and aisles of clothes neatly hanging and organized by color and style The dark wood floors throughout are topped by modern closet dividers of blonde wood with black accents. The closet is just one part of the $21 million Bel-Air mansion that she shares with her three dogs.  Aniston has owned the home with fabulous views since 2011.  The very private star only occasionally reveals glimpses of her living spaces, which is why fans were excited to get an inside look at her private dressing area. The photos Jennifer posted on Instagram from her giant walk-in as she was preparing to attend the People's Choice Awards illustrate the insanity that takes place when preparing for a big night in front of national television cameras. Two assistants were helping her put a pair of strappy black shoes to go with her LBD (little black dress) that one of her fans described as a 'Tom Ford era Gucci dress.'

The Friends alum had debuted a new, shorter hair style at the Golden Globes on January 7, 2024; with some saying the new cut channeled the former 'Rachel' cut, which was created in the '90s for the sitcom.  However, side-by-side comparisons of the new cut versus the 'Rachel' cut show the new style as slightly longer and more sophisticated - an update for 2024. The People's Choice Awards were held on February 18, 2024, at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. Hosted by actor Simu Liu, the show was broadcast live simultaneously on NBC and E! and streamed live on Peacock. At the show, Aniston won the 'People's Drama TV Star' award for her acting work on 'The Morning Show' series. The award was presented to her by fellow actor on the series, Jon Hamm.

The actor revealed she’d suffered a dreaded fake tan fail while filming the new series of The Morning Show. Jen shared a series of snaps and videos from behind the scenes of the hit Apple TV+ show, which is currently in production of its third season. In one of the videos, she is seen with her feet in the sink as her friend tries to scrub away the orange colour she’d been left with after getting a spray tan. “Note to self, hands and feet you must lotion before a spray tan, otherwise... a situation,” she told her followers. Referring to her friend, Jen joked: “This is what love is.” The Morning Show is returning to Apple TV+ next year, and will see Jon Hamm  join the cast. The Hollywood actor will play corporate titan Paul Marks, who sets his sights on the fictional UBA News TV network. Jennifer is returning to the show alongside Reese Witherspoon and Billy Crudup, where her character – The Morning Show host Alex Levy – was last seen after contracting Covid-19 following her visit to see the now deceased Mitch Kessler, played by Steve Carell, in Italy.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The Morning Show season two review: Aniston and Witherspoon return – minus #MeToo', 'content': 'The first season’s Weinstein-esque plot pivot added emotional heft to TMS’s glossiness. But as we kick off again, Apple’s drama is back to fluff and empty monologues T\\nhe Morning Show (Apple TV+) is back! Which is to say, the version of The Morning Show we knew and had an amused contempt for when it landed in 2019 is back. As season two gets under way, the dramatic, serious switcheroo it pulled at the end of its first run has receded from memory. It has re-established itself as a glossy, soapy, inessential indulgence – a TV show about a TV show, made by people who think TV shows are more fascinating than they are. If all this is new, a recap: we began season one with Mitch (Steve Carell) – the co-anchor of the top-rated breakfast TV programme – losing his job over sexual misconduct claims. Beloved superstar Alex (Jennifer Aniston) was left to front a toxified entertainment brand alone, until mercurial news boss Cory (Billy Crudup) installed firebrand rookie Bradley (Reese Witherspoon) as the new co-host. A festival of scheming power plays and soul-searching crises followed. For a time, The Morning Show sashayed uncertainly across the screen, powered by bravado and star power. Its speciality was grandstanding speeches that had all the superficial qualities of award-worthy acting, without ever deviating into areas such as character development, plot or believable relationships. You wouldn’t have been surprised if you had found out the leads had never actually met and the whole thing had been made with doubles and green screens. That is, until episode eight, when a flashback revealed Mitch to be not just the womanising sleaze we had him pegged as, but a Weinsteinian predator. The scene between Carell and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, as a vulnerable young colleague too intimidated and bewildered to vocalise her lack of consent, changed the whole series in an instant. Suddenly, The Morning Show was a coldly focused treatise on how abusers are fostered by workplace hierarchies with misogynists at the top, and monsters hiding in plain sight. As in so many of the real #MeToo cases that The Morning Show drew on, the answer to the question of who knew what was happening was, sadly, everyone. In the finale, the death of one of Mitch’s victims prompted Alex and Bradley to unite and speak up, calling out their male superiors in a thrilling on-air exposé. What next? For now, it seems all of that might as well have never happened. As soon as TV’s most skippable opening titles sequence – bland jazz and dancing abstract circles, as if to announce that nobody really knows what this show is – rolls, we reset. Exposition, elegantly concealed within the dialogue like spanners in a trifle, brings us up to speed: with New Year’s Eve 2019/2020 approaching, it’s several months since Alex resigned and Cory was nearly sacked. The new-look TMS, hosted by Bradley and new guy Eric (Hasan Minhaj), is rating poorly. Mitch is out of the picture and Alex is snuggled up in a cabin in snowy Maine, writing her memoirs. In the studio, people once again powerwalk through corridors and make tough decisions about news agendas, as runners toss them flat whites and gossip pings in on their iPhone or their Apple Watch. Bradley, meanwhile, still doesn’t have a personality beyond being vaguely forthright and idealistic, as if she’s been written by someone who has seen a couple of old Reese Witherspoon movies, but can’t quite recall the details. That leaves the way clear – in season two, episode one – for Crudup to dominate the big monologues. He’s angry and righteous in the face of dinosaur executives. Then he’s untrustworthy but persuasive as he tries to convince Alex to come back to New York, which we know she will do because Jennifer Aniston isn’t paid $1m an episode to chop logs and wear big jumpers. After that, he’s frank and vulnerable as he deflects Bradley’s anger at once again being lied to about changes behind the scenes. None of it feels real. Without the storyline that gave The Morning Show all its power and nuance, we are left with the old luxury fluff, reacquainting ourselves with characters who aren’t substantial enough to merely hang out with. Some sort of reflective reckoning might be in the wind: Steve Carell – absent in the season opener – will return, with Julianna Margulies also on her way as a reporter asking whether the right lessons have been learned. However, if the ostentatious shot of a crew member sneezing is anything to go by, Covid might instead prompt a less subtle working of real world events into the narrative. This is a drama that demands we take it seriously – it needs to earn that right anew.

The drama centers on the staff of a network news program upended by the sexual misconduct of an anchor. It debuted in 2019 and returns Friday (new episodes streaming weekly). In the final minutes of the inaugural season, veteran co-host Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) and her co-anchor, Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon), outed UBA network President Fred Micklen (Tom Irwin) as an enabler of the sexual misconduct by Levy’s former desk mate Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), seemingly a stand-in for Matt Lauer of NBC\\'s \"Today.\"  \"Season 1 is more about the turmoil going on by the network that crescendos into this huge moment of change, and then where we begin at Season 2 is what happens after something that big at a workplace,\" Witherspoon says. \"Everyone got fired.

Alex ends up leaving the morning program. \"I don\\'t think she\\'s ever looked inside and asked these questions, but I think she is finally asking the hard questions: ‘Who am I? How did I get here?’\" Aniston says. \"The job was so No. 1, and all that she cared about, that everything kind of all fell by the wayside, and she\\'s just left pretty much alone. And the need to be relevant and the need to stay on top was so important that she just became complicit, and she turned a blind eye to things that she should not have turned a blind eye to, because it didn\\'t matter.\" The trailer for the coming season shows network executive Cory Ellison (Billy Crudup, who won an Emmy for the role) begging Alex to come back to \"The Morning Show.\" He pleads: \"You are the only thing that can save us.\" Ratings have taken a dive, and it seems viewers consider Bradley a flash in the pan.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'The Morning Show hits back at criticism with Jennifer Aniston sex scene', 'content': 'The morning news, but sexy. The Morning Show spoilers follow. The sixth episode of the \\'more money than sense\\' Apple TV+ series The Morning Show finally gives us a break from the ripped-from-the-headlines storytelling of recent weeks. Instead, the episode \\'The Stanford Student\\' offers something resembling the inner machinations of a believable morning news programme. The hour revolves around Jon Hamm\\'s Elon Musk-alike Paul Marks as he wolfishly charms his way through an interview with Jennifer Aniston\\'s Katie Couric stand-in Alex Levy. But wait! There\\'s more! We finally cash in on Hamm and Aniston\\'s legitimately sparky chemistry, from the moment Paul runs into a scene dripping wet in surf gear and a hilariously nervous Alex stutters \"Oh – you\\'re not dressed.\" There\\'s then some tongue-in-cheek confusion over the \"turn on\" to his house. It\\'s gloriously frothy. Ahead of their sit-down interview and under the shimmer of the box lighting, Paul gets a lingering look at Alex\\'s toned, exposed midriff and turns hot under his gaping collar. Meanwhile, to the side, Alex\\'s long-obsessed producer Chip starts pulling a series of tragic hangdog looks, which gradually morph into a gaze of murderous intent as he sees the erotic writing on the wall. Their interview is genuinely gripping and, for once, doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s solely been cobbled together from a series of hot take-y tweets. To cap off what\\'s already shaping up to be a dazzling episode in a fairly lacklustre season, Hamm and Aniston\\'s characters succumb to that crackling chemistry and we get an extremely softly-lit sex scene. The waves gently lapping outside the Hamptons bedroom are the uncharted waters we\\'ve now waded into. Like all silver linings, there is still a drab cloud to cast a pall over proceedings. Bradley Jackson (played by Reese Witherspoon, but unable to harness any of the actor\\'s raw charm) sees her brother Hal (Joe Tippet) back on the scene, reminding us that this drama contains one of the most unlikable characters ever to grace our screens. Yet this episode\\'s soapy, sexy peek into the world of morning news is even more welcome off the back of last week\\'s chaotic instalment: an episode inexplicably titled \\'Love Island\\'. The creative decisions only got more baffling from there. We were hauled back to the truly dismal early days of the coronavirus pandemic where the second season left off, back when Bradley ran through an intensive-care ward maskless (!) in search of that wretched brother. If we thought the third outing of The Morning Show had the good sense to skip on from there, in favour of a time period that made viewers less inclined to switch the thing off, we were proven terribly wrong. The fifth episode gave us first a 2020 supercut in all its horrific splendour, before jumping forward to the January 6 insurrection, to rehash that too. We learned that Bradley single-handedly documented the rioters, this time at least wearing a mask of sorts, and with her Apple TV+ mandated iPhone no less. Is there anything those phones can\\'t do? But while inside the Capitol filming a rioter beating the living daylights out of a police officer, his mask slipped down to reveal… Hal, confirming he is indeed one of the most unlikeable characters etc., etc. But beyond triggering a theoretical conversation about whether someone among us has a sibling good enough to delete the incriminating January 6 footage of them, what was the point of any of this? The Morning Show creative team has described that flashback episode as crucial to the piece. \"It was a very smart device to go back into Covid and to what led Bradley Jackson to her storyline,\" director and executive producer Mimi Leder told The Hollywood Reporter. \"We hope that we’ve gained some perspective on these events and what they meant to ourselves and the country, and hopefully the audience will have a similar experience.\" Okay… But have they gained said perspective on these events? The Morning Show is certainly no stranger to using the headlines to source storylines, but while shows like Succession demonstrate how current events can be refracted to shrewd effect, unfortunately this show has no such insight to shed. One of the side plot digressions in that fifth episode was the death of George Floyd, which prompted one character to ask tearfully: \"Do you think this country will ever change?\" It\\'s hand-wringing as storytelling. While The Morning Show has taken upon itself the task of Collective Trauma Processing Machine, that impulse feels more and more misguided with each issue-based season that passes. Seismic events like the US insurrection are still creating ripple effects as these episodes air, begging the question of whether it really needs to be used as the backdrop to tease out a grim dysfunctional sibling dynamic. What\\'s unfortunate is that the latest sparkling episode proves that there is a fun show here. It might not have the grand ambitions of a commuter space launch, but there\\'s no shame in that. What we\\'re hungry for is what The Morning Show just showed it can serve up par excellence – a glimpse into the gossipy, provocative world of television. Look at the intrigue around the revelations of Phillip Schofield\\'s workplace relationship earlier this year or the similarly breathless coverage of Holly Willoughby\\'s exit from This Morning or, across the pond, the fallout when two Good Morning America hosts were found to be having an affair. This is what viewers are morbidly fascinated in when it comes to morning news television, alongside those zany interview segments with the girl who wants to replace Big Ben\\'s bongs, of course. In a media ecosystem where people are looking up the news headlines on TikTok, it\\'s just not hugely credible that any of The Morning Show\\'s (the show within the show) coverage would even matter all that much. The biggest spikes in daytime television viewership always hit when those shows become the story themselves. The prospect of an Alex, Paul and Chip love triangle is sufficient enough to have us tuning in to next week\\'s episode. But we do know that the back half of the season includes the team\\'s response to the overturning of Roe v Wade, so we may still not be out of the treacly, preachy realm of a dramatised Apple News app just yet.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston Is Selling Bel Air Mansion Where She Married Justin Theroux (Exclusive)', 'content': '                                                                Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are saying goodbye — to their marriage and their dream home. The couple announced in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15, that they called it quits on their two-year union, and now a source tells Us Weekly exclusively that the former Friends star, 49, is selling the Bel Air house where she married the Leftovers alum, 46, in 2015.  “She bought the mansion and it underwent extensive renovations. That is what Jen does: Buys houses, renovates and then sells for a huge profit,” the insider says. “The mansion is going to be a pocket listing, and if it doesn’t sell that way, it will be listed on the open market. She is ready to find the next project, and has been searching for a while.” Aniston recently showed off the midcentury abode, which she purchased in 2011, in Architectural Digest’s March 2018 issue. She told the magazine that renovations became somewhat of a passion project over the years. “There was a time when I thought there was something romantic about picking up and trotting off somewhere different every three months. Now I’m becoming more particular about the projects I take,” the actress explained. “I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there’s nowhere else I want to be.” Aniston and Theroux tied the knot during an intimate ceremony in their backyard in August 2015. Guests included her Friends costars Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow, as well as Jason Bateman, Sandra Bullock and Ellen DeGeneres.  Two years later, the couple announced that they had come to a mutual decision to split at the end of 2017. “We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship,” they said in a joint statement to Us on Thursday, adding that they are “determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.” With reporting by Jennifer Heger.

Broadly hailed as a “masterpiece” and one of the best films of the year, “Killers of the Flower Moon” has been honored as the Best Film of the Year by the National Board of Review, named to the American Film Institute's list of Motion Pictures of the Year and landed 12 Critics Choice Award nominations. The film has also been named to the American Film Institute's list of Motion Pictures of the Year, and landed 12 Critics Choice Award nominations.

Supporting actor Robert De Niro has been recognized for his performance by the National Board of Review, the Critics Choice Awards, the Golden Globes and many more. These nominations are the latest in a string of accolades for global phenomenon “Ted Lasso,” this year’s most Emmy-nominated comedy for the third consecutive year with 21 nods in total, including Best Comedy and multiple performance nods. In 2022, “Ted Lasso” joined the ranks of comedy legends with its win for Outstanding Comedy Series for its first and second seasons, becoming only the eighth series in the genre in 74 years of Emmy history to do so. The second season of “Ted Lasso” was also the most Emmy-winning comedy for the second year in a row with four total wins, including Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series (Jason Sudeikis), Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Brett Goldstein) and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series (M.J.

The SAG Award nomination for widely acclaimed limited series “Lessons in Chemistry” expands recent honors for the series including multiple nominations from the Critics Choice Awards, Golden Globes, DGA Awards, Film Independent Spirit Awards and Hollywood Make-Up Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards, among many others. To date, Apple Original films, documentaries and series have earned 638 wins and 1,836 award nominations and counting, including multi-Emmy Award-winning comedy “Ted Lasso” and historic Oscar Best Picture winner “CODA.” In total, Apple received 11 SAG Award nominations today, including: “Killers of the Flower Moon” is set at the turn of the 20th century, when oil brought a fortune to the Osage Nation, who became some of the richest people in the world overnight. The wealth of these Native Americans immediately attracted white interlopers, who manipulated, extorted and stole as much Osage money as they could before resorting to murder. Based on a true story and told through the improbable romance of Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie Kyle (Gladstone), “Killers of the Flower Moon” is an epic western crime saga, where real love crosses paths with unspeakable betrayal. Also starring De Niro and Jesse Plemons, “Killers of the Flower Moon” is directed by Scorsese from a screenplay by Eric Roth and Scorsese, based on David Grann’s bestselling book. Set in the early 1950s, “Lessons in Chemistry” follows Elizabeth Zott (played by Larson), whose dream of being a scientist is put on hold in a patriarchal society. When Elizabeth finds herself fired from her lab, she accepts a job as a host on a TV cooking show, and sets out to teach a nation of overlooked housewives — and the men who are suddenly listening — a lot more than recipes. “The Morning Show” explores the cutthroat world of morning news and the lives of the people who help America wake up in the morning. Along with Witherspoon and Aniston, the star-studded season three ensemble cast is led by Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Jon Hamm, Nicole Beharie and Julianna Margulies. In season three, the future of the network is thrown into question and loyalties are pushed to the brink when a tech titan takes an interest in UBA. Unexpected alliances form, private truths are weaponized and everyone is forced to confront their core values both in and out of the newsroom. Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, a small-time college football coach from Kansas hired to coach a professional soccer team in England, despite having no experience. But what he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog determination and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Goldstein, Phil Dunster and Nick Mohammed. In addition to starring, Sudeikis serves as executive producer, alongside Bill Lawrence via his Doozer Productions, in association with Warner Bros. and Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive producer, with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Hunt and Joe Kelly, and is based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports. All series are currently streaming on Apple TV+. “Killers of the Flower Moon” from Scorsese, will be available to stream globally on Apple TV+ beginning Friday, January 12.

      "{'authors': '', 'date': '', 'title': 'Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt Are All Smiles During First On-Screen Reunion Since Divorce', 'content': 'We earn a commission for products purchased through some links in this article. We\\'ve only just recovered from the SAG awards... The full video of Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matthew McConaughey and more, reading Fast Times At Ridgemont High for charity, has now been shared online. The impressive group of A-listers came together to raise money for a good cause and it marked the first on-screen reunion for former spouses Aniston and Pitt. Those still devastated by the 90s/00s dream couple\\'s marital split will be thrilled to learn that among the many actors who joined in the table read, the couple actually shared a scene together and a fairly graphic one at that. Aniston voiced the character Linda while Pitt played Brad, appropriately, which required the two to act out a scene in which Brad gets caught masturbating by Linda. Aniston and Pitt were true professionals reading out the potentially awkward scene, which was being narrated by Morgan Freeman, while their fellow cast members smirked in unison at the scene. Honestly, watch this former married couple nail the scene at around the 36-minute mark, involving Aniston saying: \\'Hi Brad, you know how cute I always thought you were? I think you\\'re so sexy, will you come to me?\\' as part of Brad\\'s fantasy: Other highlights in the video includes Chrissy Teigen popping up to see what her husband John Legend is up to, before being stunned at the display of famous faces on the laptop screen. Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt reunited online for the first time since their split for a table read of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. The former couple were seen embracing in January backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards after Pitt won a gong for Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. The last time the pair were seen on screen together was when they worked together in 2001 for the Friends episode The One With The Rumour. However, the 50-year-old and 56-year-old - who were married from 2000 until 2005 – joined forces with a bevvy of celebrities earlier this summer for a charity event which will air on September 17. Its initial release date was pushed back from August 20. For the virtual reunion, the stars joined Morgan Freeman, Dane Cook, Henry Golding, Shia LaBeouf, Matthew McConaughey, Jimmy Kimmel, Julia Roberts, John Legend, Ray Liotta and Sean Penn. Proceeds from the show will go toward Penn\\'s nonprofit CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort) and REFORM Alliance. In August, actor Cook said it was Aniston who was the first star to sign up to the table read. ‘I think Jennifer Aniston was lovely and the first person to say, \"I’m in,\" and then it just started to rocket after that,’ he told Extra. The original Fast Times at Ridgemont High was released in a 1982 American as a coming-of-age teen dramedy film starring Penn. Original article published on 18/8/29: Cast your minds back to January, 2020.  Coronavirus (or, so we thought and were told) appeared to be a distant threat, we were in a post-Christmas haze looking forward to all the fun we were going to have this year and Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt reunited and held hands at the SAG awards filling the hearts of many still not over their 2005 split. All in all, a better time. Well, in good news for those still devastated by the end of one of the 90s\\' greatest love stories, the actors are set to team up again for a virtual table read. The former spouses will join Jimmy Kimmel, Matthew McConaughey, Julia Roberts, Henry Golding, Morgan Freeman and Sean Penn in an unrehearsed reading of the 1982 film Fast Times at Ridgemont High, reports Entertainment Tonight. The live read-through will be broadcast on the charity CORE\\'s social media pages in September, with those tuning in urged to make donations as they watch. CORE is a disaster relief organisation co-founded by Penn, who starred in the original movie, in the wake of the 2011 Haiti earthquake and is currently fundraising for Covid-19 relief. While Aniston and Pitt\\'s SAG awards moment, shown after they both won awards for The Morning Show and Once Upon A Time In... Hollywood respectively, was the first time the public have seen them together in the 15 years since their split, it is believed they have slowly been rebuilding their friendship over the past couple of years.
