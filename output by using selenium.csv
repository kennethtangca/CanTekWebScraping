,Democrats Are Trailing Everywhere But at the Ballot Box,"     THE REPORT Democrats aren’t getting a lot of encouraging news from 2024 opinion polls these days. But elections are painting a much different picture.  ALEX BRANDON|AP President Joe Biden pauses as a protester interrupts him at an event on the campus of George Mason University in Manassas, Va., on Jan. 23, 2024. The media narrative is grim for president Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats: Biden's too old and his mental acuity is questionable, sayeth the pundits and the polls. Democratic base voters, particularly Black voters, are disenchanted with the president, leading a generally cranky Democratic rank-and-file to stay home this November. Actual elections, however, paint a much different picture. Democrats scored a big win in New York on Tuesday, and the numbers were extremely encouraging for the party. Not only did Democrats add a seat to their caucus in Washington, but it wasn't even close: Tom Suozzi, a former House member who reclaimed his old job, beat Republican Mazi Pilip by 8 percentage points – a 16-point swing from 15 months ago, when former GOP Rep. George Santos took the district by 8 percentage points. Across the country, Democrats are winning special elections and overperforming in elections they have predictably lost. And it's fueling optimism among Democrats looking at a challenging election year for both the White House and Congress. ""Polls don't vote. People vote. And that's what's been happening,"" says Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, a veteran lawmaker from Massachusetts who has served in both the minority and the majority. Despite what the polls say, ""people have been voting, and they've been voting Democratic. I feel really good about November – and not just about the president. I feel really good about us taking back the House."" Experts caution that a special election win in New York – particularly a district Biden won in 2020, albeit when the district was drawn to be more Democratic-friendly – does not a national movement make. The president still has abysmally low approval ratings, and national and battleground state polls show him in a tight race with his likely fall opponent, former President Donald Trump. ""I think that Democrats would be making a lot of assumptions if they, A, took their great joy from this result as some sort of bellwether for November or, B, thought there was some kind of playbook that came out of it"" to win races in districts in other parts of the country, says Syracuse University professor Grant Reeher. In a 2022 election season when Democrats did surprisingly well, they fared poorly in blue New York, Reeher notes, losing four congressional seats to Republicans. Tuesday's special election could just be the state returning to its mostly Democratic roots, he says. And the immigration issue – which Democrats are trying to seize as their own, focusing on House Republicans' refusal to consider a bipartisan border security package negotiated by the Senate – remains a vulnerability for both Biden and congressional Democrats. But the numbers that matter – performances in contests ranging from mayoral and state legislative races to presidential primaries – give still-nervous Democrats reason to hope. In the past year, Republicans lost the mayoral races in both ruby-red Colorado Springs, Colorado (where an independent newcomer, Yemi Mobolade, became the city's first Black mayor), and in Jacksonville, Florida, where Democrat Donna Deegan's win erased Jacksonville's distinction as the largest U.S. city with a Republican mayor.  In November, Democrats flipped the Virginia state House, gained seats in the New Jersey state legislature, held onto the governorship in deep red Kentucky, and won city council and school board races across the country. Last month, Democrats picked up a critical state House seat in Orlando, Florida – an important indicator of political mood in the I-4 corridor, home to many Hispanics. Nationally, Democrats are outpacing Republicans in voter registration, going from trailing the GOP in September (28% Republican registration and 24% Democratic registration) to leading in January (27% Democratic registration versus 25% Republican registration), according to Gallup. Tuesday was a big night for Democrats as well. Not only did Suozzi shrink the GOP's already whisper-thin majority in the House with his win in New York, but Democrat Jim Prokopiak ensured Democratic control of Pennsylvania’s state House with a blowout 68%-32% win over Republican Candace Cabanas in a race predicted to be much closer. The win was the sixth special election victory for Democrats in Pennsylvania, allowing them to retain control of a chamber they flipped in 2022. Even where Democrats lost, they gained ground. Tuesday night in Oklahoma, the Democratic candidate lost a state House seat by 5 percentage points, though Trump won the deeply conservative district by 18 percentage points in 2020. That doesn't necessarily translate into support for Biden, experts note, since the president often polls lower than Democrats running for lower office. In the New York 3rd District race Suozzi won this week, for example, a Siena College poll taken the week before the election had Suozzi 4 percentage points ahead but Trump beating Biden by 5 percentage points. Still, presidential primary results suggest a stronger footing for Biden, even with the low turnout typical of a primary with an incumbent president running. Biden won the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate, garnering 64% of the vote without having campaigned or advertised in the state because of Democratic National Committee rules. In South Carolina, Biden's win with 96% of the vote was not unexpected. But after a slew of polls showing Black voters are unenthusiastic about Biden, the Palmetto State – which propelled Biden to the nomination in 2020 – indicated otherwise. Black voters, who comprised 56% of the early vote in the 2020 primary, made up 76% of that vote this year, the Biden campaign said. In Nevada, both Biden and Trump had only nominal opposition in their respective contests (a primary for Biden and caucuses for Trump), but Biden got nearly twice as many votes as did Trump – who wrongly claimed the turnout for the GOP caucuses was a record. While caucuses do tend to have lower turnouts than primaries, the difference was stark. Democrats still have a tough road ahead, and a series of issues – immigration, Biden's age and Trump's trials – could move the needle either way. ""I'm bullish on the House,"" says Rep. Steven Horsford, Nevada Democrat who heads the Congressional Black Caucus, saying his caucus – unlike the GOP – is ""unified."" But ""we have work to do,"" he adds.

,"Biden loses ground with young voters, prompting Dem concerns","Democrats are raising concerns that President Biden’s standing among young voters is in jeopardy after polling released this week showed Biden effectively tied with former President Trump among young voters.  A New York Times/Siena College survey released Monday showed Biden virtually tied with Trump among voters younger than 30, with 30 percent backing Biden and 29 percent backing Trump. Thirty-four percent said they backed independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Meanwhile, an Emerson College poll released last month found 45 percent of voters younger than 30 backing Trump, while 43 percent said they supported Biden. The latest data is surprising, given Biden’s victory over Trump among young voters in 2020. According to AP VoteCast, Biden won 61 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29. “Young people as we know have always been fiercely independent,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics. “It’s a more cynical electorate with God knows how many more independent candidacies, which on the youth cohort are more likely to hurt Biden more than Trump.”   The polling comes as Biden has faced backlash among young voters and activists for his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.   Earlier this week, several progressive groups, including March for Our Lives, GenZ For Change, and the Sunrise Movement, penned an open letter to Biden, warning his handling of the Israel-Hamas War could depress turnout among Millennial and Generation Z voters come next year.   “We write to you to issue a very stark and unmistakable warning: you and your Administration’s stance on Gaza risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year,” the letter read.   Progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reiterated the same sentiment in an interview on CNN.   “The primary concern for everybody is the status of Palestinians and the human rights, as well as Israelis too, the safety in the region,” Ocasio-Cortez told the network. “So I try not to look at this through an electoral lens but through what the right thing to do is. But I think it’s certainly something that is, that should be top of mind when it comes to the Democratic coalition.”  When asked about the latest polling showing Biden seemingly in a slump with young voters, however, Democrats point to what they see as the pivotal role young voters played in Tuesday’s off-year elections.   “If you want to see how people are going to vote, look at how they are voting,” said Jack Lobel, spokesperson for the Gen Z group Voters of Tomorrow. “On Tuesday, we saw young voters turn out in Virginia and in Ohio and in Kentucky and vote for President Biden’s ideology.”   Democrats also say polls and predictions have missed the mark on young voter turnout in the past.   “The polls for the last several years on young voters have missed the mark every single time. We just had an election, and we were told right before the election that young people were probably not going to vote as overwhelmingly Democratic or turn out at the rates they did,” said Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, president of the youth voting organization NextGen America.   “We’re not riding the pollercoaster,” she continued. “We’re doing the hard organizing work to make sure that young voters turnout and young voters are overwhelmingly progressive.”   “I don’t think this poll is reflective of the political reality that has played out every single election post-2016,” she added.  Ramirez pointed to top motivators for young Democratic-leaning voters, including climate change, student debt relief and a Trump candidacy.   “In 2020, Joe Biden was not the youth vote candidate, it’s true,” she said. “But what we saw is that young people did turn out and vote for him overwhelmingly, and they did it also in repudiation of Donald Trump and also for progressive policy.”  And Democrats are quick to note the recent poll numbers are not about Trump gaining ground with young voters, but rather Biden losing ground.  “I think it’s that Biden has taken a big hit with younger voters and is just not top of mind and I think that there is a restlessness that’s sort of playing. But I do not think that this is a move toward Trump by young voters by any stretch of the imagination,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist.   Reinish predicted young voters will ultimately choose Biden over Trump again, assuming Trump gets the nomination, pointing to their stances on climate change, abortion and democracy.   Della Volpe said it was critical for the Biden administration and campaign to continue to communicate their stances and accomplishments on these issues in an effort to win young voters over.   “It’s going to be important for members of the Biden-Harris team to constantly communicate the positive change in the country based upon youth participation,” he said, citing issues like climate investments, diversity in government and bipartisan gun legislation.   Still, Biden has faced questions over his age and whether that will ultimately be a factor in voter enthusiasm for his campaign.   An AP-NORC poll released in August found that 77 percent of voters younger than 45 said they thought Biden was too old to serve as president effectively. Among Democrats aged 18 to 29 years old, 76 percent said they believed Biden was too old to run for president.   However, Democratic activists argued it is Biden’s ideology rather than age that will be the biggest factor.  “President Biden being 80 years old does not matter to me how I live my life,” said Lobel, who is 19 and voting in his first presidential election next year. “Him investing in my education, in my future as a person who’s going to inherit this world, this economy, this climate, this matters to me.”   “As a 19-year-old, these are the numbers I care about, not his age,” he said.

,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?," Some Pennsylvania voters say President Biden’s warning that Donald Trump threatens U.S. democracy is not reaching beyond Democratic voters. Some Democratic voters say Trump is a threat and hold him responsible for the events of January 6, 2021. (Feb 17) (AP Video: Mike Rubinkam) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there.  “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Raymond Santiago, executive director, Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley, poses for a photo during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. Evelyn Fermin speaks during an interview, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” Curt Balch poses for a photo in Hellertown, Penn. on Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Christian Miller speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. Anna Kodama speaks during an interview, Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. President Joe Biden is warning that Donald Trump will be a grave threat to American democracy if he wins re-election, but interviews Pennsylvania voters again suggest it’s not resonating. Kodak said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem Chapter of the NAACP, talks about the presidential election in Bethlehem, Penn., Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Laurence Kesterson) Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. Guillermo Lopez Jr. speaks during an interview Thursday, Jan. 18, 2024, in Bethlehem, Penn. (AP Photo/Chris Szagola) “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

"2019, Thomas began singing a decidedly different tune. Justices’ pay was by then keeping up with inflation, but it hadn’t increased significantly. But in June, when asked about the court’s salaries, Thomas said, “Oh goodness, I think it’s plenty.”",Biden’s Young Voter Problem Just Got Even Worse,"Young voters are proving decidedly less interested in a 2024 Biden win than they were four years ago. A New York Times/Siena College poll published Tuesday indicates that most young voters are leaning toward voting for Donald Trump, with the indicted former president pulling 49 percent of the vote from constituents aged 18 to 29, with Biden at just 43 percent. That’s a stark contrast from July, when young voters preferred Biden by as much as 10 percentage points. The difference is likely due to the president’s handling of the conflict in Gaza, in which Biden has been a staunch ally to Israel. That’s resulted in a 72 percent disapproval rating within the same age bracket, according to the poll. However, faced with Trump on the other side of the ballot, those voters say they may be more likely to stay home than turn up to the voting booths. “I don’t want to vote for someone who is not aligned with my own personal values, as Biden has shown he is not when it comes to Gaza,” Colin Lohner, a 27-year-old software engineer in San Francisco, told The New York Times. “Do I vote for Biden or do I not vote at all? That’s really difficult, because if I don’t vote for Biden, I open up the possibility that Trump will win, and I really do not want that.” So far, the conflict has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians and displaced 1.9 million people living in the Gaza Strip—roughly 90 percent of its population—since the war began on October 7. The dwindling poll numbers are an alarming difference for the beleaguered president, who needed the support of young and minority voters to clinch his 2020 bid for the White House. Biden has voiced his own concern, reportedly marking his favorability ratings as a known issue in a closed-door White House meeting with top aides the day before Thanksgiving. At the time, Biden was neck and neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. And yet, the president is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president in a national survey, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote against Trump’s 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Donald Trump’s lawyers are trying to prevent an expert witness from testifying in his upcoming defamation trial against writer E. Jean Carroll. In a fun twist, the expert witness is the same woman who helped set massive damages for Rudy Giuliani. A federal judge ruled in September that Trump is liable for defaming Carroll in 2019 and owes her monetary damages. The exact amount will be set during the trial, which will begin in January. Trump’s lawyers filed a motion on Wednesday asking presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan to bar Ashlee Humphreys, a Northwestern University marketing professor who analyzes social media trends, from testifying against the former president next month. In the court documents, lawyer Michael Madaio argued that the damages estimates Humphreys had previously submitted were too high. “The damages estimations in her initial report are egregiously inflated (to the tune of millions of dollars), utilize methods which ascribe harm in an unreliable and incorrect manner; and do not accurately reflect the actual harm to plaintiff’s reputation,” Madaio wrote. Madaio took particular issue with the fact that Humphreys had initially included estimates for alleged damage caused by three different comments Trump made. Carroll is no longer suing over one of those statements, but Madaio argued Humphreys had not adjusted her estimate accordingly. Carroll’s lawyer hit back Monday, pointing out that Humphreys had indeed accounted for the change in estimated damages in a supplemental report. “Trump is understandably desperate to get rid of Professor Humphreys,” Roberta Kaplan (no relation to the judge) wrote in a filing asking to reject Trump’s request. “That Professor Humphreys recently testified in another case that resulted in a $108 million defamation verdict likely adds to Trump’s sense of urgency.” Kaplan was referring to the defamation case against Giuliani. The former Trump lawyer was found liable in August for defaming Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. On Friday, Giuliani was ordered to pay the women a whopping $148 million in damages. Humphreys testified against Giuliani on December 13, the same day Trump’s lawyers filed the motion to bar her from appearing at the Carroll trial. Her testimony was pivotal in determining the exact amount of damages he owed. Humphreys is no stranger to Carroll’s case against Trump. The Northwestern professor already testified in Carroll’s first defamation lawsuit against the former president. In May, a jury unanimously found Trump liable for sexual abuse and battery against Carroll in the mid-1990s and for defaming her in 2022 while denying the assault. He was ordered to pay her $5 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s estimates. Carroll’s second lawsuit is for comments Trump made in 2019, when he said she made up the rape allegation to promote her memoir. Judge Kaplan ruled that since Trump has already been found liable for sexual abuse, his 2019 comments are by default defamatory. Carroll is now seeking up to $12 million in damages, based on Humphreys’s recommendation. Clearly $148 million in legal penalties isn’t punishment enough for Rudy Giuliani, who took to Newsmax’s airwaves on Monday to vent even more defamatory lies about Georgia poll workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. “Your initial allegations, do you still believe them to be true?” asked host Rob Schmitt. “Yeah. Well, of course they’ll sue me again when I say that, but yeah, I do,” Giuliani said. “But they want me to lie. They, basically, they are suing me in order to lie to them.” “If I showed you the evidence right now, and I think you’ve played it on your air, people would see that what I said was absolutely true,” he said. Unfortunately for the former federal prosecutor, claiming that people made him lie may not be the concrete defense he hopes it to be. .@RudyGiuliani on defamation ruling: ""It's a fascist system run by the Biden regime; they turned the court system into a two-tiered system of justice."" @SchmittNYC pic.twitter.com/4FFY3fooqy Before last week’s judgment, Giuliani repeated election lies that he had previously admitted were untrue mere steps outside the courthouse, resulting in a wrist slap by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, who warned that it could result in more defamation charges for the broke fixer. And despite repeated promises to provide evidence on his debunked allegations, when the time came to finally take the stand and make “definitively clear” that what he said about the pair of workers was true, Giuliani opted not to. Freeman and Moss originally sought $24 million each in damages after the former New York City mayor accused them of manipulating ballots—claims that transformed into months of harassment, death threats, and protesters at their doorsteps. Instead, the jury decided they deserve far more. On Friday, a court ruled that the mother-daughter duo would receive $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages from the former Trump attorney. On Monday, the pair hit Giuliani with another lawsuit seeking a gag order and to permanently bar America’s disgraced mayor from continuing to trash-talk them. That new suit is based entirely on baseless claims that Giuliani made over the weekend, including some statements allowed to air on Newsmax, according to the legal complaint. “Are they actually going to put a gag on me while I walk around?” Giuliani joked on air. If there’s one thing you can count on Republicans for, it’s to tepidly push back on Donald Trump’s most vile comments. Trump drilled down harder than ever on fascist language during two weekend speeches. On Saturday, he said immigrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” The next day, he promised to use federal law enforcement funds to combat a “military invasion” at the southern border. But when asked about his comments late Monday, Republican senators had only the mildest of rebukes. “I obviously don’t agree with that. I mean, we’re all children of immigrants,” Senator Shelley Moore Caputo told Politico, somehow managing to “All Lives Matter” immigration. Senator Roger Wicker said he “certainly wouldn’t have said that,” and Senator Thom Tillis called Trump’s words “unhelpful.” Senators John Kennedy and Todd Young declined to comment, although Young joked he was “looking forward to another year of answering these questions.” “Drugs, criminals, gang members, and terrorists are pouring into our country at record levels. We’ve never seen anything like it. They’re taking over our cities,” Trump said over the weekend. He then promised to “shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement, including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.” No GOP senators have called for Trump to apologize. Their lukewarm stance should come as no surprise, though. This is a familiar tune for Republican lawmakers. Throughout Trump’s presidency, Republicans regularly evaded questions about his inflammatory rhetoric. Lawmakers would say they hadn’t seen the former president’s posts on social media or during speeches. Sometimes they would say they disagreed with his stance; other times they would quietly adopt his position. In fact, Republicans were perfectly happy to let Trump’s words slide so long as he continued to give them what they wanted in terms of policy and judicial appointments. This has continued since Trump left office, for instance last November, when Trump met with white supremacist Nick Fuentes and antisemite Kanye West. No members of Republican leadership ever explicitly condemned the meeting. Some lawmakers even tried to claim that Trump didn’t know who he was meeting or that he had condemned Fuentes’s previous comments. The Georgia election workers that Rudy Giuliani defamed sued the former Trump attorney again on Monday for continuing to make defamatory statements about them. Giuliani was found liable in August for defaming Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss, after he accused the pair of manipulating ballots in Georgia during the 2020 election. The two women have been subjected to months of harassment and death threats. A judge ordered Giuliani on Friday to pay Freeman and Moss nearly $150 million in damages last week. Freeman and Moss filed a fresh defamation lawsuit against Giuliani Monday for refusing to take a hint. “Defendant Giuliani continues to spread the very same lies for which he has already been held liable in the Freeman I action,” the lawsuit said, referring to the previous case. In fact, on December 15, “just hours after the jury in Freeman I returned a $148 million verdict against him, Defendant Giuliani appeared from Washington, D.C. for a live interview on Newsmax, in which he repeatedly asserted, either directly or at minimum by implication, that he was in possession of video evidence demonstrating the truth of his allegations against Plaintiffs.” Giuliani has already admitted that he made false statements about Freeman and Moss. In a July court filing, he acknowledged that his “statements carry meaning that is defamatory.” At the time, he insisted he only made that concession to move the lawsuit forward. Except he moved it forward right to a ruling of liability. And on Friday, a jury decided he owed the mother and daughter $148 million: $16 million each in damages for defamation, $20 million each for emotional distress, and another $75 million in punitive damages. Monday’s lawsuit is only seeking to bar Giuliani from making or repeating any more false claims about Freeman and Moss. The women have also requested he pay their legal fees for the new suit, but they are not asking for further financial damages. That could be because Giuliani is so hard up for cash that he will likely struggle to make the payments from Friday’s ruling. Giuliani has begun representing himself in court to save some cash. The man once affectionately known as “America’s mayor” is scrambling to find the money for all his legal fees and even listed his Manhattan apartment for sale in July. In August, after he was indicted in Georgia, Giuliani asked his social media followers to donate to his defense fund. He also flew to Mar-a-Lago to beg his boss Donald Trump to pay him for working as Trump’s personal attorney. That didn’t work, but Trump did agree to host a fundraiser dinner for Giuliani. Entry cost: $100,000 a plate. What’s more, people keep suing him for money owed. Several of Giuliani’s former lawyers, including his longtime attorney Robert Costello, have sued Giuliani for failing to pay their legal fees. Meanwhile, Giuliani’s ex-wife says he owes her more than $260,000 for her country club memberships, condominium fees, and health care as part of their divorce settlement. Giuliani narrowly avoided jail time over that lawsuit in December. And one of Giuliani’s former associates sued him in May, accusing him of promising to pay her a $1 million annual salary but instead sexually harassing and abusing her over two years. Joe Biden is finally fed up with his second-rate polling numbers. The night before the president took off to celebrate Thanksgiving, he gathered his closest aides in the White House to talk about a game plan for his tanking numbers, according to several unnamed sources who spoke to The Washington Post. For months, the president and his first lady had expressed frustration at the Democrat’s disappointing numbers, but the night before Thanksgiving proved to be a turning point in which Biden complained to his team that his numbers were unacceptably low. That night, he asked his team what they planned to do about it, according to the outlet. At the time of the meeting, Biden was neck-and-neck in general election polls with GOP front-runner Donald Trump, with Trump predicted to win by a hair with 43 percent of the vote against Biden’s 42 percent, according to a Morning Consult poll. But Biden’s numbers have only continued to plummet since then, likely influenced by the president’s foreign policy: Many Democrats reject his unwavering support of the Israeli invasion of Gaza while others are frustrated by his inability to wrangle Congress to send along more aid to the Ukrainian war front against Russia. At the same time, Biden is particularly irked that voters are not rewarding him for low unemployment figures and a humming economy that has defied predictions of a looming recession. As of December 14, Biden trailed eight points behind the oft-indicted former president, predicted to gain just 35 percent of the vote while Trump curried 43 percent, according to a HarrisX/Harris poll. Top Democrats have warned for months that the Biden campaign had failed to scale up its national campaign quickly enough. Just one year out from Election Day 2024, the campaign has only recently announced leadership teams in battleground states like Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, and South Carolina, according to campaign officials. “The Republican primary could end quickly, and the general election could begin in weeks, not months,” Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist, told the Post. “Given Trump’s noisiness and his ability to bully his way through the daily information wars, I think it’s really important that the Biden campaign move into general election mode as soon as possible. We’re not where we want to be. Some of our coalition is wandering, and we need to go get them back.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams has an interesting opinion on what makes the Big Apple so great: It could be subject to a terrorist attack at any moment. In a Monday interview, Adams was asked to sum up 2023 in one word. “New York,” Adams replied, which is technically two words. “This is a place where everyday you wake up, you could experience everything from a plane crashing into our Trade Center to a person who’s celebrating a new business that’s open. This is a very, very complicated city, and that’s why it’s the greatest city on the globe.” DAN MANNARINO: [Describe the year in one word & tell me why that word.]

MAYOR ADAMS: ""New York. This is a place where everyday you wake up you could experience… a plane crashing into our Trade Center… And that's why it's the greatest city on the globe.""

DM: ""Uh-huh.""

🤷🏻‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/6VNG83j8Bd The utter lack of imagination in Adams’s “one word” answer aside, this is an extremely bad take. A city isn’t great because one of the most traumatic experiences in recent American memory happened there. And you certainly aren’t going to curry favor with your constituents by warning them it could easily happen again. Adams has been in office for about two years, and he recently recorded the lowest-ever approval rating for a New York mayor. A poll released in early December by Quinnipiac University found just 28 percent of respondents said they approved of Adams’s performance. His popularity certainly isn’t helped by his penchant for very strange behavior. In August, Adams chose to mark the anniversary of Indian independence by comparing himself to Gandhi. Adams has also repeatedly said he has carried a photo of a fallen police officer in his wallet for decades. Instead, Adams allegedly instructed his staff in 2022 to print out the photo and then age it with coffee stains. Meanwhile, the mayor is facing a federal investigation into his campaign, as well as an accusation of sexual assault from 30 years ago. Elon Musk may be held accountable for X (formerly Twitter) devolving into a hellscape. The European Commission on Monday opened multiple investigations into the platform under the bloc’s new social media law. The Digital Services Act went into effect in Europe in late August. The sweeping new rulebook aims to create safer online environments: Digital platforms are required to prevent and remove posts that contain illegal goods, services, or content. Targeted ads based on sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs are prohibited, and ads targeting children are heavily restricted. “We now have clear rules, ex-ante obligations, strong oversight, speedy enforcement and deterrent sanctions and we will make full use of our toolbox to protect our citizens and democracies,” EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told Politico. The infringement proceedings into X are the commission’s first ever under the DSA. The four probes will look at whether the platform violated rules on combating illegal content and disinformation, as well as rules on transparency regarding advertising and data sharing. Investigators will also seek to determine if X misled its users when it changed its blue-check system. The check marks used to indicate that a user’s identity had been verified, but they now show that the user is paying a subscription fee in exchange for increased visibility. The investigations do not immediately indicate wrongdoing. But if X is found culpable, the company could face fines of up to 6 percent of its global revenue. The commission has also taken preliminary steps to investigate other major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. Investigators have requested information to see how the platforms combat illegal content and disinformation, and how they protect minors. This isn’t the first time the European Commission has taken aim at X owner Musk. In November, the bloc froze ads on the platform, following a Media Matters report that found X has been placing ads for brands including Apple, Bravo, IBM, Oracle, and Xfinity next to posts that promote Hitler and Nazi beliefs. Hate speech has flourished on X in the little more than a year since Musk bought the platform. The social media research group National Contagion Research Institute found that in the 12 hours after Musk bought X, use of the n-word increased almost 500 percent. And Musk is often a major source of that hate speech and disinformation. In addition to aggressively antisemitic posts, Musk also regularly lets Nazis back on X, shares transphobic content, and spreads conspiracy theories. The American people will never be rid of George Santos—at least not according to him. In a one-on-one interview with comedian Ziwe on Monday, the indicted former Long Island representative said that he would one day return to Congress after outliving the members who voted to expel him, claiming he’ll have plenty of time since he’s only 35 years old. It’s not the first time that Santos has threatened his return to the House’s lower chamber. “I’m not done with public service. I want to go back to Congress,” Santos told radio host Frank Morano on Wednesday, just two weeks after he stormed out of Congress claiming he was done with politics. “I’m not saying today. I’m not saying tomorrow.” “I have a lot of things I need to take care of first,” he said on the program. “I think we all know, but I do have hopes of trying to regain the trust of the American people and going there, because I will continue to expose and root out the rot in our federal government.” Whether or not Santos returns to Congress, it’s unlikely we’ll get him entirely out of our system. The Republican is reportedly making more than $80,000 per day for bespoke videos on the mid-tier celebrity messaging platform Cameo—significantly more than his $174,000 congressional salary during his nine-month term. According to Santos, the only way we’ll stop seeing him is if comedians, producers, and interviewers “stop inviting [him] to your gigs.” “But you can’t because you want the content,” he quipped. i asked george santos if he knew who james baldwin was. watch the FULL interview on YouTube now. link in bio pic.twitter.com/1GsimbKAL7 In another dystopian twist in the interview, Santos rapped Nicki Minaj’s verse from Kanye West’s “Monster” after failing to identify Marsha P. Johnson, James Baldwin, and Harvey Milk. The confrontational comedian also got down to brass tacks with Santos over the baby debacle, in which the politician emerged holding a mysterious baby mid-meltdown while feuding with a Palestinian activist just weeks before his expulsion. Clarence Thomas was in so much debt two decades ago that he tried to get Supreme Court justice salaries raised across the board. Within months, Republican billionaires began giving him extravagant gifts. Thomas spoke at a conservative conference in January 2000, according to a new ProPublica report. In what we now know to be classic Thomas style, he did not report that trip on his financial disclosure forms. On the way home, he sat next to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns. During the flight, Thomas complained bitterly that his salary—then $173,600—was insufficient. He even hinted that multiple justices could resign in the next year if they weren’t given a pay raise. Thomas’s words sparked a rush of attempts on Capitol Hill to significantly raise the justices’ salaries or at least ensure their pay kept pace with inflation. Specifically, Republicans wanted to make sure that Thomas and his fellow staunch conservative Antonin Scalia did not leave the bench. Thomas also petitioned then–Chief Justice William Rehnquist to lift a ban on justices giving paid speeches. Ultimately, the attempts to give justices more money all failed. But soon after, a group of Republican billionaire megadonors began lavishing Thomas and his family with a steady stream of gifts. It is still unclear what exactly prompted the gift-giving, or if it was directly tied to Thomas’s money complaints. But certainly, many of those gifts have alleviated the justice’s financial concerns. One of those generous souls is billionaire Harlan Crow, who has been friends with Thomas for more than two decades. In that time, Crow—a Nazi memorabilia collector—has repeatedly lavished Thomas with expensive gifts. These include island-hopping yacht vacations, private school tuition for Thomas’s nephew, and buying and renovating a Thomas family property, where Thomas’s mother still lives. Crow has also regularly brought Thomas as his guest to the Bohemian Grove, which ProPublica has previously described as a “secretive all-men’s retreat in Northern California” that attracts major corporate and political players. Looking at Thomas’s finances, though, it would seem that keeping pace with inflation wasn’t the main issue. When he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1991, he still had student loans from law school. But during the early 1990s, he made at least two big purchases: a Corvette and a house in Virginia with five acres of land. Thomas and his wife bought the house for $522,000 in 1992. They were able to pay $8,000 out of pocket and had to borrow the rest, according to property records. The couple borrowed huge sums of money throughout the next decade, including a consumer loan of $50,000 and a $100,000 line of credit on their house. In 1998, Thomas became his grandnephew’s legal guardian and began sending him to pricey private schools. The month before Thomas complained about his salary to Stearns, he had borrowed $267,000 from a friend to buy a luxury R.V. That purchase partially paid off, though: In 2001, Thomas took his R.V. to get serviced outside Tampa. While there, he met Earl Dixon, the owner of a Florida pest control company, who ended up giving Thomas $5,000 for his grandnephew’s tuition. “My wife and I are doing fine. We don’t live extravagantly, but we are fine.” A few weeks later, Crow took the Thomases on a yacht vacation. ",https://newrepublic.com/post/177667/bidens-young-voter-problem-just-got-even-worse,
"late Thursday, three voting rights groups had already filed a suit challenging the new law.",Biden slams GOP vote-restriction bills as ‘sick’ and ‘un-American’ while Georgia moves to suppress the vote,"President Joe Biden on Thursday slammed a slew of Republican efforts to suppress the vote as “un-American” as Georgia’s state House and Senate passed a sweeping bill that would vastly limit access to the ballot. The President, in his first formal news conference since taking office, criticized Republican efforts in multiple states to make it more difficult to vote before and on Election Day. The measures were introduced following former President Donald Trump’s lies about a stolen election last November, a strategy Biden described as the “most pernicious thing.” “What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick,” Biden said. The President argued that even Republican voters find measures being adopted in many states, including Texas and Arizona as well as Georgia, unacceptable and “despicable.” “I’m not talking about the election officials – I’m talking about voters. Voters,” Biden said in an impassioned reply to a question about the voting rights issue. The President said that he was trying to figure out how to pass a massive voting rights bill sent to the US Senate by the House. Several Democrats have expressed disquiet about parts of the bill, which Republicans have branded as an unconstitutional power grab by congressional Democrats.     Biden said that he believed current laws being introduced by Republican state legislators to limit voting access and hours were worse than the Jim Crow-era laws that institutionalized racism. Amid questions about whether he will eventually relent in his opposition to abolishing the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes for major legislation and would make passing the voting rights bill impossible, Biden said he had a plan but would not reveal what it was. “I’m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now,” Biden told reporters. After Biden spoke, the Republican-led Georgia Senate approved the version of a sweeping election overhaul bill that the GOP-led House had passed earlier in the day. The legislation then headed to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who signed it Thursday evening, enacting faster-than-expected changes that would restrict voter access in a state that was pivotal in giving Democrats control of the White House and US Senate this year. The legislation would limit ballot drop boxes to inside early voting locations during voting hours, make giving food or drinks to a voter a misdemeanor, allow for unlimited challenges to voter registrations and eligibility, and grant state officials broad rights, including the ability to replace local election officials. It would also shorten the runoff cycle from the current nine weeks to just four weeks and remove the elected secretary of state as chair of the state election board. Texas, Arizona and a clutch of others states are moving to curtail voting access – especially in big cities disproportionately favorable to Democrats. This story has been updated with Georgia’s governor signing the bill and a lawsuit being filed to challenge it. CNN’s Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.

Scott Waldman | 01/18/2024 06:38 AM EST,Biden needs young voters. Can his climate policy rally them?,"Celebrate 25 years of reporting on the ever-evolving world of energy and the environment. Join us 7-DAY UNLIMITED ACCESS  To win a second term, the president must reach what one expert called the “untapped potential” of young Americans who don’t know about his climate policies. President Joe Biden smiles at a group of young supporters last year at the Democratic National Committee winter meeting in Philadelphia. Matt Rourke/AP President Joe Biden has to compete against two foes in November’s election: former President Donald Trump and the living room couch. Young people helped deliver victories for Democrats in the last two election cycles, motivated by issues like climate change, abortion rights and gun control. But Biden risks losing some of those voters — not to Trump, his likely opponent, but to disaffection. Come Nov. 5, many young people might just stay home, pollsters and other experts told E&E News. “I don’t think there’s a risk that any substantial number of them would go over and vote for Donald Trump, but I do think there’s a real risk that they won’t be energized and that they’ll stay home,” said Tom Bonier, a longtime Democratic political strategist and senior adviser to TargetSmart polling firm. Young voters have turned out in record numbers in recent years, becoming key not only to Biden’s 2020 win, but also to Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm elections and 2023 off-year elections. But there are already warning signs that 2024 could be different. A recent poll from Harvard University’s Institute of Politics found that 49 percent of people 29 and younger say they “definitely” plan to vote in the presidential election — down from 57 percent at this point in the 2020 election cycle. One piece of good news for Democrats is that young Republicans and independents account for the largest share of that drop. Still, Biden in particular may need to rally young voters to win a second term. In the 2020 election, young voter turnout was a record 50 percent nationally, a sharp 11-percentage-point increase from 2016, according to Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. That turnout topped 50 percent in many of the key swing states that delivered the election to Biden, including Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada. “When you consider the role that young voters played in Biden’s victory three years ago, it’s going to be really important for him and his coalition to be able to energize young voters and get them out to vote,” Bonier said. People aged 29 and younger who expect to vote in this year’s election rank the economy, gun control and climate change as their top issues, the Tufts survey found. The climate voters are the most motivated. Seventy-two percent of those who ranked climate policy as their top issue said they were likely to vote, according to the survey. That same group was 37 percent more likely to say they would vote Democratic. But there are still many climate-minded voters who would need to be convinced that they should vote for Biden. The Tufts survey found a significant number of young people are worried about climate change and believe political leaders have done nothing to address it, said Sara Suzuki, a senior researcher at Tufts. The vast majority have heard nothing from any campaign. Overall, only about 1 in 5 young people surveyed had heard from any campaign. “There’s really a gap and untapped potential among young people who really have this concern but don’t know what is being done,” she said. Biden has overseen the most aggressive climate policy of any president in modern history. The Inflation Reduction Act — which he signed into law in 2022 — injected billions of dollars into electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines and other clean energy technology. In the last year, EV sales broke records, tens of thousands of U.S. clean energy manufacturing jobs were created and the first offshore wind turbines came online. This year, the administration will roll out major new climate rules and regulations that will limit planet-warming emissions from power plants and vehicles, implement new fees on methane emissions, and impose more stringent requirements on the fossil fuel industry to calculate its greenhouse gas pollution. Under Biden, EPA has also sharply increased its estimate for the societal cost of greenhouse gas emissions, which can help federal agencies justify stricter climate rules. And yet, many Americans are unaware of Biden’s efforts, let alone his landmark climate law. A majority of Americans, or 58 percent, have only heard a “little” about the Inflation Reduction Act, a Yale University survey released last month showed. At the same time, the administration’s fossil fuel policies have angered some of the young progressives that Biden will need in November. That’s because Biden has also overseen record levels of oil and gas production. The U.S. is now producing a daily average of about 13.2 million barrels of crude oil, up from a peak of 13 million under Trump and more than the next two top-producing countries, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Some fossil fuel projects advanced by the administration, especially Alaska’s Willow project and Mountain Valley pipeline in West Virginia, are also targets of viral TikTok videos, alienating at least some segments of young voters. Despite those challenges, the Biden campaign is preparing to use climate policy as one of the sharpest contrasts with Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris will be a key part of that outreach, White House officials say. Biden and Harris will spend the year “laying out the dire stakes of this election so they can secure reelection and continue to advance the essential work of creating clean energy jobs and leading the world toward a more sustainable future,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Seth Schuster. Harris will continue last year’s strategy of talking about climate policy with college audiences and social media influencers, while also attending groundbreakings for clean energy projects around the country. She is also expected to focus her speeches on climate — even during unrelated events. During a visit last week to the African Methodist Episcopal Church in South Carolina, for example, Harris talked about the importance of improving air quality for local front-line communities. “I think you’ll see on the youth engagement part a continued effort for the vice president to go to where young people are, use platforms young people use and speak in a way that is resonant to young folks,” said Ike Irby, special assistant to the president and deputy domestic policy adviser to the vice president. The White House and its allies are now running a nationwide education campaign on Biden’s climate policies and the work that still needs to be done in a second term. That includes an $80 million effort from Climate Power, a communications organization that is partnering with super political action committee Future Forward to rally voters in the key swing states expected to decide the election. Voters of Tomorrow, an organization focused on mobilizing and engaging Gen Z voters, is also joining the effort, conducting outreach on college campuses and reaching out to people who will be voting in their first presidential election. Many young people want Biden to do more on climate, but also recognize that they “have a seat at the table” with him, whereas Trump has ignored their concerns, said Jack Lobel, the group’s spokesperson and a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia University. There is still time to highlight the massive difference between the two candidates, he said, and shrink the pool of young voters who don’t know what Biden has already accomplished on climate policy. “When we see this disconnect between Joe Biden and his policies, that presents opportunities for us,” he said. “It’s not a bad sign, it’s just a sign we have a lot of work to do.” Request a FREE trial to receive unlimited access to  The transformation of the energy sector.

,They voted for Trump and then for Biden. Here's what these swing voters think now,"Don Gonyea President Biden campaigns for California Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month.  Many moderate Republicans switched allegiances in last year's election and backed Joe Biden because they could not abide four more years of Donald Trump. These voters, who swung from backing Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020, helped make the difference for Biden in places where the margins were close — often, the suburbs. So today, about eight months into Biden's presidency, how do these voters view him? In a pair of virtual focus groups NPR observed last week, featuring more than a dozen such voters from key states, a picture emerged of disappointment with Biden — but no regrets that they helped send Trump packing after one term. Let's start with the disappointment. Polls show Biden's public approval ratings have taken a hit in recent months. The voters in these focus groups reflected that slide. They were worried about the spread of the delta variant and how COVID-19 continues to hurt the economy. They were wary of Democrats' big spending plans on infrastructure and other programs, alarmed by the troubles they see along the Texas border, and were very disturbed by the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. ""What happened in Afghanistan, to me, was the worst thing that's happened since Saigon."" That reference to the 1975 U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam came from Paul, who lives in central Pennsylvania. (We agreed to identify focus group participants by first name only.) He didn't buy Biden's explanation that Trump set the exit in motion by committing to a withdrawal of troops in a deal with the Taliban last year. ""He didn't have to stick to the timeframe Trump set up,"" Paul asserted, ""but he kept sticking to it and sticking to it, and a lot of people died and a lot of people were left behind. So I think that was squarely on him."" Still, perhaps unlike the pandemic and the economy, Afghanistan may fade from the news over time and, as such, may not affect long-term impressions of Biden as much. And on the coronavirus, the focus group participants — all vaccinated — mostly gave Biden solid marks. It's clear he benefits from comparisons to his predecessor on that. ""He's definitely been better than Trump on handling COVID,"" said Xaveria from the Atlanta area. But she also said the fact that the delta variant is creating such problems means you still can't feel really great about how the current administration is doing regarding the pandemic. Then she added that there's just an overall unease that's troubling. ""It's just kind of, like, not really trusting what to expect,"" she said. As for Biden, she said, ""I just put him at, like, the average. He hasn't done anything great. And outside of Afghanistan, nothing awful."" But she was clearly hoping for better. These two focus groups consisted of all Biden voters, but overwhelmingly they still consider themselves Republicans. They haven't yet left the party, even though they're disillusioned by Trump's ongoing presence and the control he still holds. In contrast to the majority of Republicans responding to polls, none of these voters falsely believes the 2020 election was stolen. None said they regret their 2020 vote. And while they may be disappointed in Biden, they absolutely rule out voting for Trump if he runs for president again. Former President Donald Trump waves to the crowd at the end of a rally on Saturday in Perry, Ga.  Take Christine from the Philadelphia suburbs. Like others in her focus group, she said she first voted for Trump because he was a businessman and not a politician. But she got far more than she bargained for. She used blunt language to describe the former president: ""I felt like we had this monster in office that was bipolar, up and down, irrational, crazy thinking."" She called Trump ""childish,"" said that ""crazy things came out of his mouth,"" and that he was ""not good for the United States."" And after all of that, Christine confessed: ""I didn't want to vote for Biden. And I'm going to be honest with you, I would have voted for anybody but Trump."" Others in the group blamed Trump for inciting racial tensions, citing how he described participants in a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., as ""very fine people."" As for Trump's oft-stated claim that he would ""drain the swamp"" in Washington, D.C., focus group member Mike, who lives in Georgia, had this retort: ""I think he made the swamp bigger."" These swing voters readily say that their frustrations with both a Republican Party in Trump's grasp and with Biden leave them feeling a bit lost politically. Georgia resident Xaveria asked a simple question: ""It's like, where do we go?"" These voter discussions were part of a series of focus groups that have been organized by longtime political strategist Sarah Longwell, the publisher of The Bulwark website who herself is a Republican who's worked to defeat Trump. She hears voters like Xaveria and Christine and says they reject Trump and GOP candidates trying to be ""Trumpy"" themselves. She says such voters are open to voting for Democrats, but the party also needs to nominate more moderate candidates to make these voters feel welcome there. These moderate-to-conservative voters ""are very clear that they feel politically unmoored, politically homeless,"" Longwell said in an interview. ""I really view these voters as up for grabs in 2022 and 2024,"" she said. But Longwell says it matters who the candidates are and how the parties see themselves. And Longwell says it makes such voters worth watching. It also makes them potentially pivotal. ""Right now, people who are willing to change their vote from one party to another really hold the keys to political power,"" she said.

,Remarks by President Biden on Standing up for Democracy," Columbus Club, Union Station
Washington, D.C. (November 2, 2022) 7:01 P.M. EDT 
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, everyone.  Just a few days ago, a little before 2:30 a.m. in the morning, a man smashed the back windows and broke into the home of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the third-highest ranking official in America.
 
He carried in his backpack zip ties, duct tape, rope, and a hammer.  As he told the police, he had come looking for Nancy Pelosi to take her hostage, to interrogate her, to threaten to break her kneecaps.  But she wasn’t there.
 
Her husband, my friend Paul Pelosi, was home alone.
 
The assailant tried to take Paul hostage.  He woke him up, and he wanted to tie him up.  The assailant ended up using a hammer to smash Paul’s skull.
 
Thankfully, by the grace of God, Paul survived.
 
All of this happened after the assault, and it just — it’s hard to even say; it’s hard to even say — after the assailant entered the home asking, “Where’s Nancy?  Where’s Nancy?”
 
Those were the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States Capitol on January the 6th when they broke windows, kicked in the doors, brutally attacked law enforcement, roamed the corridors hunting for officials, and erected gallows to hang the former Vice President, Mike Pence.
 
It was an enraged mob that had been whipped up into a frenzy by a President repeating over and over again the Big Lie that the election of 2020 had been stolen.
 
It’s a lie that fueled the dangerous rise in political violence and voter intimidation over the past two years.
 
Even before January the 6th, we saw election officials and election workers in a number of states subject to menacing calls, physical threats, even threats to their very lives.
 
In Georgia, for example, the Republican secretary of state and his family were subjected to death threats because he refused to break the law and give in to the defeated President’s demand: just find him 11,780 votes.  “Just find me 11,780 votes.”
 
Election workers, like Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, were harassed and threatened just because they had the courage to do their job and stand up for truth, to stand up for our democracy.
 
This institution — this intimidation and this violence against Democrats and Republicans and nonpartisan officials just doing their jobs are the consequence of lies told for power and profit, lies of conspiracy and malice, lies repeated over and over that generate a cycle of anger, hate, vitriol, and even violence.
 
In this moment, we have to confront those lies with the truth.  The very future of our nation depends on it.
 
My fellow Americans, we’re facing a defining moment, an inflection point.  And we must — with one overwhelming, unified voice — speak as a country and say there is no place — no place — for voter intimidation or political violence in America, whether it’s directed at Democrats or Republicans.  No place, period.  No place ever.
 
I speak today near Capitol Hill, near the U.S. Capitol — the citadel of our democracy.
 
I know there is a lot at stake in these midterm elections, from our economy, to the safety of our streets, to our personal freedoms, to the future of healthcare and Social Security and Medicare.  It’s all important.
 
But we’ll have our differences.  We’ll have our difference of opinion.  And that’s how it’s supposed to be.  But there is something else at stake: democracy itself. 
 
I’m not the only one who sees it.  Recent polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of Americans believe our democracy at — is at risk, that our democracy is under threat.  They too see that democracy is on the ballot this year, and they’re deeply concerned about it.
 
So, today, I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance.
 
We must vote, knowing what’s at stake is not just the policy of the moment, but institutions that have held us together as we have sought a more perfect union are also at stake.  We must vote knowing who we have been, what we’re at risk of becoming.
 
Look, my fellow Americans, the old expression, “Freedom is not free; it requires constant vigilance.”
 
From the very beginning, nothing has been guaranteed about democracy in America.  Every generation has had to defend it, protect it, preserve it, choose it, for that’s what democracy is: It’s a choice — a decision of the people, by the people, and for the people.
 
The issue couldn’t be clearer, in my view.  We, the people, must decide whether we will have fair and free elections and every vote counts. 
 
We, the people, must decide whether we’re going to sustain a republic where reality is accepted, the law is obeyed, and your vote is truly sacred. 
 
We, the people, must decide whether the rule of law will prevail or whether we’ll allow the dark forces to thirst — that thirst for power put ahead of the principles that we — have long guided us.
 
You know, American democracy is under attack because the defeated former President of the United States refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election.  He refuses to accept the will of the people.  He refuses to accept the fact that he lost.
 
He has abused his power and put the loyalty to himself before loyalty to the Constitution.  And he’s made a Big Lie an article of faith in the MAGA Republican Party — the minority of that party.
 
The great irony about the 2020 election is it’s the most attacked election in our history.  And yet — and yet, there is no election in our history that we can be more certain of its results.
 
Every legal challenge that could have been brought was brought.  Every recount that could have been undertaken was undertaken.  Every recount confirmed the results.
 
Wherever fact or evidence have been demanded, the Big Lie has been proven to be just that, a big lie, every single time.
 
Yet, now, extreme MAGA Republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections but elections being held now and into the future.
 
The extreme MAGA element of the Republican Party — which is a minority of that party, as I said earlier, but is its driving force — is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020 to suppress the rights of voters and subvert the electoral system itself.
 
That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts.  Instead of waiting until an election is over, they’re starting well before it.  They are starting now.
 
They’ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. 
 
It’s estimated that there are more than 300 election deniers on the ballot all across America this year.
 
We can’t ignore the impact this is having on our country.  It’s damaging, it’s corrosive, and it’s destructive.
 
And I want to be very clear: This is not about me.  It’s about all of us.  It’s about what makes America “America.”  It’s about the durability of our democracy.
 
For democracies are more than a form of government.  They’re a way of being, a way of seeing the world — a way that defines who we are, what we believe, why we do what we do.
 
Democracy is simply that fundamental. 
 
We must, in this moment, dig deep within ourselves and recognize that we can’t take democracy for granted any longer.
 
With democracy on the ballot, we have to remember these first principles.  Democracy means the rule of the people — not the rule of monarchs or the monied, but the rule of the people.
 
Autocracy is the opposite of democracy.  It means the rule of one: one person, one interest, one ideology, one party.
 
To state the obvious, the lives of billions of people, from antiquity until now, have been shaped by the battle between these competing forces: between the aspirations of the many and the greed and power of the few, between the people’s right for self-determination and the self-seeking autocrat, between the dreams of a democracy and the appetites of an autocracy.
 
What we’re doing now is going to determine whether democracy will long endure.  It, in my view, is the biggest of questions: whether the American system that prizes the individual, bends toward justice, and depends — depends on the rule of law — whether that system will prevail.
 
This is the struggle we’re now in: a struggle for democracy, a struggle for decency and dignity, a struggle for prosperity and progress, a struggle for the very soul of America itself.
 
Make no mistake — democracy is on the ballot for us all. 
 
We must remember that democracy is a covenant.  We need to start looking out for each other again, seeing ourselves as “We the People,” not as entrenched enemies.
 
This is a choice we can make.  Disunion and chaos are not inevitable. 
 
There’s been anger before in America.  There’s been division before in America.  But we have never given up on the American experiment, and we can’t do that now.
 
The remarkable thing about American democracy is this: Just enough of us, on just enough occasions, have chosen not to dismantle democracy but to preserve democracy.  We must choose that path again.
 
Because democracy is on the ballot, we have to remember that even in our darkest moments there are fundamental values and beliefs that unite us as Americans, and they must unite us now.
 
What are they? 
 
Well, I think, first, we believe the vote in America is sacred — to be honored, not denied; respected, not dismissed; counted, not ignored.  A vote is not a partisan tool to be counted when it helps your candidates and tossed aside when it doesn’t.
 
Second, we must, with an overwhelming voice, stand against political violence and voter intimidation.  Period.  Stand up and speak against it. 
 
We don’t settle our differences in America with a riot, a mob, or a bullet, or a hammer.  We settle them peacefully at the battol [sic] — at the battol boc- — the ballot box.
 
We have to be honest with ourselves though.  We have to face this problem.  We cannot turn away from it.  We can’t pretend it’s just going to solve itself. 
 
There is an alarming rise in the number of our people in this country condoning political violence or simply remaining silent because silence is complicity.  The disturbing rise in voter intimidation.  The pernicious tendency to excuse political violence or at least — at least trying to explain it away.
 
We can’t allow this sentiment to grow.  We must confront it head on now.  It has to stop now. 
 
I believe the voices excusing or calling for violence and intimidation are a distinct minority in America, but they’re loud and they are determined.
 
We have to be more determined.  All of us who reject political violence and voter intimidation — and I believe that’s the overwhelming majority of the American people — all of us must unite to make it absolutely clear that violence and intimidation have no place in America.
 
And third, we believe in democracy.  That’s who we are as Americans.  I know it isn’t easy.  Democracy is imperfect.  It always has been.  But we are all called to defend it now.  Now.
 
History and common sense tell us that liberty, opportunity, and justice thrive in a democracy, not in an autocracy.
 
At our best, America is not a zero-sum society where for you to succeed, someone else has to fail.  The promise of America is big enough — it’s big enough for everyone to succeed.  Every generation opening the door of opportunity just a little wider.  Every generation, including those who had been excluded before.
 
We believe we should leave no one behind, because each one of us is a child of God, and every person — every person is sacred.  If that’s true, then every person’s rights must be sacred as well.
 
Individual dignity, individual worth, individual determination — that’s America.  That’s democracy.  And that’s what we have to defend.
 
Look, even as I speak here tonight, 27 million people have already cast their ballot in the midterm elections.  Millions more will cast their ballots in the final days leading up to November the 9th — 8th, excuse me.   And for the first time — this is the first time since the national election of 2020, once again we’re seeing record turnout all over the country. 
 
And that’s good.  We want Americans to vote.  We want every American’s voice to be heard. 
 
Now we have to move the process forward.  We know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting or by mail in America.  And we know that many states don’t start counting those ballots until after the polls close on November 8th. 
 
That means, in some cases, we won’t know the winner of the election for a few days — until after a few days after the election.  It takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner. 
 
It’s always been important for citizens in a democracy to be informed and engaged.  Now it’s important for citizens to be patient as well.  That’s how this is supposed to work.  
 
This is also the first national election since the events of January 6th, when the armed, angry mob stormed the U.S.  Capitol.  I wish — I wish I could say the assault on our democracy had ended that day, but I cannot. 
 
As I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America — for governor, Congress, attorney general, secretary of state — who won’t commit — they will not commit to accepting the results of elections that they’re running in. 
 
That is a path to chaos in America.  It’s unprecedented, it’s unlawful, and it’s un-American.  As I’ve said before, you can’t love your country only when you win. 
 
This is no ordinary year.  So I ask you to think long and hard about the moment we’re in.  In a typical year, we’re often not faced with questions of whether the vote we cast will preserve democracy or put us at risk.  But this year, we are.
 
This year, I hope you will make the future of our democracy an important part of your decision to vote and how you vote. 
 
I hope you’ll ask a simple question of each candidate you might vote for: Will that person accept the legitimate will of the American people and the people voting in his district or her district?  Will that person accept the outcome of the election, win or lose?
 
The answer to that question is vital.  And in my opinion, it should be decisive.  On the answer to that question hangs the future of the country we love so much and the fate of the democracy that has made so much possible for us. 
 
Too many people have sacrificed too much for too many years for us to walk away from the American project and democracy.  Because we’ve enjoyed our freedoms for so long, it’s easy to think they’ll always be with us no matter what. 
 
But that isn’t true today.  In our bones, we know democracy at risk — is at risk.  But we also know this: It’s within our power, each and every one of us, to preserve our democracy. 
 
And I believe we will.  I think I know this country.  I know we will. 
 
You have the power.  It’s your choice.  It’s your decision.  The fate of the nation, the fate of the soul of America lies where it always does: with the people — in your hands, in your heart, and your ballot. 
 
My fellow Americans, we’ll meet this moment.  We just need to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America.  There’s nothing — nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. 
 
May God bless you all.  May God protect our troops.  May God bless those standing guard over our democracy.
 
Thank you, and Godspeed.  (Applause.)

"Illia Novikov, Barry Hatton, Associated Press",Biden isn’t on the ballot in New Hampshire’s primary. Here’s why,"Matt Loffman Leave your feedback Twenty-one Democratic candidates will appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot Tuesday, but incumbent President Joe Biden isn’t one of them. He’s the first president running for reelection to skip the Granite State primary in more than 50 years. Why? It’s all about a change to the Democratic National Committee’s rules that made South Carolina — not New Hampshire — the first official primary of the Democratic presidential nominating cycle. Because the New Hampshire primary is “non-compliant” with new DNC rules, the national party deemed the contest “meaningless.” The winner next Tuesday will be in name only, walking away with no delegates to the convention in August. New Hampshire leaders – both Republicans and Democrats – were not pleased, banding together to uphold state law that requires its voters to have the first primary New Hampshire Attorney General Brendan O’Donnell filed his own cease-and-desist letter accusing the DNC of engaging in voter suppression. “This is the election,” said New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, who oversees the state’s election process. “There is no other election taking place in New Hampshire where delegates are going to be awarded to the convention. So whether the Democratic National Committee decides to recognize those delegates or not, that’s on them.” Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.  The DNC instructed candidates to “take all steps possible not to participate” in the New Hampshire primary as currently scheduled. Two high-profile Democratic challengers ignored the DNC: Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson, an author making her second run for the nomination. Biden chose to skip the state altogether. “It’s really unfortunate and sad that the president of the United States chose not to be on the New Hampshire ballot,” Scanlan told the NewsHour. “The decision not to do that comes across as petty, but New Hampshire is moving forward with or without him.” Enter the “write-in Biden” effort. It’s a grassroots and mostly volunteer campaign led by the president’s supporters in New Hampshire, and it’s running on a shoestring budget. Organizers hope to recruit thousands of volunteers to stand outside every voting location in the state to tell people how to write-in the president’s name on the ballot. Since the effort launched last fall, a super PAC has also joined the effort, spending about $1.25 million so far on direct mailings and advertising. A sample New Hampshire ballot showing all 21 Democratic candidates. Not listed? President Joe Biden. Image courtesy of New Hampshire Secretary of State While high-profile Democrats in and out of the state are vocally supportive of the write-in effort, it is unaffiliated with Biden’s official reelection campaign. The goal is simply to get Joe Biden a victory, and organizers are lowering expectations for what a victory looks like. One Democrat connected to the super PAC told the NewsHour a win is getting just one more vote than the candidate in second place. Write-in campaigns can be a logistical nightmare that require a lot of voter education. The president’s supporters have to explain to voters to look all the way at the bottom of the ballot — skipping the long list of Democratic candidates — to fill in a bubble and write the president’s name. Organizers say one thing is to their advantage: “Joe Biden” is an easy name to spell. They take comfort in the successful 2010 write-in campaign of Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski in Alaska, which required significant ad spending to teach voters how to spell her name. Plus, New Hampshire’s secretary of state is expected to allow misspellings to count if the voter’s intent is clear. Recent polling suggests that despite the challenges of a write-in campaign, Biden has a comfortable lead over the 21 candidates whose names are actually on the ballot. More than three-quarters of Democratic voters have decided who they will vote for, and 69 percent plan on writing in Biden’s name, according to a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll. That’s far ahead of Phillips and Williamson, who have 7 and 6 percent respectively. (In March 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last incumbent to run as a write-in candidate in New Hampshire, won a narrow 7-point victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy before dropping out of the race later that month.) Phillips entered the campaign in late October and has been trying to grow his name recognition in the months since, recently running his first ads in New Hampshire. While his advisers at one time suggested he could win more than 40 percent of the vote, Phillips recently told Politico that finishing around 20 percent “would be magnificent.” He also suggested that getting anything less than 60 percent of the vote should be troubling to the incumbent. The eventual winner of the Democratic primary will have a lot to do with voter turnout on Tuesday. With an incumbent running without major competition, the secretary of state would usually expect lower turnout in the Democratic race, but the write-in campaign is complicating his turnout projections. Scanlan estimated Friday that voter turnout would be about 410,000 voters, just less than half of registered voters in the state. Expected turnout for Republicans was close to four times that of Democrats, according to his projections. Nearly 40 percent of the state’s voters are unaffiliated with a political party and can vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary. That includes around 4,000 Democrats who switched their voter registration to undeclared ahead of the October deadline. Many intend to vote in the Republican primary. “The energy and the enthusiasm and the interest is clearly on the Republican side because of the number of candidates who are engaged in that race,” Scanlan said. Thalia Floras, a lifelong New Hampshire resident, changed her party registration for the first time ever ahead of this election, from Democrat to undeclared. She has grown weary about Biden’s age and thinks he should not have run for a second term. But because her vote in the Democratic primary for either Williamson or Phillips (“both great candidates,” she said) would not count toward their delegate totals, she’s planning to vote for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the Republican primary instead. “I want to boost the candidate that not only could have a chance to beat Donald Trump but that I can respect as my president,” she said. Floras and her friend Hella Ross went to dozens of town hall meetings to hear from the candidates directly and learn about their positions. Ross, another lifelong Democrat, was also hoping to vote in the Democratic primary and said she would support either Phillips or Williamson as the nominee. “This particular election is calling for desperate measures,” she said. Like her friend, she plans to vote for Haley, who she believes is “best positioned right now to defeat Trump.” The prospect of Democrats staying home or undeclared voters choosing a Republican ballot is just one of the complicated calculations ahead of election day next week. A Democratic primary with potentially a large number of write-in votes will complicate counting, too. Many smaller towns in the state hand count all of their ballots. Larger cities will have machines that separate out the write-in ballots that will then be counted by hand. Local election officials have been recruiting extra volunteers to help with the counting, which will continue on primary night until every vote is counted. That won’t be unusually late, the secretary of state said. Despite the hand count, there is just one race on the ballot, which Scanlan said will simplify the process. He expects most of the results to be reported by 10 p.m. local time, just two hours after the last polls close.

"contrast, voters ages 18-29 overwhelmingly picked Biden over Donald Trump in 2020, according to exit polls at the time: 60%-36%.",Will Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war turn off young and Muslim voters in 2024?,"""The real question ... is whether this is actually going to linger for a year."" President Joe Biden is struggling with younger voters and Muslim Americans who don't approve of the way he's handled the Israel-Hamas war, recent polling by NBC News and Quinnipiac University shows. And while some advocates suggest that could be a key factor in next year's election, some foreign policy and elections experts cautioned that it may not be so simple, still a year away from voting. ""The politics of this with younger Democrats are complicated right now,"" said Brian Goldsmith, with the consulting firm Kona Media. ""This is clearly a dividing line, especially for Democrats under 35."" While the president's solidarity with Israel is shared in these polls by a majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, the polls also showed younger voters are more likely to sympathize with Palestinians. Some younger voters who spoke with ABC News have warned they could defect to a third party or stay home next year. Even with the news of a temporary humanitarian pause and prisoner exchange deal in which Hamas has released some hostages from Gaza, these voters are saying Biden is not doing enough in light of Israel's relentless bombardment of the territory in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack. ""That's a long, long ways from what Biden could do for Gaza if he wanted to and far from what I would personally need to see to regain confidence in Biden as a candidate,"" said 30-year-old Gabriela M., who voted for Biden in 2020. Gabriela, who asked not to be quoted by her full name because she worried about potential professional repercussions discussing a divisive issue, said that if it comes down to a Biden-versus-Trump repeat in 2024, she won't be voting for either one. ""In my local elections, I'll get in my ballot,"" she told ABC News. ""But I don't want [Biden] to take my vote for granted and just assume that because he's the lesser of two evils that I'll just vote for him."" According to a Quinnipiac University national poll released in mid-November, 54% of registered voters said their sympathies lie more with the Israelis, while 24% say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians. But among younger voters, ages 18-34, 52% said their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians while 29% said the Israelis. A poll published last week by NBC News painted a more dire picture for Biden on the issue. The survey found that just 34% of registered voters approved of how he is handling the Israel-Hamas war, while 56% disapproved -- and among Democrats, only half, 51%, approved. A staggering 70% of voters ages 18-34 disapproved of Biden's handling. Broadly speaking, Democrats have become more sympathetic to the Palestinians compared with the Israelis in the last two decades, Gallup polling has found. In January, months before the Hamas attack, Democrats for the first time said their sympathies were more with the Palestinians -- a change that Middle East experts previously suggested to ABC News is driven in part by partisanship, as Israeli politics have become increasingly conservative, and the influence of domestic social movements like Black Lives Matter. Frustrations with the administration has sparked some public outcry this month, including a tense protest on Nov. 15 in front of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., while lawmakers were in the building, that led to police clashing with demonstrators. Another protest forced state party officials to cancel events at the California Democratic Convention in Sacramento on Nov. 18. Gabriela said the Israel-Hamas war is only one reason she won't be voting for the president again. ""It feels like he could have done more for student loan relief, immigration and to enshrine abortion rights in federal law or queer rights,"" she said. (Biden's push to cancel tens of millions of people's federal student loan debt was blocked by the Supreme Court, which said it was unconstitutional; his proposal to codify abortion access has not gained traction in Congress.) Earlier this month, several progressive groups, including March for Our Lives, Gen-Z for Change and the Sunrise Movement, wrote an open letter to Biden warning his handling of the war could depress turnout among millennial and Generation Z voters in 2024. ""It's still just hard for young people to justify to themselves, morally, voting for someone after seeing these images, after seeing what's been going on in the Middle East,"" 22-year-old Anish Mohanty, the communications director of Gen-Z for Change, told ABC News. Mohanty said that Biden's stance on issues like climate change is ""appreciated by our generation,"" but ""are we supposed to tell other young people, especially if they are from marginalized communities, to vote for somebody who's contributed to what's going on in the Middle East?"" The Biden administration has repeatedly said it believes Israel has the right to defend itself and seek to destroy Hamas in the wake of Oct. 7 attack, and the White House has proposed billions more in military funding for the Israelis. Hamas, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization, is also deeply embedded in civilian life in Gaza -- and the White House has tried to stress that Israel has an obligation to try and limit civilian casualties amid the large death toll. Biden has also pushed for aid to get into Gaza during Israel's retaliatory operations. More than 14,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and tens of thousands more have been injured. More than 1,200 people have been killed in Israel, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. ""Much more needs to be done to protect civilians and to make sure that humanitarian assistance reaches them,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in early November. ""Far too many Palestinians have been killed, far too many have suffered these past weeks, and we want to do everything possible to prevent harm to them and to maximize the assistance that gets to them."" Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that ""we don't live in an era where an administration can control the messaging."" ""The pictures control the messaging, and they're not photoshopped,"" he said. ""I think the administration knows that."" Miller said he sees signs of increasing concern within the Democratic Party and the Biden administration that the Israelis are pursuing ""far too aggressive a strategy and the administration is far too acquiescent,"" he said. ""You've got a very strong pro-Israeli frame, which in various constituencies in Washington has resulted in a lot of unhappiness,"" Miller said. ""In 25 years, working under half a dozen secretaries of state, I've never seen the degree of dissent or opposition to a policy vocalized so prominently in Congress, among White House staff ... [the] Department of State"" and beyond. Israeli officials have insisted that its military is taking steps to curb civilian casualties, which is complicated because Hamas fighters don't abide by international law in separating themselves from non-combatants. However, Biden's allies and outside analysts said that drawing 2024 predictions from the current problems isn't so obvious. A rematch against Trump could have its own galvanizing effect on Democratic voters, given how deeply unpopular Trump is among them, some experts said. ""I don't think young voters were super excited about Joe Biden four years ago,"" said Goldsmith, the political consultant, who supports Biden. ""But ultimately they came out in record numbers because"" of Trump. Younger voters also don't vote as often as older demographics, who have been more approving of Biden's handling of Israel and Hamas, a trend which risks undercutting the argument that younger voters' views could be decisive next year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only 54% of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 29 voted in the 2020 election. That's compared to 67% of the population overall. Census data shows that because America is an aging country, there are also simply more older voters than younger ones. Combined with lower turnout, that weakens their influence. ""Young voters might be dissatisfied with Biden and so they won't turn out to vote for him -- well, like half of them probably weren't going to do that anyway,"" said Nathaniel Rakich, a senior elections analyst at 538. ""I think at the end of the day, most of them will realize that if they want to stop Trump, Biden is their best choice,"" Rakich added. Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz maintained that the president is not taking younger voters for granted. ""Next year's election is deeply consequential for young people, and we are working hard to highlight how an extreme MAGA agenda would devastate the financial security, safety, and freedom of young people, and how President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting for the future that America's young people deserve,"" Munoz said in a statement to ABC News. Some Muslim and Arab Americans who supported Biden in 2020 and who live in swing states like Michigan are also warning in interviews with ABC News they could sit out next year. There's less reliable polling on the extent of their feelings, but activists are speaking out. Hassan Abdel Salam is an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota who says he has grown frustrated with how the Biden administration is handling the Israel-Hamas war. He's part of group calling themselves ""Abandon Biden."" Not only do they say they won't vote for the president -- they've also promised to actively campaign against him. Salam told ABC News the group is ""committed"" to voting in the 2024 presidential election but who they will vote for in Biden's stead remains up in the air. ""It may have to be an independent candidate. We don't know who that is ... right now we're really focused on just making sure that our signal to the White House is clear,"" he said. Michigan, which has one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States, has some 206,000 registered Muslim voters, a 22% jump from 2016, according to Emgage, a Muslim American political advocacy group. Biden won the state in 2020 by only about 155,000 votes. ""Biden would be persona non grata if he entered Dearborn right now,"" Amer Zahr, a Palestinian American comedian and progressive Democratic activist, previously told ABC News, referring to a city in Michigan where half of the 110,000 residents are of Middle Eastern or North African Descent. Still, the election is many months away, polling experts and strategists said. Biden's dire approval ratings are an issue for him, but not necessarily predictive, they said. ""Probably, dissatisfaction with him among certain core Democratic groups like young voters is contributing to a bit of a polling slump these days for Biden. The real question, though, is whether this is actually going to linger for a year -- and that's the totally unknowable thing,"" said Rakich with 538. ""I don't think anybody can say with any kind of authority or precision that that's what's happening now,"" said Miller, a former deputy special Middle East coordinator at the State Department. ""If this were happening next November, that might make for a plausible case.""

,Saving democracy is central to Biden's campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center's executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that U.S. President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former president Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn't so sure. It's the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away."" Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Penn., with its deep symbolism for the country's struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation's founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country's democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden's messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his five-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward."" He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump."" Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That's not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president's pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country's largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden's messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden's campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center's board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump's rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. ""It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county's working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,The Moral and Strategic Calculus of Voting for Joe Biden to Defeat Trump — or Not,"ALL RIGHTS RESERVED DONALD TRUMP ran for president in 2016 on an often ad-libbed and reactionary campaign of hate, greed, xenophobia, misogyny, and racism. He clearly viewed the fact that a black man had ascended to the presidency as an abomination and rightly assessed that there were a lot of racists in this country who saw the eight years the Obamas spent living in the White House as a crime against the real, white America. Trump already had a brand, realized early on the power of being an outsider in U.S. presidential elections, and focused on some key economic issues, including trade, that would play well with people dissatisfied with the two party system’s regular offerings. And he focused on hate. To directly call Trump fascistic is not incorrect, but it also may give him too much credit. He has largely been an incompetent authoritarian, albeit one whose key policies have caused massive suffering and death. What we have seen throughout his career and his three and a half years in power is that Trump is primarily concerned with making money for himself, his family, and his cronies. Literally everything this man does is a racket. His foreign policy has been hawkish and reckless, but aside from his often insane rhetoric and public threats to annihilate various countries, it has not represented a radical departure from that of his predecessors. He acts like an unstable buffoon on the international stage, and he burns bridges with traditional U.S. allies, governments, and international bodies across the globe. Trump openly embraces vile authoritarians and mocks democratic leaders and institutions. All of this is certainly dangerous and unsettling, though some of it is disproportionately offensive to establishment foreign policy elites. Trump’s predecessor started his own share of wars, did some regime change, ratcheted up an existing war, downsized another, and greatly expanded the use of weaponized drones and so-called targeted killings. But Barack Obama delivered these policies with an intelligently crafted, though at times absurd, justification wrapped in the notion of inventing a “smarter” way to wage war. Liberals ate it up. Obama’s policies killed a lot of innocent people. The few times Trump has signaled his openness to pursue a less militaristic approach to long-existing crises, such as the war in Afghanistan or the conflict with North Korea, he has been ridiculed by leading Democrats and liberal pundits. In terms of Trump’s military pursuits, he has proven less murderous than George W. Bush and more of a war criminal than Jimmy Carter. So far. That can certainly change with a second term. Perhaps the gravest threat posed by the unstable narcissist in the White House is that of the use of a first strike nuclear weapon. It has never been beyond the pale to imagine an apocalyptic nuclear scenario that begins with a tweet from a foreign leader Trump hates. The fact that we can even imagine this is nothing to wag a stick at. Trump’s monumentally incompetent handling of the coronavirus pandemic hammers home some of the greatest dangers posed by his presidency. It has highlighted the extent to which he is motivated not by any sense of duty or concern for his fellow citizens, but by money and his popularity among a fairly small circle of corporations, television hosts, and special interests. That Trump uses the daily platform of what are supposed to be public health briefings by professionals to pontificate ignorantly, babble incoherently, or to score points politically underscores how little he actually cares about the U.S. public and our lives. Instead, he is obsessed with the stock market as an imagined extension of his own ego. It is the sign of a deeply sick individual that he would effectively make aid conditional on how nice governors are to him. Trump encourages group protests against Democratic governors during a pandemic with scores of people refusing to wear protective gear, while his administration has insisted on testing visitors for coronavirus before meeting with the president or vice president. All of this costs lives, as sure as any military operation. Demonstrators gather in front of the Colorado State Capitol building to protest coronavirus stay-at-home orders during a “ReOpen Colorado” rally in Denver, Colorado, on April 19, 2020. PERHAPS THE MOST devastating dimension of Trump’s time in office, on a policy level, is how the Republican establishment brilliantly exploited Trump as a Trojan horse for its extreme agenda. It is unlikely that any of the GOP’s preferred candidates could have beaten Hillary Clinton in 2016. Trump dragged the Republican Party kicking and screaming back into executive power. For them, he was a messiah they chided and scorned when he first appeared, but now they prostrate themselves before him every minute of every day. The public still does not know the full story of how Mike Pence ended up on the ticket as Trump’s running mate, but when it was announced, it was clear that the professional Republicans and the extremist evangelical lobby had their inside man. With Mitch McConnell running the Senate and Pence babysitting the president, Trump could focus on barking for the crowds in between golf outings and Twitter rants while the political hitmen in Washington dust off every extreme right-wing initiative they’ve cooked up for decades and which they work day and night to methodically ram through. Trump has had his signature moments, but much of his policy has been outsourced to craftier and more sophisticated policymakers. Trump is famously not a fan of reading detailed briefings, but give him a few nuggets of oversimplified policy talking points to pepper throughout his rants, and he’s going to be your gaudy QVC host pitching the crappy product to his base. The bonus is that none of it actually has to be true, it just needs to be acceptable to the right people and truthfully exposed or documented by journalists whom he can then dismiss as the fake news media. More broadly, the real terror of the past three and a half years boils down to this: The consolidation of power by some of the most vile figures and interests in the Republican party. This includes the scores of federal judges named to the bench, the shaping of the Supreme Court, the radical drive toward deregulation, and the canceling of even the most minimal commitments the U.S. has made to try to confront climate change. What the Republicans have managed to accomplish on a policy level in Trump’s time in office is profound and terrifying. Out in full view, Trump has presided over the separation of families and the locking up of immigrant children in cages, empowering ICE agents to act as storm troopers. He has intervened to protect war criminals from accountability, threatened to kill the families of suspected terrorists, sought to ban — and in some ways has succeeded in banning — Muslims from entering the country. His threat to fill Guantanamo prison back up still looms, especially in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Is it so hard to imagine it becoming a disease-ridden black hole for migrants seeking refuge? Trump’s economic policies have enriched corporations and special interest groups beyond their imaginations, while sawing off the already inadequate social programs in this country. We still have no idea of the extent to which Trump and his family are financially benefiting from his presidency. He talks about women in disgusting ways, including attempting to publicly humiliate the women he is accused of raping and assaulting. And the sick reality is that a significant number of people in the U.S. clearly like these things even if they won’t openly admit it, though a disturbing number of them do feel emboldened to admire it. Trump has offered up an IPO on ignorance and hatred as a source of pride, and a lot of people enthusiastically bought in. Donald Trump’s presidency is not an aberration of U.S. history in substance. His rise to power and the policies he has implemented are, in many ways, the logical product of the U.S. as a failed state, politically and functionally. Trump says the quiet parts about the system out loud, but his agenda is firmly rooted in the bloody history of this republic. And his rise was made possible by the failed two-party system and the corporate dominance of electoral politics in the U.S. Also, let’s not pretend that congressional Democrats have not enabled Trump by regularly voting for his obscene military budgets and sweeping surveillance powers while simultaneously calling him the most dangerous president in history. What would happen if Trump wins the election in November? In practical terms, it would be a nightmare. Trump would emerge emboldened beyond imagination. What minuscule restraints that currently exist would be wiped out entirely. He would almost certainly be in a position to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with yet another atrocious extremist. An ability to further stack the court will have a multigenerational impact on a legion of issues; among them are voting rights, civil liberties, corporate power, workers’ rights, civil rights, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, executive power, and the climate. No one should minimize the dangers of Trump remaining in office. And his reign will hit the most vulnerable the hardest, much like the coronavirus, and the terrors will ricochet for many years to come. Trump encourages and emboldens racists and bigots and embraces far-right ideology and action. Four more years of this will be deadly. IT IS IN contemplating all of the above that the emergence of Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s presumptive choice to take on Trump is a deeply disturbing and risky response to the threats we face. It is easy to underestimate Biden’s chance of winning in November. Biden is a terrible candidate in many ways, but it is possible that “I’m not Trump” combined with Biden having been Obama’s vice president will appeal to enough of the population to win not only the popular vote (a virtual certainty) but the Electoral College — especially if the party keeps him under wraps until the final stretch, as appears to be the strategy. Still, that seems to be a dangerous gamble given what is at stake. There is also another factor that must not be ignored: Republicans are masters of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. That, combined with Trump’s core belief that corruption isn’t corrupt if he does it places an ominous cloud over the election’s integrity before it even occurs. And we know that the pandemic will cast a long enough shadow over normal life that there will be plenty of opportunities for irregularities. Biden has an abominable public policy record on a wide range of issues. He has a penchant for lying — about his role in the civil rights movement and about being arrested in apartheid South Africa. He continues to lie and mislead about his support for the war in Iraq, the most consequential foreign policy decision of the post-Vietnam era. He has been accused by eight women of misconduct, including one allegation of very serious sexual assault by his former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Biden’s cognitive health and mental acuity is, to say the least, questionable, particularly when you compare his current performance with videos from just a few years ago. He frequently rambles without a clear point, forgets what office he is running for, and has to rely on teleprompters and notes to make it through interviews and speeches without saying something embarrassing. In numerous interactions with voters, Biden has poked their chests in an aggressive manner; told an immigrant rights activist to “vote for Trump”; called voters childish names; and threatened a union worker in Detroit, telling the man to stop objecting to Biden pointing his finger in his face unless the worker “want[s] to go outside with me.” Let’s not even discuss the tale of his showdown with a rusty razor-wielding “Corn Pop” at the pool. Trump’s temperament is frightening, but Biden isn’t exactly a cool head who exudes competence or confidence. Liberals may poo poo the whole Hunter Biden-Burisma-Ukraine-China attacks from Trump, but this is going to be a problem in the general election. On many of the key issues where Democrats could attack Trump, Biden is going to be virtually incapacitated by his own skeletons. What Sen. Elizabeth Warren did to Mike Bloomberg at a February debate would be impossible for Biden to do to Trump. “You have more allegations of sexual assault than I do, Donald,” is not a good line. “Your sons have profited off the presidency more than my son did off my vice presidency” — also not a winning zinger. And don’t think for a moment that Trump won’t hammer away on Biden’s Iraq War vote and his trade policies. The Democratic primary is not the general election. There is no point to going through and listing all of the terrible aspects of Biden’s career, his policy record, his mental stamina, or his substantial failures to make himself visible or consistently cogent since securing the presumptive nomination. All of this is going to be put on display for the next six months. The Democratic Party and the voters in the roughly 50 percent of primaries that were held have committed our fate to Biden’s candidacy. Obama and other senior party leaders, major news organizations, and a lot of money deployed to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders also played a role in manufacturing this reality. Sanders ending his campaign and vowing to support Biden leaves people with two viable candidates on the ballot. Barring a health crisis or death of one of these older men, the only two candidates with enough public support to win the presidency will be Donald Trump and Joe Biden. What we get with Trump is as clear as it is terrifying. What we get with Biden, in his current form, is less apparent. Biden will have a team of competent (for better and worse) technocrats and, in all likelihood, an incredibly influential vice president and an unelected chief of staff running the show. Biden’s administration will also include appointments aimed at throwing some bones to progressives and likely other Cabinet appointments that recognize the growing influence of progressive ideas. It will, without a doubt, also be riddled with a disproportionate number of hawkish, corporatist Democratic apparatchiks. It will be an administration that does the bidding of Wall Street, believes in bloated war budgets, and will put a friendlier face on the worst excesses of empire. It’s always worth remembering that Biden was picked in 2008 to make Obama less threatening to moderates — so we can’t even bank on a return to Obama’s brand of neoliberalism. But there will be policy areas where some victories may be possible for a well-organized and militant left willing to take Biden on. Such a dynamic wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world and would be better for more people than a second Trump term in virtually every tangible way. Biden isn’t great on many issues that motivate young voters. His health care plan keeps the profit-driven system intact, and it will result in millions of Americans remaining uninsured. His policy to confront massive student and consumer debt is anemic. Biden’s climate plan is uninspiring and generally milquetoast when weighed against the severity of the crisis the planet faces, though this is an area in which he might be susceptible to pressure from activists. Some of his foreign policy positions are downright disturbing, if not explicitly right-wing. The latest Biden campaign ad is a fearmongering attack on China and an effort to outbid Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric. Biden’s long record indicates that he could prove more inclined to authorize military interventions than Trump, who has been quite belligerent himself, without following through on most of his threats. Biden is almost certainly going to start and continue wars, impose deadly economic sanctions, and support or enact regime change efforts. There is an abundance of justification to oppose a Biden presidency. And principled people are right to ring loud alarms over Biden’s record, policies, and some of his personal conduct. At the same time, it is not honest to imply there would be no difference between a Biden and Trump administration. The Obama-Biden administration’s immigration policy has now been dwarfed in awfulness by Trump, but in its own right it operated as a cruel, mass deportation machine that also separated families. During the campaign, Biden has responded to extraordinary activist pressure and eventually began to carefully distance himself from the record of the “deporter in chief,” as Obama was labeled by immigrant rights activists. When pressed on the mass deportations under Obama, Biden acknowledged that deporting people without criminal records was a “big mistake.” At a Democratic debate, Biden was asked whether he would resume Obama’s torrid pace of deportations. “Absolutely not,” he said, adding that he was vice president, not president, drawing a rebuke from Julián Castro, who observed accurately that Biden was content to bathe in the glow of his former Obama boss while looking to sidestep responsibility for his more unpopular policies. At the same time, Biden’s campaign has made a sweeping series of pledges that he could implement as president that would potentially protect millions of vulnerable people. On immigration, the alternative to that is four more years of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, an extremist nut who shouldn’t be allowed within 100 feet of a consequential decision-making process. Biden has pledged to immediately lift the Muslim travel ban, as well as other racist immigration and asylum policies Trump has put in place. It is also worth noting that toward the end of the Obama administration, under pressure from Black Lives Matter activists, Obama placed a dozen city police forces under Department of Justice consent decrees in response to police killings and other abuses. Trump cannot be pressured by BLM, but Biden can. Biden has a troubling record on Iran, including his support for deadly sanctions, but he has emphatically said he would reenter the Iran nuclear agreement, which is also no small matter. Similarly, Biden has been politically forced to denounce the genocidal Saudi war against Yemen, despite the fact that it was initiated under the Obama-Biden administration. He has also had to publicly accept that viewing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as an unsavory murderer is now widely held by many Democrats, including centrist figures. Remarkably, Biden has vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into “a pariah.” That’s an incredible statement given the long bipartisan love affair with the kingdom’s despots and raises all sorts of questions about what that would mean if Biden is elected. Former US Vice President and Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden arrives to speak about COVID-19, known as the Coronavirus, during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware on March 12, 2020. Among the wild cards of a Biden administration will be the issue of whether he has the actual mental stamina to govern, or if he is going to be frequently disoriented and infrequently seen or heard. Setting aside the protestations of people who pretend they don’t see exactly what everyone else does when Biden speaks in public, we are not actually being asked to vote for Biden as the candidate, because the Biden we see is a shell of his former self. We are being asked to vote for a spin-off of the Obama show, a cast of familiar characters and a few exciting new additions who would take charge of the executive branch, without the popular star of the original show among the visible cast. The fact that the Democrats have forced through a candidate that many people don’t believe is fully functional and will rely on the strength of “the team” assembled around him is a pretty grim statement about the state of democracy in the U.S. If Biden is the best the Democrats have to offer in the face of Trump, the system is rotten. So what should people who want Trump gone but cannot stand Biden do? First of all, no one should be shamed for letting their conscience dictate their vote or decision not to vote. (Full disclosure: I always vote.) Our system is dominated by corporate influence, big money, and the skewed rules of a default duopoly, and it actively fights to prevent third parties from receiving federal matching funds, joining debates, or gaining ballot access. There is no mandatory voting in the U.S., roughly 40 percent of Americans do not belong to either major political party, and people have a right to register their dissatisfaction with the entire system by not voting. In an atmosphere where tens of millions of U.S. citizens choose not to vote, shaming the minuscule number of people who vote for the Green Party is a disgrace. There are hundreds of thousands of voters whose principled belief is that breaking the two-party stranglehold on U.S. democracy is the only path to meaningful systemic change. Votes for Jill Stein or Howie Hawkins are not being taken away from corporate Democrats. Those votes belong to the people who cast them and they have a right to vote however they choose, and the candidates they support have a right to run for office. It is also an understandable and morally principled decision to say, “I believe Tara Reade was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden, and I will not vote for a rapist.” It is an understandable and morally principled position to say, “I will not vote for anyone who supported the war against Iraq.” None of these people’s votes belong to Biden or Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party or Twitter mobs — and they are not votes for Trump. Ultimately, however, given the abomination of our two-party system, progressive voters are forced to make not just a moral but a strategic choice with their votes. Recognizing that Biden is a terrible candidate and being honest about that but voting for him in an effort to prevent Trump from further consolidating his agenda is a strategically sound position. This is ultimately what the majority of Sanders supporters will do, just as they did in 2016. It certainly has a better chance of improving the country and the world than enthusiastically pledging to vote for Biden while closing your ears to everything that is wrong about him and his record. Voters in swing states, where voting for a candidate other than Biden or not voting at all may help tip the balance to Trump, face a more consequential moral and strategic choice than people in New York or California. In 2004, the Green Party candidate told his supporters to vote their conscience in swing states, including if they believed they needed to hold their nose and vote for John Kerry to defeat Bush. If you believe that progressives or leftists should be “bending the knee” for Biden by promising right this second that they will vote for him in six months and that they will never utter an inconvenient fact about him or express their anger with their meager Election Day options, please show them all of your work fighting for Medicare for All, for ending the carceral state, for serious radical action on climate change, your work opposing the most dangerous aspects of the Obama-Biden administration, including on issues of war, immigration, and, yes, health care. Many of the social and political movements that backed Sanders were populated by people in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. It was an incredibly diverse coalition of supporters and drew millions of primary voters in 2016 and 2020. Its backbone was young voters, including young African Americans, Latinos, students, immigrants, and independents. These groups and many of Sanders’s supporters have spent nearly four years fighting Trump nonstop. Many of them organized against Obama’s troubling policies before that. That should be commended not scorned. You want to label these people Trump supporters because they are intensely disturbed by the corporatist candidate you have chosen to take on Trump? Show them your work on the issues they care about, explain what Biden’s policies are on those issues and make the most convincing case you can for why they should vote for him. Better yet, explain to them how you are fighting to make Biden’s platform one that even minimally pretends to want their votes. In the bigger picture, Sanders organized the most significant challenge to the Democratic Party’s centrist and center-right establishment since Jesse Jackson ran twice for president in the 1980s. Unlike Ralph Nader’s independent runs for president, Sanders attempted to deliver sweeping change within the Democratic Party’s own framework. He fought against an extremely hostile corporate media environment and some pretty vile smear campaigns, where he was compared to the coronavirus, his supporters were called brown shirts, and his primary victories described as akin to the Nazi invasion of France on liberal TV networks. Despite the powerful chorus of red-baiting and lies, Sanders still came extremely close to pulling off a victory. Biden was usually the frontrunner and always the favorite, even though he came close to being defeated by Sanders early on. The establishment fiercely defended its territory in an effort capped off by the last-minute secret diplomacy from Obama ahead of Super Tuesday to pressure other candidates and the party to coalesce around Biden. Ultimately, the party’s primary voters, at the crucial moment, threw their weight behind a name they know and who served as vice president of an administration they trusted. These voters should not be collectively shamed either. Most of them are not party cogs, but people genuinely scared of what four more years of Trump will mean for their survival, particularly older African American voters. The traditional, moderate, and right-wing forces within the Democratic Party united and won the primary battle. Sanders may have surrendered too early, but there is little value to debating that right now or wasting energy attacking Sanders. The war for the future of the Democratic Party is intensifying. There is a possibility of a fracture or at least more clearly defined factions within the party. There will be serious discussions around forming a new party that isn’t the Green Party, but rather an outgrowth of the “Not Me, Us” framework of the Sanders campaign and the growing popularity of groups like the Justice Democrats, the Sunrise Movement, prison abolitionists, immigrant rights groups, and Democratic Socialists of America. It would be a great thing for this country to have a democratic socialist party grow, one that runs serious political campaigns. We have already seen early stage efforts at this with mixed results. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez understands the need to engage in strategic partnerships with establishment Democrats to achieve meaningful policy change and strengthen the areas of common ground. But there will need to be a lot more like-minded politicians elected for the strategy to succeed. This primary has shaken the Democratic establishment to its core, and that is a good thing and should be built on. But none of that is going to happen before November. Some Sanders supporters who are deeply concerned by the candidacy of Biden have said he can have their vote but not their soul. For many people that will be their strategic rationale. For others, it will be a question of individual or collective morality in the face of Trump’s horrors. Leftist voters in swing states shoulder a greater moral burden than the rest of us, and many will decide to vote against Trump by pulling the lever for Biden. There are also very vocal opponents of Biden who are fed up and are flat out going to refuse to vote for him. They recognize that the opposite of Trump is not Biden. They want a society where free health care is a right and wars are ended, where everyone has housing and work that pays livable wages, where you don’t amass a mountain of debt to get an education, and one that treats immigrants and workers with dignity and defends a woman’s absolute right to choose. They want the racist justice system dismantled and ICE to be abolished. They believe we are in a climate emergency and that Biden is a part of the problem. Mainstream Democrats tell them they want much of that too and electing Biden is a strategic step in that direction or that President Biden will be more susceptible to progressive pressure. They reject that. They don’t believe that forcing a choice between two bad candidates is right, even if one is admittedly worse. Electing Biden might solve some problems, but it also could result in a strengthening of the far right in the U.S. and could produce a worse threat than Trump in 2024. A Biden administration, they believe, will undoubtedly be a massive corporate-friendly juggernaut that wages military and economic wars and, for them, voting in the affirmative for that is a bridge too far. And many of these people hold the Democratic Party responsible for Trump because of the terrible campaign it ran in 2016, so trying to convince them to buy into the same strategy twice is a losing battle. They are tired of being Democrats’ cheap dates — treated with contempt, offered few and paltry concessions, and expected to go along. As a strategic matter, at this juncture, they regard supporting Biden as tantamount to telling Democrats to continue to take them for granted. If Democrats want to try to win them over, they should use the next six months to show them you take their concerns about 2016 seriously and map out the ways this campaign is different. Most people on the left who oppose Biden but also view Trump as the gravest danger are going to vote against Trump by voting for Biden. But those who disagree with that strategy do not support Trump. For them, “He’s not Trump” is not a gamble worth taking. The onus is on the Biden campaign and its supporters to make their case to every eligible voter in this country and earn their votes. No one should be taken for granted. Israel’s War on Gaza Jeremy Scahill While pushing its tired narrative about Biden “losing patience,"" the White House remains dedicated to Israel’s war on Gaza.

We need your help. More Info Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at a rally at Belle Isle Casino in Detroit, Mich., Oct. 31, 2020, which former President Barack Obama also attended. (AP) The video posted on TikTok features Joe Biden saying: “Folks we got a lot of work to do. I don’t only need you to get me elected, I need you once I’m elected.” The word “only” isn’t enunciated clearly. But the context of that speech and similar speeches make it clear that Biden is telling people that he needs their support to get him elected. A video posted on TikTok falsely implies that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is plotting election fraud. ""Biden says he doesn’t need voters to get elected,"" said text over a short video of Biden speaking during a campaign stop in Michigan. ""That’s not suspicious…."" The video features Biden saying: ""Folks we got a lot of work to do. I don’t only need you to get me elected, I need you once I’m elected."" The word ""only"" isn’t enunciated clearly. But the context of that speech and similar speeches make it clear that Biden is telling people that he needs their support to get him elected — and that they should stay involved should he be elected. Political organizations and press teams for candidates typically send reporters the text of speeches public figures will make in high-profile events. Likewise, Biden’s press team often sends reporters Biden’s ""remarks as prepared for delivery."" The campaign sent such information for an Oct. 31 campaign event Biden had in Detroit. That prepared text shows that Biden was expected to say that day (emphasis ours): ""It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done with the chaos. The tweets. The anger. The hate. The failure. The irresponsibility. We’ve got a lot of work to do. And if I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act."" Biden’s actual delivery varied slightly from those remarks, saying instead: ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home, as the president said, we're done with the chaos, with the tweets, with the anger, with the hate, with the failure, with irresponsibility. Folks we got a lot of work to do. I don't only need you to get me elected. I need you once I'm elected. Because if i'm elected your president, we're going to get things done."" (The ""as the president said"" is a reference to former president Barack Obama, who spoke on stage before Biden.) The same day in Flint, Mich., Biden similarly said: ""It's time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We're done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, refusing to take any responsibility. We've got a lot of work to do, got a lot of work to do. If I'm elected your president, we're going to do it. We're going to act."" Biden’s speeches in Michigan urged Americans to vote, contrary to the claim in the video on TikTok. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that Biden throughout his campaign has expressed the sentiment of needing voters' support when they cast their ballot and after that process. In August, Biden spoke at a virtual conference organized by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. After being introduced, Biden said: ""If I have the honor of being elected president, I want to thank you for your opening remarks because, you know, and I'm going to need you if I get elected. Not just getting elected, if I get elected."" A video posted on TikTok claimed, ""Biden says he doesn’t need voters to get elected."" That’s a misrepresentation of Biden’s remarks in Michigan.

,Why Biden should be thankful it's not 2024 yet,"And what some other politicians might be feeling grateful for this week. Welcome to 538’s politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited. tia.yang (Tia Yang, editor/reporter): It’s Thanksgiving week, and the presidential turkeys have already been pardoned. Liberty and Bell, this year’s lucky birds from Minnesota, are surely thankful to be heading back home this holiday season. And with most politicians doing the same, here at 538, we thought we’d chat about what we think some of them might be feeling thankful for. We’ll start at the top with President Joe Biden, who just turned 81 on Monday. Maybe his birthday wish was for some better polling heading into 2024. But what does the president have to be thankful for this Thanksgiving? leah.askarinam (Leah Askarinam, politics reporter): That current horse-race polling isn't predictive. nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): Hahaha. leah.askarinam: Did I steal yours? nrakich: You didn't steal mine, but I was going to say, it's an awkward time to be asking what Biden should be thankful for, given the polling slump he’s in! His average approval rating has fallen below 40 percent in 538's tracker. There's a lot of dissatisfaction among his base about his handling of issues like the economy and the war in Israel-Gaza. And he trails former President Donald Trump in most general-election polls. leah.askarinam: Right. Recent polls have yielded some bad news for Biden — for example, his approval rating declined to his lowest ever in the latest NBC poll, which is widely respected among politicos. But even more interesting to me was how NBC summed up a slew of other record-breaking bad numbers that poll included for Biden. For example, it's the first time the poll found Biden behind Trump in a hypothetical general-election matchup. And one of the pollsters, Republican Bill McInturff, told NBC that the impact the Israel-Hamas war has had was unprecedented, because foreign affairs don't usually hit American presidents quite this hard. Perhaps Biden could be thankful that outlier polls exist and could potentially account for some of the bad numbers, although it seems unlikely given recent trends. nrakich: Yeah. But I think your first point is absolutely right, Leah — Biden can be thankful that this is November 2023, not November 2024. I'm skeptical that the Israel-Hamas war is going to stay in the headlines long enough to be one of the deciding issues of the 2024 general election. It's a long campaign. We're in a bad news cycle for Biden right now. But there is time for several more news cycles to come and go before Election Day. Including some news cycles that will probably be bad for Trump! And that's what I think Biden should be thankful for: the fact that he is very likely going to be running against Trump, who is almost as unpopular as he is, who may very well be convicted of multiple crimes in the next year, and who has a unique ability to energize the Democratic base. If you think the polls are bad for Biden against Trump, take a look at his polls against former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. A Fox News poll that put Biden 4 points behind Trump nationally put him 11 points behind Haley. A Marquette Law School poll that put Biden 2 points behind Trump nationally (among likely voters) put him 12 points behind Haley. Now, I don't think Haley would win by that much (no one has won the popular vote by more than 9 points since 1984). But I think if Republicans nominated anyone but Trump, they would be favorites to win back the White House in 2024. tia.yang: Plus the fact that Biden’s silver lining is that he’s running against someone almost as unpopular as he is only underlines the fact that he's less popular than Trump. Heading into the 2020 election, Trump was nearly as unpopular as he is now, but Biden's favorability was in positive territory. Now Biden is the unpopular incumbent. That could be bad news for him when it comes to turning out his base. leah.askarinam: Right, they're both quite unpopular. But I still think Trump has a harder ceiling than Biden, and the biggest threat to a Biden victory is voters staying at home or voting third-party. But to that point, I'd add to Biden's list of things to be thankful for that the off-year elections indicate that voters are still responding to messaging on protecting abortion rights. A new Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found a record-breaking share of Americans — 55 percent — say women should be able to get an abortion for any reason. tia.yang: Good point, Leah. A September NBC poll found that voters trust Democrats over Republicans on abortion (and health care) more than on any other issue, and we can expect them to continue emphasizing that issue to drive turnout. Let's move on to the other side of the horse race. Nathaniel, what do you think Trump's feeling thankful for? nrakich: Haha, my snarky answer is that Trump should be thankful for the fact that he'll probably run against Biden! The same things I said above for Biden go for Trump too: If Democrats had a younger, less unpopular nominee like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer or Sen. Raphael Warnock, Trump would be a serious underdog. But instead, Trump will probably run against one of the only politicians in America who’s more unpopular than he is. leah.askarinam: I think there's a slight unknown there though, Nathaniel. We know that Biden versus Trump is basically a dead heat at this point, because Biden's weaknesses are, theoretically, manageable for Democrats. He can still run on abortion rights and preserving democracy, even if voters think that as a human being he is simply too old to be president. He won't win a landslide, but he can certainly win the presidency anyway. To compare this to Biden’s odds against a more popular Republican, the only reason we know Haley fares well on a national stage is because ... she is running for president and is faring decently on a national stage. But we don't know how Whitmer or Warnock would fare on a national stage until we see one of them on it. nrakich: That's fair! tia.yang: That same Fox News poll that had Biden trailing Haley also found Trump leading Democratic alternatives like Whitmer and Vice President Kamala Harris in a theoretical matchup. But as Leah said, these matchups are more hypothetical than, say, Haley versus Biden. Leah, what about you? What else should Trump be thankful for? leah.askarinam: Trump should be thankful that the latest round of polling that declares Nikki Haley is ""surging"" in New Hampshire also means that she finally made it into the double digits. In other words, Trump should be thankful that he's so far ahead in the GOP primary polls! tia.yang: Right. While Haley's polling looks good in a theoretical matchup against Biden, it's not looking so good against Trump. A recent Harvard CAPS-Harris poll of registered Republican voters found her at 19 percent to Trump's 81 percent in a head-to-head primary race. nrakich: Yeah, my alternative answer was going to be that Trump should be thankful that Republican voters are still so loyal to him, even after he lost in 2020. Historically, parties usually want nothing to do with their losing presidential nominees — Democrats moved on quickly from Hillary Clinton after 2016, Republicans from Mitt Romney after 2012. But not Trump after 2020. Of course, maybe that's not too surprising when you consider that 69 percent of Republicans believe Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. tia.yang: Trump does hate losing, so he’s definitely thankful for that! Let’s pivot to the legislative branch. In the wake of a House speakership crisis and amid a looming government shutdown, public approval for Congress has been as low as 13 percent in recent polls — 538’s approval tracker had it at its lowest point all year at the end of October. But after 10 straight weeks in session, Speaker Mike Johnson’s House managed to avoid (or at least delay) a holiday season shutdown by punting the next federal funding deadline to January. What does Johnson have to be thankful for? leah.askarinam: I would say that Johnson should be thankful that he won enough votes to become speaker, which should indicate that it's not impossible to unite the GOP conference around a single issue. nrakich: Johnson should be thankful that everyone in Congress is tired and just wants to go home, haha. In order to keep the government open, Johnson had to compromise with Democrats and pass a continuing resolution. In other words, he had to do exactly what former Speaker Kevin McCarthy did. In both cases, the House Freedom Caucus was outraged — but while McCarthy famously lost his job for his transgressions, Johnson still has his. Someone could have very easily tried to file a motion to vacate the chair against Johnson too. But I think, after all the chaos in the House in October after McCarthy was ousted, the appetite just wasn't there for that. leah.askarinam: So, should Johnson be thankful that the right wing of the Republican Party ousted McCarthy? nrakich: I guess so, Leah? Assuming that being speaker of the House is actually something to be thankful for ... leah.askarinam: That is a leap indeed, Nathaniel. But I do think Johnson ended up being the right person at the right time, and that's something to be thankful for. nrakich: In all seriousness, though, the speakership seems to me like a thankless, nearly impossible job right now, given the slim majority Republicans are working with. Honestly, I think McCarthy should be thankful that he doesn't have to worry about it anymore. tia.yang: Yeah, to address Leah's first point about GOP unity, I'm skeptical anyone could unite the GOP conference around spending issues. It’s going to be an uphill battle for Johnson. Even before he got the funding extension passed, many were noting that the new speaker’s honeymoon period with conservatives seemed to have ended — and that seems even more true after he passed it. leah.askarinam: Right. Maybe Johnson should just be thankful for his friends and family, because work is going to be tough. tia.yang: To that point, I think all members of Congress are probably pretty thankful not only to be home for Thanksgiving, but for the absence of a government funding deadline right before Christmas or New Year’s, thanks to Johnson’s CR that extended current funding through Jan. 19 or Feb. 2. This is the first time in over a decade (since 2012) that Congress doesn’t have at least one government funding deadline in the month of December. Last year it passed an omnibus spending bill on Dec. 23, and in 2021, it set five different funding deadlines in December alone. So while he may have run out his rope with hardline conservatives, the fact that Johnson got this funding extension passed at all could do a lot to cool things down after a particularly testy November in Congress. He’s the speaker who saved Christmas! On brand for him. nrakich: Yeah, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" is not a Christmas movie! leah.askarinam: So, if Johnson saves Christmas, who's the grinch? tia.yang: Chip Roy would love to declare himself the grinch. But seriously, the Freedom Caucus and anti-establishment wing that ousted McCarthy over cutting that initial spending deal stands ready to be the grinch in this scenario. As Nathaniel noted, they gave Johnson a pass this time, but they’re not happy that he extended funding at fiscal 2023 levels, which were set by Democrats back in 2022. What about elsewhere in Congress? What other Thanksgiving hot takes do you guys have? leah.askarinam: Well, since you asked: I think the first-term Republican congressmen from New York who are facing tough elections in November 2024 are thankful for the House Ethics Committee report that alleged “substantial evidence” that Rep. George Santos paid for personal expenses with campaign funds. Santos announced he won't seek reelection, but he faces a major threat before that, with a resolution to expel him from Congress expected to come to the floor after Thanksgiving. I think some Suffolk County and New York Republican Party leaders will be thankful, too. Santos's antics in Congress just weren't a good look while other New York Republicans are making the case to voters that, despite the ""R"" next to their name, they're common-sense politicians who can represent Biden voters' interests. Santos, meanwhile, will still allegedly have some things to be thankful for, including, according to the House Ethics report, what should be truly fantastic skin, made possible by spa visits and Botox. nrakich: Haha. Santos should be thankful that he still has his job — at least for now. Ahead of the expected vote on whether to expel him next week, I guess Santos should also be thankful that it requires a two-thirds vote to expel a member and that only five representatives in history have ever been expelled. leah.askarinam: And he already survived another resolution to expel him recently! It's not over! tia.yang: It says a lot about how bad a look Santos has been for New York Republicans that they were the ones leading that initial charge to oust him — right after the GOP speaker battle emphasized how much every Republican vote counts with such a small majority. Nathaniel, what's your parting Thanksgiving hot take? nrakich: I think this is a pretty cold take, but Mitch McConnell should be thankful for the 2024 Senate map. Needing just one or two flips to take control of the Senate (depending on who wins the vice presidency), Republicans have three great pickup opportunities in states that Trump carried by at least 8 points in 2020: West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. McConnell should be extra thankful that Joe Manchin, the Democratic incumbent in West Virginia, decided not to run for reelection, which virtually assures that Republicans will pick up that seat. Sorry, that was not nearly as fun as Leah's. leah.askarinam: I think McConnell should be thankful for his position in general — he gets to be the grown-up in the room next door to a chaotic House conference, and he doesn’t have run for reelection himself in 2024, since his term ends in 2026. And, I think there might be a long list of Republicans who would be thankful for a Joe Manchin presidential run! He’s openly considering one, lamenting that Biden has gone “too far left.” tia.yang: Manchin going from Senate kingmaker to presidential election spoiler would be a maximally chaotic power move from him. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ",https://abcnews.go.com/538/biden-thankful-2024/story?id=105065948,
,South Carolina Democratic primary: Are black voters losing faith in Joe Biden?,"Black voters were a key part of the coalition that helped Joe Biden win the White House, and he will need their overwhelming support to do it again. In South Carolina, however, many are frustrated with the president - and some are backing Donald Trump. A 40-minute drive from the sparkle and polish of Columbia, South Carolina, is the town of Winnsboro, which lacks both. It's a place Nocola Hemphill calls home - a home which, as she describes it, sounds like it's a world away from the state capital. Empty streets, abandoned businesses and vacant homes. Joblessness. Hopelessness. It's been that way for years, she says. ""There's no one reaching down here to lift anyone up. You have to wonder, does anyone really care?"" The 47-year-old is the CEO of the US Black Women's Chamber of Commerce, an organisation supporting small business development for black women across the country, an effort she says hasn't been noticeably aided by the Biden administration. ""I voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but I'm still waiting,"" Hemphill says. ""I'm still waiting on tangible change for my vote - for my people."" Just a few days before the Democratic primary election in her state - the first contest in the process to formally pick the party's presidential candidate - she wasn't sure if he still had her vote. And she's not alone. A recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Other surveys suggest black voters are warming to Donald Trump, the current Republican frontrunner and President Biden's likely November opponent. These are votes the president cannot afford to lose. His 2020 win over Mr Trump was in part driven by black voters. They helped him win in critical swing states, including Georgia, where a historic black voter turnout made Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1992. Todd Shaw, a University of South Carolina political science professor, told the BBC that if Mr Biden fails to get a strong showing from black voters from the state in Saturday's primary, it could spell trouble for his campaign for re-election.""Black voters in South Carolina mirror trends among black voters nationally. So, what happens here could be an indicator of what's to come."" President Biden pushed hard to change his party's rules so that South Carolina is the first state to vote in the nomination process. A Biden campaign adviser told the BBC the move was intended ""to make sure the process reflected the diversity of our party"". Over a quarter of South Carolina's population is black. And it was South Carolina's black voters who saved Biden's lacklustre bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 by handing him his first win. ""You're the reason I'm president,"" Mr Biden told a mostly black crowd in the state one evening in January. ""You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser, and you're the reason we're gonna win and beat him again."" It was one of several stops Mr Biden and his supporters have made in South Carolina this year, smiling for cameras at historically black colleges, shaking hands at barbershops, all the while, reminding voters of the ""record achievements"" his administration has made in their communities. The BBC spoke to lots of voters in the state who do support the president - and he's expected to win the primary comfortably. For many South Carolina black voters, however, the president's words feel disconnected from their realities. Kenard Holmes, a junior at South Carolina State University (SCSU), told the BBC he was not excited by Mr Biden's campaign. ""I know I'm going to vote. I'm just not sure who I'm voting for."" The 20-year-old remains unconvinced of the historic investments the White House says it has made into black colleges like his. In the university building where Holmes meets weekly with his gospel choir, he says conditions are ""embarrassing"". ""If it's cold outside, it's cold in there. If it's hot outside, it's hot in there,"" Holmes says. ""It's been like that for years."" Data shows that other black voters in South Carolina have similar reasons to be disenchanted. In 2022, eight of the state's top 10 counties with the highest poverty rates were majority black - averaging over 27%. And in more bustling areas like Charleston, US census data shows poverty rates were nearly twice as high in one of the city's majority-black neighbourhoods compared to its majority-white county. Although the state is run by Republicans, there is a sense the president could have done more. Matthew Guah, the dean of SCSU's business school, agrees that although money has been invested into black communities, it hasn't been substantive enough to move the needle. ""Record investment just means more than before. Record investment doesn't mean they got everything they need,"" he says. Ronnie Bennett, co-owner of the Broughton Street Cafe in Orangeburg County, told the BBC: ""If Biden has put money into black communities, I don't see it."" Ms Bennett plans to vote for Joe Biden again but mostly out of obligation, feeling Democrats offer her the most hope. ""Our ancestors fought for the right to vote, so we exercise that right whether we like who's running or not,"" she says. Her shop is located in Orangeburg's downtown historic district, less than a mile away from SCSU. Deserted sidewalks, boarded windows and crumbling buildings hug the downtown streets, save for a scant number of new businesses like Bennett's. The cafe's freshly painted exterior and colourful wood-warmed interior injected vibrancy into the neighbourhood when it opened in 2022, but little has come after, Bennett says. Others are eager to support Mr Biden, alarmed by the possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House. Cecil Williams is the owner of the South Carolina Civil Rights Museum, where relics from one of the darkest chapters in American history are showcased. Inside, an original copy of The Clansman - the early 20th Century novel glamourising the Ku Klux Klan - sits just feet away from emptied shotgun shells used by police to kill unarmed black student protestors on SCSU's campus. The museum's artefacts are relics of a racist past that Williams fears Donald Trump is rekindling. The former president has faced accusations of racism - which he denies - including for pushing the false claim that Barack Obama was not born in America and for telling four minority congresswoman to ""go back"" to where they came from. ""We need someone like Joe Biden in the White House now more than ever. Just look at the alternative,"" Williams says. ""If we stay home, we lose this election. We can't let that happen."" But as Mr Trump seeks the presidency for a third time, he'll be looking to take advantage of Democrats' shrinking stronghold on black voters. ""That's just an opportunity that we would be remiss if we didn't exploit,"" a senior adviser to the Trump campaign said, according to the Associated Press. In addition to multiple celebrity endorsements from rappers like Lil Wayne and Kodak Black, Mr Trump has increasingly positioned himself on camera with his now-defeated opponent, Tim Scott. Mr Scott, South Carolina's first black US senator, has been widely discussed as a possible vice-presidential pick for Mr Trump. It's an idea Mr Scott seems to be courting. ""I just love you"", he told the former president from the stage after Mr Trump's latest victory in the Republican race. In Winnsboro, where the population barely nudges above 3,000, and the fried chicken gets served at the gas station, voter frustration is not hard to find. There's a barbershop on the town's main street, one of few businesses not permanently closed. Clarence Pauling, the shop's owner, has a quick response for anyone who asks him what he thinks of President Biden: ""I'll never vote for Biden again."" The proposition itself sparks a stir in the small black-owned business. ""Yes Lord!"" one man shouted, listening in while getting his hair cut. ""Giving all that money to Ukraine. You got people right here that need it. We got homeless people sleeping at the bus stop."" Mr Pauling, 49, historically has been a staunch Democratic supporter and says he even used his barbershop to register voters to support Barack Obama during the 2008 and 2012 elections. But not this year. He's strongly considering voting for Donald Trump, a desired change of pace from Mr Biden who he says ""talks a good game, but doesn't deliver"". Others in the barbershop agree and express frustration with the cost of gas and groceries. ""Trump tells the truth,"" says Pauling, laughing as he recalled when Mr Trump frankly told Hillary Clinton that he uses the ""rigged system"" to his advantage. ""I can dig that. I'm tired of everybody trying to be politically correct,"" he said. ""Tell it like it is."" Prospect of nuclear weapons being stored in Suffolk causes concern that they could become a target. The ex-president promoted gold-coloured shoes priced at $399 at a sneaker convention in Philadelphia. Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu vows to carry on the war against Hamas regardless of international pressure. A scathing judgment limits the former president's ability to do business in the city where he made his name. The president says taking a two-week break without passing fresh aid is ""bizarre"" and ""outrageous"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,A deepfake ‘Joe Biden’ robocall told voters to stay home for primary election,"An AI vocal clone confused New Hampshire residents ahead of first-in-the-nation primary. BY ANDREW PAUL | PUBLISHED JAN 22, 2024 3:56 PM EST AI vocal cloning technology is reportedly already muddying the waters ahead of the 2024 election. According to a statement issued by the New Hampshire attorney general’s office on Monday, a robocall campaign deployed over the weekend used an imitation of President Joe Biden’s voice to urge recipients not to vote in the state’s January 23 presidential primary. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” an AI-generated Biden told residents over the phone. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” The disinformation campaign’s orchestrators are currently unknown, but it comes from “obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden,” according to former New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Kathy Sullivan, speaking through NBC News’ initial exclusive report. [Related: Deepfake audio already fools people nearly 25 percent of the time.] AI-generated content including deepfaked audio, video, and imagery is a growing concern among misinformation experts. Multiple reports have warned that today’s media, internet, and social landscapes are unprepared for a likely imminent deluge of falsified “fake news” content as the 2024 presidential election intensifies. A recent study conducted by researchers at the UK’s University College London indicates AI generated audio can fool as many as 1-in-4 listeners. Over 1,600 videos uploaded to YouTube have featured deepfaked celebrities like Taylor Swift and Steve Harvey hawking “medical card” schemes and other scams, collectively amassing over 195 million views in the process. But unlike “free money” ploys from AI Oprah, the latest vocal cloning example is explicitly meant to influence the US political landscape. As for this weekend’s misinfo campaign, the fake Biden falsely claimed an ongoing statewide campaign to write-in his name during New Hampshire’s primary would hurt the president’s reelection prospects. The robocall message then concluded with a phone number linked to Kathy Sullivan, resulting in a flurry of calls on Sunday evening that prompted the former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair to report the situation to the state attorney general’s office. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters,” the state attorney general’s office cautioned in Monday’s statement. Voters were urged to disregard the message, with the office explicitly making clear, “Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election.” [Related: Beware the AI celebrity clones peddling bogus ‘free money’ on YouTube.] Representatives of former President Trump’s campaign have denied any connection to the robocall scheme. Meanwhile a spokesperson for Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota challenging Biden for the Democratic Party nomination, described the scam as “wildly concerning.” “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy,” Phillips campaign representative Katie Dolan told NBC News. “The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing.” At least some Phillips supporters, however, are embracing other AI tool tactics, despite warnings to the contrary. Late last week, The Washington Post noted that Dean.Bot—a chatbot created by a pro-Phillips SuperPAC—had been removed from OpenAI’s recently launched online store for “knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning.” Despite the slap on the wrist, Phillips remains a favorite of some Silicon Valley’s top players. The SuperPAC behind Dean.Bot, We Deserve Better, was co-founded by the former chief of staff for Sam Altman, OpenAI co-founder and recently fired-and-rehired CEO. Altman himself has met with Phillips, although he has yet to endorse or formally donate to the congressman’s campaign. The New Hampshire AG’s statement notes a Department of Justice investigation into the AI presidential robocall is ongoing, and encourages residents to contact the Election Law Unit if they received a message beginning with AI Biden opining, “What a bunch of malarkey.” Andrew Paul is Popular Science's staff writer covering tech news.

"Ruth Igielnik, Scott Keeter and Hannah Hartig",Behind Biden’s 2020 Victory,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  Note (July 2023): A new report about the 2022 validated voters used slightly revised 2020 estimates. There was nothing inaccurate about the 2020 results, but we chose to use a slightly different survey weighting approach that increases the precision of our estimates. None of the substantive findings from the 2020 report have been impacted. See the 2022 methodology for more detail.    The 2020 presidential election was historic in many ways. Amid a global pandemic, with unprecedented changes in how Americans voted, voter turnout rose 7 percentage points over 2016, resulting in a total of 66% of U.S. adult citizens casting a ballot in the 2020 election. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote. While Biden’s popular vote differential was an improvement over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 2-point advantage, it was not as resounding as congressional Democrats’ 9-point advantage over Republicans in votes cast in the 2018 elections for the U.S. House of Representatives. Members of Pew Research Center’s nationally representative American Trends Panel were matched to public voting records from three national commercial voter files in an attempt to find a record for voting in the 2020 election. Validated voters are citizens who told us in a post-election survey that they voted in the 2020 general election and have a record for voting in a commercial voter file. Nonvoters are citizens who were not found to have a record of voting in any of the voter files or told us they did not vote. A new analysis of validated 2020 voters from Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel examines change and continuity in the electorate, both of which contributed to Biden’s victory. It looks at how new voters and voters who turned out in one or both previous elections voted in the 2020 presidential election and offers a detailed portrait of the demographic composition and vote choices of the 2020 electorate. It also provides a comparison with findings from our previous studies of the 2016 and 2018 electorates. A number of factors determined the composition of the 2020 electorate and explain how it delivered Biden a victory. Among those who voted for Clinton and Trump in 2016, similar shares of each – about nine-in-ten – also turned out in 2020, and the vast majority remained loyal to the same party in the 2020 presidential contest. These voters formed substantial bases of support for both Biden and Trump. Overall, there were shifts in presidential candidate support among some key groups between 2016 and 2020, notably suburban voters and independents. On balance, these shifts helped Biden a little more than Trump. Overall, one-in-four 2020 voters (25%) had not voted in 2016. About a quarter of these (6% of all 2020 voters) showed up two years later – in 2018 – to cast ballots in the highest-turnout midterm election in decades. Those who voted in 2018 but not in 2016 backed Biden over Trump in the 2020 election by about two-to-one (62% to 36%). Both Trump and Biden were able to bring new voters into the political process in 2020. The 19% of 2020 voters who did not vote in 2016 or 2018 split roughly evenly between the two candidates (49% Biden vs. 47% Trump). However, as with voters overall, there was a substantial age divide within this group. Among those under age 30 who voted in 2020 but not in either of the two previous elections, Biden led 59% to 33%, while Trump won among new or irregular voters ages 30 and older by 55% to 42%. Younger voters also made up an outsize share of these voters: Those under age 30 made up 38% of new or irregular 2020 voters, though they represented just 15% of all 2020 voters. One somewhat unusual aspect of the 2016 election was the relatively high share of voters (nearly 6%) who voted for one of the third-party candidates (mostly the Libertarian and Green Party nominees), a fact many observers attributed to the relative unpopularity of both major party candidates. By comparison, just 2% of voters chose a third-party candidate in 2020. Overall, third-party 2016 voters who turned out in 2020 voted 53%-36% for Biden over Trump, with 10% opting for a third-party candidate. Among the 5% of Republicans who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, a majority (70%) supported Trump in 2020, but 18% backed Biden. Among the 5% of Democrats who voted third-party in 2016 and voted in 2020, just 8% supported Trump in 2020 while 85% voted for Biden. Here are some of the other key findings from the analysis: This analysis is based on a survey of 11,818 members of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel conducted Nov. 12-17, 2020, shortly after the general election. It also draws on surveys conducted among 10,640 panelists from Nov. 7-16, 2018, after the midterm election that year and 4,183 panelists from Nov. 29 to Dec. 12, 2016, after the general election. Researchers attempted to match the panelists to three different commercial voter files that contain official records of voter registration and turnout for 2016, 2018 and 2020. (For more details, see Methodology.) This study marries official turnout records with a post-election survey among a large, ongoing survey panel, with the goal of improving the accuracy of the results compared with relying on self-reported turnout alone. The survey panel also makes it possible to examine change in turnout and vote preference over time among many of the same individuals. This analysis joins a growing body of research seeking to achieve a more accurate assessment of the 2020 election, each based on somewhat different sources of data.2 Different methods and data sources have unique strengths and weaknesses, meaning that specific estimates are likely to vary among the studies and no single resource can be considered definitive. The 2020 election featured continuity in the voting patterns of major demographic and political groups in the population, but there were a few important shifts. The gender gap in the 2020 election was narrower than it had been in 2016 as Democrats made gains among men and Republicans made gains among women. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump won men by 11 percentage points (52% to 41%) while Hillary Clinton won women by 15 points (54% to 39%). In the 2018 election, Democrats substantially narrowed the gap with men (50% of men voted for Democratic candidates, 48% for Republican candidates) while maintaining an 18-point lead among women. In the 2020 election, men again divided nearly evenly (50% Trump, 48% Biden), while Biden’s advantage narrowed to 11 points among women (55% to 44%). Similarly, as Biden increased his level of support among White men in the 2020 election relative to Clinton’s in 2016, Trump gained among White women, which had the effect of further narrowing the gender gap among White voters. In 2016, Trump won White men by 30 points (62% to 32%). That gap narrowed to a 17-point margin for Trump in 2020 (57% to 40%). White women, a group sometimes categorized as swing voters and who broke nearly evenly in 2016 (47% for Trump to 45% for Clinton), favored him in 2020 (53% to 46%). Biden received the support of 92% of Black voters, nearly the same as Clinton received in 2016 and Democratic candidates for the U.S. House received in 2018. While Biden took a 59% majority of the Hispanic vote, Trump (with 38%) gained significantly over the level of support Republican candidates for the House received in 2018 (25%). To be sure, Hispanic voters are not a monolith; there is substantial diversity within the Hispanic electorate. One noteworthy feature of the 2020 election was the wide education gap among Hispanic voters. In 2020, Biden won college-educated Hispanic voters 69% to 30%. At the same time, Biden’s advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters who did not have a college degree was far narrower (55% to 41%). One of the most pivotal groups in the 2016 election was White voters without a four-year college degree, who were critical to Trump’s electoral college victory that year (nationally, he won them by a wide 36-point margin in 2016, 64% to 28%). Prior to 2016, differences in candidate preferences by education were typically much smaller than they were that year. In 2020, Trump won 65% of White non-college voters – nearly identical to his 2016 share – even as Biden outperformed Clinton among this group (33% of White non-college voters backed Biden, up from the 28% of this group Clinton won in 2016). At the same time, White voters with a college degree or higher supported Biden by roughly the same margin they had backed Clinton in 2016. Trump’s stronghold among White men without a four-year college degree loosened somewhat in 2020. While he still won this group by a little more than two-to one (66% to Biden’s 31%), that 35 percentage point gap is notably smaller than the 50-point gap in the 2016 election, when 73% of White men without a college degree supported Trump, compared with 23% who supported Clinton. Meanwhile, White men with a four-year college degree have become increasingly supportive of Democratic candidates, breaking close to evenly in 2016 (47% for Clinton, 44% for Trump) but supporting Biden by a 10-point margin in 2020. At the same time, Trump’s vote share among White women without a college degree grew slightly between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. In 2016, White, non-college women supported Trump by a margin of 56% to 33%. By 2020, Trump’s vote share rose to 64% among this group compared with 35% supporting Biden. Among white women with a college degree, support for Biden was on par with support for Clinton in 2016 (59%-40% in 2020). Biden and Trump benefited from similar levels of party loyalty in 2020, with Trump receiving 92% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and Biden getting 94% among Democrats and Democratic leaners. Comparable levels of support for each candidate were seen among Democrats (95% for Biden) and Republicans (94% for Trump), not including leaners. Among independents and those who affiliated with other parties, Biden led Trump by 52%-43%. Ideological divisions within the parties were also apparent in the vote, with both Trump and Biden doing better among the ideological core of their parties. Trump received the votes of 97% of conservative Republicans and leaners but a smaller majority (79%) of Republicans who describe themselves as moderate or liberal. Biden took 98% of the vote among liberal Democrats and leaners and 91% among those who are moderate or conservative. A yawning age gap in voter support – a pattern that emerged in the 2004 presidential election for the first time since 1972 – continues to be evident, with voters under 30 favoring Joe Biden by 24 percentage points (Biden 59%, Trump 35%). Perhaps reflecting the enduring impact of this long-term age gap, voters ages 30 to 49 were also solidly in the Democratic candidate’s camp in 2020, favoring Biden by 12 points (55%-43%), similar to Clinton’s share among this age group. By contrast, older age groups divided fairly evenly between Biden and Trump, a result not too different from 2016. These patterns also are apparent when the lens is shifted to birth cohorts, or generations – groups of voters who share birth years and perhaps formative political experiences in common, such as the popularity of the president at the time they were first eligible to vote. Voters in the youngest adult generations today – Generation Z (those ages 18 to 23 in 2020) and the Millennial generation (ages 24 to 39 in 2020) – favored Biden over Trump by a margin of 20 percentage points, though Trump gained 8 points among Millennials compared with his 2016 performance. Generation Xers, those ages 40 to 55 in 2020, divided relatively evenly (51% to 48%), as did Baby Boomers. Only among members of the Silent Generation, ages 75 to 92 in 2020, was Trump clearly favored (by 58%-42%). Notably, Boomers and Silents (and the very small number of voters from the Greatest Generation) made up less than half of the electorate in 2020 (44%), compared with just over half in both 2016 and 2018. The political split between America’s rural areas and its suburban and urban locales remained substantial in 2020. Biden did considerably better among suburban voters in 2020 than Clinton did in 2016 (54% for Biden, 45% for Clinton). By contrast, Trump garnered the support of 65% of rural voters, including 71% of White rural voters; the latter represented an increase over the 62% he received among this group in 2016. Biden received a solid majority of votes among urban residents (66% overall), but Trump gained among urbanites relative to his performance in 2016 (33% in 2020, 24% in 2016). Voters in 2020 sorted along religious lines in ways consistent with recent elections. Protestants constituted nearly half of all voters (46%), as they did in 2016. Within the Protestant tradition, White evangelicals accounted for 19% of all voters, but a much higher share of Trump’s voters (34%). Without such broad support for Trump among White evangelicals, Biden would have beaten him by more than 20 points. White non-evangelical Protestants voted for Trump over Biden by a 14-point margin (57%-43%), while Black Protestants were an overwhelmingly Democratic group (91% voted for Biden). Biden, by contrast, drew strong support from religiously unaffiliated voters – atheists, agnostics, and those who say their religion is “nothing in particular.” Together, these voters made up 25% of voters, which is a slightly larger share of the total electorate than White evangelicals (19%). But support for Biden among the unaffiliated was not quite as lopsided as Trump’s support among White evangelicals (a 45-point margin for Biden among the unaffiliated vs. a 69-point margin for Trump among White evangelicals). Without the religiously unaffiliated, Trump would have had a 9-point popular vote margin over Biden. White non-Hispanic Catholics were more supportive of Biden (at 42%) than they had been of Clinton in 2016 (31%), but Trump still captured a solid majority of their votes (57%). White Catholics made up 14% of all voters. As was the case in the 2016 and 2018 elections, the Democratic voting coalition in 2020 looked quite different from the Republican coalition in several respects. Overall, Biden voters were younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and less likely to live in rural areas than Trump voters. In 2020, 85% of voters who cast a ballot for Trump were White non-Hispanic; this compares with just 61% of Biden voters. These differences are roughly consistent with the share of White voters in each party’s coalition in 2016. Nearly two-in-ten voters who cast a ballot for Biden in the 2020 election (19%) were Black, identical to the share of Clinton voters in 2016 who were Black. That is significantly higher than the share of Trump voters who were Black (2%). The community profiles of Trump and Biden voters are similar in some fundamental ways to the previous two elections – but more voters who cast ballots for Biden in 2020 say they live in a suburban area compared with Clinton’s 2016 voters. Overall, urban voters continue to constitute a larger share of the Democratic coalition compared with the Republican coalition. And rural voters remain a significantly larger portion of the Republican electorate. However, when comparing Clinton’s voters with Biden’s, there are some significant shifts. In 2016, about half of Clinton’s voters described their communities as suburban (48%), while 32% said they were from an urban area and 19% were from a rural area. In 2020, suburban voters made up a majority of Biden’s coalition (55%); 28% of his voters said they lived in urban areas and 17% were from rural areas. In 2020, 31% of Trump voters had at least a four-year college degree – similar to the share of Trump voters who had a college degree in 2016. Far more Trump voters (roughly 70% in each presidential election) did not have a four-year college degree. The Democratic electorate is more evenly divided when it comes to education. In 2020, 46% of Biden voters had at least a college degree; 53% did not have a degree. As was the case in 2016, White voters without a four-year college degree made up a considerably larger share of GOP voters (58%) than Democratic voters (27%). At the same time, White voters with a college degree made up a larger share of Biden voters (34%) than Trump voters (27%). In 2020, the age profiles of Democratic and Republican voters looked largely similar to 2016. Younger adults continue to make up a larger share of Democratic voters compared with Republican voters. For example, in 2020, nearly half of Biden voters (49%) were younger than 50; that compares with 39% of Trump voters in 2020. Protestants made up a majority of those voting Republican in 2020, just as they did in 2016. Overall, 58% of Trump voters were Protestant, compared with just 35% of Biden voters. White evangelical Protestants, in particular, remained a critical part of the Republican voting coalition, making up 34% of Trump’s voters but just 6% of Biden’s. Catholics made up similar shares of Biden and Trump voters (19% and 22%, respectively); in 2016, Catholics made up a slightly higher share of Trump voters compared with Clinton voters (23% vs. 18%). Voters who were unaffiliated with any religious tradition (atheists, agnostics and those who describe themselves as “nothing in particular”) made up 35% of Biden voters but just 14% of Trump voters in 2020. The 2020 election brought a huge change in howAmericans cast their ballots. As some states looked to adapt to challenges in administering elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters were offered expanded access to absentee and vote-by-mail options in the 2020 election. As a result, a record number of voters said they cast their ballots this way (46%). And smaller shares of voters said they either voted in person on Election Day (27%) or in person before Election Day (27%). A majority of absentee voters said they had previously voted this way before the 2020 election (56%). Still, a sizable share (43%) said the November election was the first time they had cast an absentee or mail ballot. Sizable shares of voters across racial and ethnic subgroups cast absentee or mail-in ballots in the 2020 election – though there are some differences in voting methods when comparing across groups. White voters were most likely to say they voted in person on Election Day (30%). Comparably smaller shares of Black (20%) and Hispanic voters (18%) said the same. Black voters were more likely than White or Hispanic voters to say they cast their ballot in person before Election Day (42% of Black voters, vs. 27% of Hispanic voters and 25% of White voters). Voters ages 65 and older stand out in their voting behavior: 55% say they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election – 13 percentage points higher than the share of adults under 65 who cast a ballot by mail. Urban and suburban voters were considerably more likely than rural voters to say they cast their ballot by mail (50% of urban and suburban vs. 35% of rural voters). In contrast, rural voters were more likely to report voting in person on Election Day. A majority of Biden voters said they voted absentee or by mail in the 2020 election (58%). By contrast, about a third of Trump voters (32%) voted by mail. Roughly two-thirds of Trump voters (68%) said they voted in person, either on (38%) or before (30%) Election Day.  Reflecting these differences, Trump performed much better among voters who cast their ballots in person on Election Day (65% for Trump vs. 33% for Biden). These shares were reversed among absentee and mail-in voters: 65% of absentee voters said they voted for Biden, compared with 33% who voted for Trump. Preferences were more evenly divided among those who cast their ballots in person ahead of Election Day: 52% voted for Trump while 47% voted for Biden. The 2020 general election featured the highest rate of voter turnout in more than a century, with 66% of eligible adults casting a ballot for president. All members of the American Trends Panel who took the 2020 post-election survey – whether they voted or not – were asked which candidate they preferred in the race for president. Nonvoters – citizens for whom no record of turnout could be located or who told us they did not vote – preferred Joe Biden over Donald Trump by 15 percentage points, 50% to 35%, compared with Biden’s 4-point overall advantage among voters. Voters were nearly evenly divided on party affiliation, with 50% identifying or leaning Democratic and 48% identifying or leaning Republican, similar to the 51%-48% split in 2016. Nonvoters in 2020 were more closely divided on partisanship than they were in 2016. Among nonvoters in 2020, 46% were Democrats or leaned Democratic, while 41% were Republicans or leaned Republican. A majority of nonvoters in 2016 (55%) were Democrats or Democratic leaners, compared with about four-in-ten (41%) who were Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Despite notable changes in the demographics of the two candidates’ coalitions, the demographic composition of the electorate as a whole in 2020 did not differ much from that of 2016. Although turnout was strong, stark demographic differences between voters and nonvoters similar to those seen in past U.S. elections were present in 2020, a pattern familiar to political observers. Voters as a group were considerably older than nonvoters. Adults younger than 50 made up 45% of all voters but 68% of nonvoters – nearly identical to the pattern seen in 2016. But generational change in the electorate was quite apparent. Very few members of Gen Z (born 1997 and later) were eligible to vote in the 2016 electorate, and they made up just 1% of all voters that year. In 2020, they were 8% of the total, though their lower rate of turnout compared with older age cohorts is reflected in the fact that they were 15% of eligible nonvoters. At the other end of the generational spectrum, members of the Silent and Greatest generations (born 1945 and earlier) fell from 16% of all voters in 2016 to just 8% in 2020, but their turnout rates remained among the highest of all generations.  Turnout differences by race and ethnicity persisted as well. White non-Hispanic adults were 72% of voters in 2020 but just 55% of nonvoting citizens. Black Americans made up 11% of voters, but a slightly larger share (14%) of nonvoting citizens, and Hispanic adults were 10% of voters but 20% of nonvoting citizens. Asian Americans (a relatively small but fast-growing group in the U.S.) made up 4% of voters and an identical share of nonvoting citizens (note: nonvoters in this analysis do not include noncitizens). Some of the largest differences between voters and nonvoters are seen on education and income. College graduates made up 39% of all voters in 2020 (about the same as in 2016) but only 17% of nonvoters. Adults with a high school education or less were 29% of all voters but half of nonvoters.

,"""Who's paying for it?"": Fake Biden robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home","Help keep Salon independent A fake robocall purporting to be from President Joe Biden targeted New Hampshire voters, telling them to stay away from the polls in the state's presidential primary on Tuesday, per NBC News.  The New Hampshire attorney general was prompted to look into the matter after Kathy Sullivan, a top New Hampshire Democrat who runs a super PAC that urges Democrats in her state to write in Biden's name in the primary, filed a complaint. NBC reported that Sullivan's personal cell phone number appeared in the caller ID of those receiving the robocall.  “What a bunch of malarkey,” the phony message begins, citing an oft-used phrase by Biden. The message adds that “it’s important that you save your vote for the November election.” “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again. Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday,” the message says. ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement. ""These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely."" Sullivan in an interview said she began receiving calls on Sunday from people who had received the robocall.  “I said, ‘You got a call from Joe Biden, and he gave you my number?’” Sullivan said after one person, who was not a Biden supporter, informed her of the call. A volunteer for the super PAC who also received the call was able to tape it, sharing it with the write-in group's organizers who then passed it on to NBC. Though the source of the bogus call has not yet been identified, “It’s obviously somebody who wants to hurt Joe Biden,"" Sullivan said.  “I want them to be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible because this is an attack on democracy,” Sullivan added. “I’m not going to let it go. I want to know who’s paying for it? Who knew about it? Who benefits?” ",https://www.salon.com/2024/01/22/whos-paying-for-it-fake-biden-robocall-tells-new-hampshire-to-stay-home/,"Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to a crowd at a campaign stop at SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Jan. 20, 2024. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO 01/23/2024 05:00 AM EST  Donald Trump has a problem no matter what happens in New Hampshire on Tuesday night: There’s a whole swath of the Republican electorate and a good chunk of independents who appear firmly committed to not voting for him in November if he becomes the nominee. It’s an issue that became starkly apparent in polling ahead of the Iowa caucuses, when an NBC News/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of voters in that state found that fully 43 percent of Nikki Haley supporters said they would back President Joe Biden over Trump. And it’s a dynamic that has been on vivid display as the campaign shifted this week to New Hampshire. “I can’t vote for Trump. He’s a crook. He’s too corrupt,” said Scott Simeone, 64, an independent voter from Amherst, who backed Trump in 2016 and 2020. “I voted for him, and I didn’t realize he’s as corrupt as he is.” Primary elections can create intra-party divisions that, in the moment, seem impossible to heal. In 2008, a bloc of Hillary Clinton supporters started the PUMA (Party Unity My Ass) movement as a threat to never back Barack Obama after that bruising primary. Bernie Sanders’ supporters vowed to never support Clinton eight years later. In 2016, Trump himself faced pushback to his nomination all the way up to the convention floor.       But 2024 is different. Trump is not making his pitch to voters as a first time candidate. He is a known quantity who is being judged by the electorate not for the conduct of his current campaign so much as his time in office. And that, political veterans warn, makes it much harder for him to win back the people he’s alienated, including those once willing to vote Republican. The data supports the idea that there are problems ahead for the former president. Even before the Iowa survey, a New York Times/Siena College poll found that — including independents who say they lean toward one party over the other — Biden had slightly more support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91 percent) than Trump did among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (86 percent). Supporters listen to Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley speak at her last campaign event before the primary in Salem, New Hampshire. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO That’s far from a majority of Republicans preparing to pass on Trump in November. But in a close election, it could be enough to tip the scales for Democrats. At a minimum, it is a major liability for the GOP should the party, as expected, push Trump through as its nominee. “It would be a massively difficult hill to climb, without a doubt,” New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Haley endorser, told reporters of the party’s chances of winning New Hampshire in the general election with Trump on top of the ticket, when asked by POLITICO. “And he’s already proven that. He’s lost before and according to the polls he will lose even bigger this time.” Sean Van Anglen, a prominent and early Trump supporter in the state who now plans to vote for Haley on Tuesday, said if Trump becomes the nominee, he might have to blank that line on his November ballot. “I don’t think I can vote for Trump,” he said. “I vote in every election, I’ve never left a box blank. And I might have to this time.” 2024 ELECTIONS Nikki Haley made strides for women in politics. There’s just one problem: Trump BY NATALIE ALLISON | JANUARY 22, 2024 05:57 PM That sentiment was not uncommon among Republicans here this week, especially among voters who came out to see Haley, the former U.N. ambassador. “I liked him. But he just scares me now. Everybody that has ever worked for him is not any more,” said Lisa Tracy, of Salem. If it came down to Biden versus Trump, she said, “I would go with Biden.” These problems are not entirely unique to Republicans. Biden himself is grappling with a Democratic Party where a portion of voters have soured on him and are either leaning towards or threatening to vote for a third party candidate or stay home in November. “We need to keep showing that it can’t just be two parties that no one fully agrees with,” said Michelle Greene, a 34-year-old registered independent from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who saw Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), who is challenging the president in a primary, in Hampton on Sunday. Greene said it’s “definitely a concern” that a third-party candidate might siphon off votes from Biden in November. But she also wasn’t sure if she’d vote for Biden again, after backing him in 2020, in a head-to-head Biden-Trump rematch, adding that she “morally can’t support the lesser of two evils.”  How big a universe these groups of disaffected voters are could go a long way in determining the next president. But there are signs that, among independents at least, Trump is bleeding. In the New York Times/Siena College poll last month, Biden led Trump among all independents in the poll, 50 percent to 38 percent. At a brief press scrum on Saturday before Trump took the stage at a rally, the former president’s top adviser Chris LaCivita downplayed the numbers out of Iowa. A campaign spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But at events across the Granite state over the past week, surrogates for Trump have stressed the need for Republican reconciliation, depicting Biden’s presidency as an existential threat. Trump supporters cheer prior to his speech at a campaign event in Manchester on Jan. 20. There are signs that, among independents at least, Trump is bleeding. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO Sununu, for his part, said he was ready to back Trump should he end up being the party’s standard-bearer. While Biden is a “decent person,” Sununu said, “his team is so bad.” But what was notable about his argument was that it was delivered under duress. Sununu was speaking to a voter who had cornered him while he wiped snow from his car in a parking lot outside a Haley rally. That voter had wanted to know how he could possibly turn around and cast a vote for Trump after being so openly critical of his governance. Others who attended the event agreed. Curtis Thornbrugh, 81, an independent from Rindge, had voted for Barry Goldwater, Bob Dole, and both Bushes before casting his ballot for Obama twice and Biden in 2020 (he did not say how he voted in 2016). He was open to backing Haley in 2024 but couldn’t see himself supporting Trump. “I can’t find anything good to say and I try,” he explained. “He’s dangerous and the people around him are, too.” Forbes Farmer, 79, a fellow independent from Rindge, also went to view Haley in person at that event. He said he’d lean towards supporting her if she ran against Biden in November. Could he back Trump should he prevail? “No, never,” Farmer said. “I absolutely hate Trump.” Elena Schneider and Lisa Kashinsky contributed to this report.

,Joe Biden says 2024 U.S. election 'all about' whether America's democracy will survive,"U.S. President Joe Biden warned Friday that Donald Trump's efforts to retake the White House in 2024 pose a grave threat to the country, the day before the third anniversary of the violent riot at the U.S. Capitol by then-president Trump's supporters aiming to keep him in power.  Speaking near Valley Forge, Penn., where George Washington and the Continental Army spent a bleak winter nearly 250 years ago, Biden said that Jan. 6, 2021, marked a moment where ""we nearly lost America — lost it all."" He said the presidential race — a likely rematch with Trump, who is the far-and-away Republican front-runner — is ""all about"" whether American democracy will survive. The speech, the president's first political event of the election year, was intended to clarify the expected choice for voters this fall. Biden — who re-entered political life because he said he felt he was best capable of defeating Trump in 2020 — believes focusing on defending democracy to be central for persuading voters to reject Trump once again. ""We all know who Donald Trump is,"" Biden said. ""The question we have to answer is: Who are we?"" Biden laid out Trump's role in the Capitol attack, as a mob of the Republican's supporters overran the building while lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes that certified Democrat Biden's win. More than 100 police officers were bloodied, beaten and attacked by the rioters who overwhelmed authorities to break into the building. ""What's Trump done? He's called these insurrectionists 'patriots,'"" Biden said, ""and he promised to pardon them if he returns to office."" He chastised Trump for ""glorifying"" rather than condemning political violence. At least nine people who were at the Capitol that day died during or after the rioting, including several officers who died by suicide, a woman who was shot and killed by police as she tried to break into the House chamber and three other Trump supporters who authorities said suffered medical emergencies. Biden said that by ""trying to rewrite the facts of Jan. 6, Trump is trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election."" Trump, who faces 91 criminal charges stemming from his efforts to overturn his loss to Biden and three other felony cases, argues that Biden and top Democrats are themselves seeking to undermine democracy by using the legal system to thwart the campaign of his chief rival. The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether Trump could be kept off the ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. Speaking in Iowa Friday, Trump repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 election and his assertion that the Capitol rioters were patriotic. He called the long prison sentences handed down for some offenders — whom Trump calls ""hostages"" and were convicted of crimes like assaulting police officers on Jan. 6 or seditious conspiracy — ""one of the saddest things."" Biden, in his remarks, seized on Trump's grievances and his pledges to get retribution on his political enemies. ""Donald Trump's campaign is about him,"" Biden said. ""Not America. Not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future."" He added: ""There's no confusion about who Trump is or what he intends to do."" Before his remarks, Biden, joined by his wife Jill, participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Valley Forge National Arch, which honours the troops who camped there from December 1777 to June 1778. He also toured the home that served as Washington's headquarters. Biden invoked Washington's decision to resign his commission as the leader of the Continental Army after American independence was won — and the painting commemorating that moment that resides in the Capitol Rotunda — to cast Trump as unworthy of Washington's legacy. ""He could have held onto that power as long as he wanted,"" Biden said of Washington. ""But that wasn't the America he and the American troops of Valley Forge had fought for. In America, our leaders don't hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people — willingly."" Audience Relations, CBC

,The COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election,"An official website of the United States government       What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election? Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 cases and deaths on the change in county-level voting for Donald Trump between 2016 and 2020. To account for potential confounders, we include a large number of COVID-19-related controls as well as demographic and socioeconomic variables. Moreover, we instrument the numbers of cases and deaths with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories to sharpen our identification strategy. We find that COVID-19 cases negatively affected Trump’s vote share. The estimated effect appears strongest in urban counties, in states without stay-at-home orders, in swing states, and in states that Trump won in 2016. A simple counterfactual analysis suggests that Trump would likely have won re-election if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower. We also find some evidence that COVID-19 incidence had a positive effect on voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most consequential global events since World War II, affecting virtually every country in the world. By the end of November 2020, more than 60 million people had contracted the virus and over one and a half million had died. In response to the pandemic, governments restricted citizens’ movement to varying degrees through lockdown measures, with the objective of slowing the spread of the disease. The pandemic contributed to severe economic contractions in most countries, increasing unemployment and poverty around the world.1 In the USA, the COVID-19 pandemic struck during a presidential election year, shifting the political narrative and Trump’s re-election prospects. Prior to the pandemic, the US economy was performing well, and Trump, while extremely polarizing, enjoyed strong support among Republican voters.2 The virus changed the narrative and shaped the political campaign. As of the end of November 2020, the USA had suffered the largest numbers of cases (over 8 million) and deaths (over 220,000) in the world. Trump’s pandemic response, which contrasted with those of many leaders in other Western democracies, was repeatedly criticized by epidemiologists and scientists. In this paper, we explore the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election. We investigate whether Trump’s electoral support fell in localities hit harder by the pandemic. Guided by a pre-analysis plan (PAP), which reduces concerns about data mining, we constructed a data set at the county-level, with the difference in vote share for Trump between the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections as our dependent variable.3 Our main independent variable is COVID-19 cases, which we gather from the data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. In our estimates, we control for social distancing and four occupational measures: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. In addition, we account for demographic and socioeconomic variables and for changes in unemployment between August 2019 and August 2020. In placebo tests, we show that COVID-19 incidence is uncorrelated with changes in Republican candidates vote share in previous elections, e.g., votes for Trump in 2016 compared with votes for Romney in 2012. In an attempt to sharpen our identification strategy, we instrument COVID-19 cases with the share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. We show that counties with a larger share of workers employed in meat-processing factories experienced a significantly larger number of cases than counties with a smaller share of workers employed in meat-processing factories. Our two-stage least squares estimates also control for the share of manufacturing workers and the share of food manufacturing workers in each county as well as for counties’ vulnerability to Trump’s trade policies in an effort to validate the exclusion restriction. Our results indicate that COVID-19 cases had a significant negative effect on the Trump vote share in the 2020 presidential election (in comparison to 2016). This finding holds in both the reduced form analysis and the instrumental variable analysis. We also find potentially important heterogeneity in the effect of COVID-19. In particular, the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a formal stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential election, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that the change in the unemployment rate is related to electoral support for Trump. There is some evidence that COVID-19 cases affect voters’ mobilization, measured as the number of votes cast in 2020 compared to 2016. These effects not only are significant and robust to many robustness checks but they are also quite sizable. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if the number of COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin—likely resulting in his re-election. Our paper is related to several streams of the literature on political behavior and political economy.4 First, our paper speaks to the literature on retrospective voting, which examines how citizens evaluate and vote based on their perceptions of the incumbent’s performance (Fiorina 1981; Ferejohn 1986; Persson et al. 1997; Fearon 1999; Canes-Wrone et al. 2001; Ashworth 2012). Our findings indicate that voters assess the competence of political leaders in the case of a pandemic and hold them accountable for rising numbers of cases and deaths. This is consistent with evidence in Herrera et al. (2020), who find in a sample of 35 countries that approval of incumbent politicians falls as COVID-19 cases grow, as well as Gutierrez et al. (2020), who find that voters punished the incumbent government following the H1N1 epidemic in Mexico. Second, our paper is related to a literature that links shocks such as natural disasters to political behavior (Abney and Hill 1966; Chen 2012; Malhotra and Kuo 2008; Bechtel and Hainmueller 2011). The logic of this literature is similar to that of retrospective voting. Rational voters reward incumbents not only for delivering a positive economic performance in good times but also for organizing prompt rescue and relief programs in bad times, such as in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Our findings indicate that incumbent governments are punished electorally for failing to provide effective mitigation and relief, even if the primary shock (in this case, a virus) is not directly attributable to them. Third, our paper speaks to the literature on the effect of personally experiencing shocks (e.g., crises and wars) on political and social attitudes (Lau et al. 1978; Kinder and Kiewiet 1981; Erikson and Stoker 2001; Mo and Conn 2018). Our findings are consistent with studies showing that negative economic shocks increase support for government intervention in the economy and redistributive policies as well as people’s beliefs about the relative importance of luck versus effort (Margalit 2013; Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014). These changes in voters’ preferences and beliefs are consistent with increasing support for a Democratic candidate over an incumbent Republican president in the midst of a pandemic. Finally, our paper also relates to a growing literature on the pandemic. For instance, Allcott et al. (2020) rely on smartphone data and provide evidence that areas with more Republicans engaged in less social distancing. Baccini and Brodeur (2020) show that Democratic governors and governors without a term limit are significantly faster (and more likely) to adopt stay-at-home orders than Republican governors and governors with a term limit. Warshaw et al. (2020) demonstrate that states and local areas with relatively more COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support Republican House and Senate candidates. Other papers have explored related issues, such as policy responses and social distancing, in other countries such China and Italy (Qiu et al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021; Milani 2021). News of a novel coronavirus made global headlines beginning in January 2020. On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a coronavirus-type pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began screening at three major US airports on January 20, and the first US coronavirus case was confirmed the following day. On January 23, China made the unprecedented move of quarantining Wuhan, a city of 11 million people. The white House announced on January 31 a travel ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to China within the past 14 days. The first US death from the disease occurred on February 29 in Washington State.5 The WHO declared a pandemic on March 11. That same day the US National Basketball Association suspended all games, and the actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for the virus in Australia. Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, unlocking up to $50 billion dollars in federal funding to combat the spread of the disease, the same day on which several states announced school closures. On March 19, California became the first state to issue a “stay-at-home” order, with exceptions for work and shopping for essential needs. On March 26, Trump signed into law the CARES Act, which provided $2 trillion in aid to businesses, hospitals, and local governments. While no country was unaffected, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the USA particularly hard. The US COVID-19 death toll passed the grim mark of 100,000 on May 28; by September 22, 200,000 American lives had been lost. Measured on a per capita basis, only Brazil, Spain, and Mexico have recorded higher death rates among large countries.6 Along with lost lives, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in the USA exerted a profound economic impact. Increasing numbers of cases caused changes in consumer behavior, with large drops in consumption of services (Baker et al. 2020; Chetty et al. 2020) leading to an unprecedented increase in unemployment (Chetty et al. 2020; Coibion et al. 2020). The economic downturn coincided with changing political attitudes about the role of government, with Rees-Jones et al. (2020a) finding deaths and infections associated with increased support for expanding the US safety net. In sharp contrast to most world leaders and to his opponent Joe Biden, Trump sought to downplay the threat of the virus, with limited political success. He began this tactic early in the crisis, and never veered from it. On February 10, Trump claimed, “a lot of people think that [coronavirus] goes away in April with the heat...” On February 26, as US cases began to appear, he said, “when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.” Again, on April 3, he remarked, “It is going to go away. It is going away.” He continued making similar comments throughout the summer, and in his first remarks after contracting the virus himself in October, he declared, “It’s going to disappear. It is disappearing.”7 The tactic did little to help his standing with the electorate. According to Gallup, Trump’s approval rating fell from a 2020 high of 49% on March 22 to 38% on June 30.8 Polls showed nearly 60% of Americans disapproved of Trump’s response to the pandemic, with very little variation in the 5 months leading up to the election.9 There are several reasons to believe that the pandemic and the Trump administration’s response were detrimental to Trump’s reelection prospects. The strong disapproval of the president’s handling of the virus suggests that a majority of the public blamed the administration for its failure to curtail its spread. Most importantly, voters likely associate rising local cases and deaths with an increasing threat to the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones. In this context, we might expect that the greater the local exposure to risk, the more likely voters are to punish the president by voting for the challenger. Another channel through which COVID-19 may have lead to diminished Trump support is economic. Despite a big rebound in economic growth in the third quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate remains well above the historical average. Ominously, rising case numbers in the lead-up to the election portended another wave of hospitalizations and deaths—and the prospect of more localized lockdowns, business closures, and a double-dip recession. Both retrospective and prospective voting frameworks suggest that voters are likely to hold the president accountable for the toll of the virus. For these reasons, we examine whether more severe local outbreaks are associated with weaker support for Trump in 2020, compared to the 2016 presidential election. There is, however, a counter-argument to be made. A possible interpretation of Trump’s strategy in responding to the pandemic is that it was in line with the preferences of his core constituents. Survey data reveal a striking difference in attitudes toward the pandemic between Democratic and Republican voters. According to Gallup, only 25% of Republican respondents are “worried about getting the coronavirus,” whereas this percentage climbs to almost 80% among Democratic respondents.10 Similarly, about 60% of Republican respondents are “ready to return to normal activities right now,” whereas a mere 3% of Democratic respondents are ready to resume a normal lifestyle. We see similar differences for questions related to practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding large crowds. While ideology influences attitudes toward the pandemic in other countries as well, the differences between Democratic and Republican voters in the USA are uniquely large. In short, given the polarization of US politics, voters seem to be experiencing the very same event in very different ways based on their partisan identities. If this is the case, even a global pandemic responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths may not meaningfully reduce support for Trump, especially among his base. We describe all the data that we use in our analysis below. Our analysis relies on known COVID-19 cases and deaths, recorded at the county-level. We use the COVID-19 incidence data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The data and data sources at the state and county levels can be accessed here: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19. The cumulative totals of COVID-19 cases and deaths correspond to October 22, 2020. In our sample, the mean for the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 is 247 (std. dev. 157), while the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 is 53 (std. dev. 56). Figure 1 and Appendix Fig. 4 illustrate the distribution of cases and deaths in the USA, respectively. Cumulative Number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 as of October 22, 2020 Cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. This figure illustrates the the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 as of October 22, 2020 We also gather data on the following COVID-19 policies: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for individuals arriving from another state. Data on policy duration are drawn from Raifman et al. (2020). See our discussion paper for more details about these policies (Baccini et al. 2020). We draw social distancing data from Google’s COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports. This data set captures visits to a location relative to a baseline day using data from users who have enabled “location history” in their Google account. The baseline day is the median value for the 5-week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020. We rely on workplace as the location of interest as of April 1, 2020, i.e., the midpoint of the first COVID-19 wave. We also rely on mobility change as of August 1st as a robustness check, i.e., the midpoint of the second wave.11 We merge variables capturing COVID-19 incidence by county with data on county-level election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections.12 We compute the difference of vote shares of Trump between the 2020 and 2016 US presidential elections. Specifically, we compute shares dividing the total number of votes for Trump by the total number of votes in each county. Table 1 provides summary statistics, and Fig. 2 illustrates changes in voting share from 2016 to 2020. The map shows that Trump’s support fell in parts of the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt in 2020 compared with the 2016 presidential election.13 Descriptive statistics Authors’ calculations. Election results from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. Electoral outcomes are not weighted (by the number of registered voters). Changes in Trump voting (2020–2016) and Trump voting (2020) are in percentages. Cumulative COVID-19 cases, cases per 10,000 people, deaths, and deaths per 100,000 people are the cumulative totals corresponding to October 22, 2020. Share of employment in meat-processing factories is computed using data from the County Business Patterns. Monthly unemployment data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics Changes in share of votes for Donald Trump from 2016 to 2020. This figure illustrates the differential in vote shares for Trump in 2020 and 2016  We rely on the County Business Patterns (CBP) to compute the share of employment in meat-processing factories. Of note, there are jobs in this industry for about 52% of counties. The CBP provides annual data for establishments with paid employees within the USA. This data set provides annual employment data at the county-level for the week of March 12 and annual payroll data. Note that the CBP does not include employment for most establishments with government employees and the following NAICS industries: crop and animal production; rail transportation; Postal Service; pension, health, welfare, and vacation funds; trusts, estates, and agency accounts; office of notaries; private households; and public administration. See https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/about.html for more details. Last, we get monthly unemployment rates at the county-level from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Local Area Unemployment Statistics. In our sample, the mean change in the unemployment rate from August 2019 to August 2020 was an increase of 2.87.14 We rely on four occupational indexes as control variables: (1) exposure to disease or infection, (2) physical proximity, (3) essential worker designation, and (4) remote work. The first three indexes were built in Beland et al. (2020), while the remote work index comes from Dingel and Neiman (2020). These indexes serve as covariates in our analysis since they have been shown to be related to the severity of job losses in the USA and could be related to voting behavior and COVID-19 incidence. In this section, we describe the empirical strategy that was pre-specified in a PAP. We first present our OLS model and provide evidence that our model is more appropriate than a naïve model relating COVID-19 incidence and Trump vote share. We then describe the IV specification, in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence with the share of employment in meat-processing plants. As stated in our PAP, we first rely on the following model: where Yc is the differential in Trump’s vote share in 2020 and 2016 for county c. COVIDIncidencec is the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants as of October 22, 2020.15 We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. We include in the model Xc, which is a vector of county-level variables. We include the following demographic and socioeconomic variables: population, share of female population, share of foreign-born population, share of population with a college degree, share of non-Hispanic Black population, share of non-Hispanic white population, share of population by age group (9 dummies), social mobility index, and four occupational indexes. Moreover, we compute employment changes due to the pandemic at the county-level by taking the unemployment rate as of September 2020 minus the unemployment rate as of September 2019.16 The inclusion of these variables is key to our identification assumption that no omitted variables are related to COVID-19 incidence and the change in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election. Finally, 𝜃s represents state fixed effects. This set of fixed effects allows us to further control for county-level characteristics that are common to counties within the same state. Our estimation is thus at the county-level and we effectively test whether counties with relatively more COVID-19 cases or deaths differentially voted for the Trump in 2020 compared with the previous presidential election. We use this model instead of a model relating COVID-19 incidence to vote share in 2020 alone to better capture trends in voting behavior. In other words, we compare how voting behavior changed pre- and post-COVID-19 rather than simply analyzing voting behavior post-COVID-19. We believe this is crucial in this context given the increasing political polarization in the USA. Moreover, we think that the inclusion of state fixed effects and controlling for social distancing and a large set of demographic variables helps account for differential (changes in) behavior and preferences across counties. This is also crucial because a growing literature has shown, for instance, that individuals identifying as Republicans are less likely to comply with social distancing orders than those identifying as Democrats (e.g., Allcott et al. 2020; Gollwitzer et al.2020). We complement the reduced form analysis with an instrumental variable approach. The concern we attempt to address is that COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 deaths do not occur at random, but rather they correlate with individuals’ behavior, which may be different between those who vote for the Democratic Party and those who vote for the Republican Party. For instance, it may be that voters living in “red” (i.e., Republican-leaning) counties are less likely to observe social distancing or to wear masks. If this is the case, this type of behavior would be likely to increase the number of COVID-19 cases (and in turn COVID-19 deaths) and we would observe a larger share of votes for Trump than for Biden in the same counties. While we control for social distancing in the previous analysis, we may have missed some other confounders in our analysis. To attempt to achieve exogenous variation of COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county-level, we instrument COVID-19 cases and deaths with the share of employment in meat-processing factories in each county. More specifically, we use the average number of workers in the NAICS industry code 3116, “Animal Slaughtering and Processing,” in each county between 2012 and 2015, i.e., before Trump’s presidency. We divide this number by the average number of total workers in each country during the same time frame, i.e., 2012–2015. Data come from the CBP and measure raw employment. The rationale for the instrument is that there is evidence of meat-processing plants becoming COVID-19 hotbeds due to their cold, humid environment and difficulties with workplace physical distancing.17 According to a CDC report on July 10, among 23 states reporting COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and poultry facilities, 16,233 cases in 239 facilities occurred, including 86 (0.5%) COVID-19-related deaths.18 Based on cases reported by Johns Hopkins University, as of May 6, counties containing or within 15 miles of one or more meatpacking plants reported 373 COVID-19 cases per 10,000 residents.19 That is roughly double the US average of 199 cases per 100,000 in all counties with reported cases.20 The severity of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in meat-processing facilities prompted research on how to control the spread of the virus in these plants.21 Armed with this instrument, we estimate: where MEATc is the share of workers in meat-processing plants. We run a first stage in which we regress this variable on the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants or deaths per 100,000 inhabitants at the county level, including all controls and state fixed effects as in Eq. 1. Then we plug in the predicted values of this first stage and estimate the second stage of the 2SLS. For our instrument to be valid two conditions have to hold. First, our instrument has to be a strong predictor of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories since the beginning of the pandemic for the (1) top 1% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with the highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories. This figure illustrates the cumulative number of number of COVID-19 cases and the share of employment in meat-processing factories for the (1) top 1% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (2) top 5% of counties with highest share of employment in meat-processing factories, (3) counties with at least one job in meat-processing factories, and (4) counties without any jobs in meat-processing factories. Employment data is from the County Business Patterns This figure provides direct evidence that counties with a higher share of employment in meat-processing factories had a higher incidence of COVID-19 during the entire pandemic. COVID-19 case (and death) incidence is much larger for counties with a relatively high share of employment in meat-processing factories and much smaller for counties with no employment or positive employment share. This result suggests our first stage is strong and that the relationship between the share of employment in meat-processing factories and COVID-19 incidence is non-linear. Note also that the raw correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument is 0.3 and 0.1, respectively. The correlation between COVID-19 cases and deaths and our instrument conditional on controls and state fixed effect is much higher, i.e., above 0.5 for cases and 0.3 for deaths. Second, the identifying variance is the industrial composition of each county, specifically the presence of meat-processing factories. In order for our instrument to allow a causal interpretation, employment in meat-processing factories must only affect the change in voting behavior from 2016 to 2020 through its effect on COVID-19 cases and deaths, i.e., the exogeneity assumption. While there is no test to assess the validity of this assumption, we discuss other possible channels through which our instrument can affect the outcome variable and explain how we account for these channels. While we control for a host of variables that could potentially affect the exclusion restriction, we discuss here two main possible violations of the exogeneity assumption. First, we control for the share of manufacturing employment. We do so because it may be that counties with a large share of workers in manufacturing voted against Trump in 2020 due to job losses for which he was now held accountable as the incumbent president. It may also be that trade unions were more actively campaigning against Trump in 2020 than they were in 2016, since he was the incumbent Republican president. In an effort to isolate the effect of our instrument on COVID-19 cases, we also include the share of workers in food manufacturing, i.e., NAICS industry code 311, to which “Animal Slaughtering and Processing” belongs. Including this variable implies that every possible violation of the exclusion restriction has to be specific to the meat-processing industry. In the same spirit, we are concern that Trump policies—both those related and those unrelated to trade—did not specifically affect meat packaging industry. We thus include the China trade shock variable, which captures the vulnerability of US manufacturing counties to foreign competition especially from China.22Autor et al. (2020) show that the China trade shock increased Trump’s vote in 2016 and, in the same vein, it could have decreased his electoral support in 2020 as the incumbent president. Second, it may be that Trump’s trade policies have negatively affected meat sales, and in turn this could have led to a loss of support among workers in this industry and in surrounding communities. Kim and Margalit (2021) provide evidence of that. For addressing this concern, we include variables capturing the potential impact of Chinese tariffs and US tariffs on the workforce in each county.23 Note also that the correlation between our instrument and the share of manufacturing employment and share of employment in food manufacturing is 0.3 and 0.4 respectively, whereas the correlation between our instrument and the other controls is never higher than 0.1.24 In Appendix Table 8, we provide empirical evidence that COVID-19 incidence is significantly related to votes for Trump in 2016 and 2020. We then provide evidence that COVID-19 incidence in our models is not successfully predicting changes in voting behavior for previous presidential elections. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). In panel A (B), the dependent variable is the vote share for Trump in the 2020 (2016) presidential election, whereas the dependent variable in panel C is the change in votes for Trump from 2012 to 2016. Columns 1 and 4 include only state fixed effects and our demographic controls, while columns 2 and 3 sequentially add socioeconomic controls and our social distancing indicator. Placebo analysis using previous presidential elections Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Each point estimate is from a different regression. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2020 (OLS). In panel B, the dependent variable is the vote share for the Republican Party in 2016 (OLS). In panel C, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (OLS). In panel D, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2016 and 2012 (2SLS). In panel E, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2012 and 2008 (2SLS). In panel F, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for the Republican Party in 2008 and 2004 (2SLS). The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 1–3) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (columns 4–6). All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes The estimates in panels A and B are positive and significant, suggesting that counties with more Trump’s supporters had larger numbers of COVID-19 cases. The fact that both estimates are positive and significant for both the 2016 and the 2020 presidential elections suggest that this model is misspecified and that a naïve estimation would conclude that COVID-19 incidence helped Trump during the 2020 presidential election.25 In contrast, the estimates are imprecisely estimated and statistically insignificant in all columns in panel C, suggesting that using the differential in voting is more appropriate than using the vote share for the current elections. We also provide placebo evidence that our IV method leads to null findings for previous presidential elections. The estimates are presented in panels D, E, and F. The dependent variables are respectively the differential in vote share for the Republican Party for the elections in 2016 and 2012 (panel D), in 2012 and 2008 (panel E), and in 2008 and 2004 (panel F). The point estimates for COVID-19 cases are all statistically insignificant and much smaller than our 2SLS estimates for 2016–2020. These results provide evidence that our empirical models are properly specified. In this section, we estimate the effect of COVID-19 incidence on voting behavior using OLS and 2SLS. We focus on COVID-19 cases in the main analysis. We note again that our analysis and choice of control variables were fully detailed in our pre-analysis plan. Table 2 contains OLS estimates of Eq. 1 (columns 1–3). The sample size is 2689 observations (i.e., counties).26 The dependent variable is the differential in vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and 2016. A positive value indicates that Trump received more votes in 2020 than in 2016. We report standard errors clustered at the state-level. The variables of interest are the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The impact of COVID-19 cases: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county (n = 2, 689). Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019 What clearly emerges is that COVID-19 cases are negatively related to votes for Trump during the 2020 presidential election in comparison to the 2016 election. In column 1, we include state fixed effects and our set of demographic and socioeconomic controls. We find that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 0.12 percentage points on average. The point estimate is statistically significant at about the 10% level. In column 2, we add to the model our indicator of social distancing, i.e., time spent at workplaces in April 2020. Column 3 is our most extensive model specification. We saturate our model with all the previous controls and state fixed effects. In addition, we add to the model the unemployment change from before to during COVID-19. The magnitude of the estimates and statistical significance remain the same. In column 4, we add to the model a quadratic term of COVID-19 cases. The quadratic term of COVID-19 cases is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level, but very small in magnitude (6.10e-08). In contrast, the magnitude and sign of the coefficient of our variable of interest, cumulative COVID-19 cases per 10,000, remain the same. This result suggests that the negative effect of additional COVID-19 cases on Trump’s 2020 vote share becomes slightly smaller as the number of cases increases. Of note, the coefficient of unemployment change (August 2019 to August 2020) is small and statistically insignificant.27 Our results thus suggest that job losses during the pandemic are not significantly related to voting behavior and that increases in the unemployment rate does not seem to be a major factor behind the negative effect of COVID-19 on the share of votes for Trump. A possible explanation is that job losses are triggered by policies, e.g., lockdowns, implemented by the states, which Trump opposed or at the very least for which Trump cannot be held directly responsible. The coefficients for some of the other control variables are worth discussing (not shown for space consideration). We find that the share of women is strongly negatively correlated with the change in vote share for Trump. Similarly, Trump seems to have lost vote share in counties with a high share of adults aged 25–54. Our OLS results provide suggestive evidence that the pandemic affected the 2020 presidential election. The main concern with our OLS estimates is that omitted variables could be related to both COVID-19 incidence and differential voting behavior in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. We now turn to our instrumental variable strategy. In Table 2 (columns 5–7), we present the first stage (panel A) and the two-stage estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in the first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. We control for our usual set of fixed effects and control variables. As shown in Fig. 3, we find that the share of employment in meat-processing factories is strongly positively correlated with COVID-19 incidence. The coefficient is always significant and the F-statistics indicate no concern of a weak instrument. Our second-stage estimates are presented in the bottom panel (columns 4–6). We find that counties with more COVID-19 cases substantially decreased their vote share for Trump in 2020. The 2SLS estimates are larger than the OLS estimates and suggest that a county with 100 more COVID cases per 10,000 people (as compared to others in the same state) reduced its Trump vote share from 2016 to 2020 by an additional 1.2 percentage point on average.28 The point estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level and robust to the inclusion of our large set of controls and the share of manufacturing employment as well as the share of employment in food manufacturing. So far, our analysis has underscored an important finding: the COVID-19 pandemic costs Trump votes. But is this effect large enough to have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election? To answer this question, we conduct a simple counterfactual exercise to determine the magnitude of the effect by exploring how the composition of votes in a number of closely contested states would have differed if there had been fewer COVID-19 cases. The computation of the counterfactual is based on the coefficient estimate in column 1 of Table 2. For each county, we compute the fraction of total votes that Trump would have received if the number of COVID-19 cases had been X% smaller as − 0.0012 ×COVIDc × X% – i.e., the point estimate of the effect of COVIDc on Trump’s vote share from the OLS estimates, the size of each county’s measured COVID-19 cases, and the scaling factor X%. We next multiply this product by the number of total votes in a county to calculate the number of additional votes that Trump would have received in the counterfactual scenario. We then aggregate these county-level votes into state totals. To allow for the margin of error in our counterfactual calculations, we use the lower and upper bounds of our estimate (i.e., 0.0012), using the 90% confidence interval. We report these bounds in parenthesis. Table 3 presents the results of this counterfactual analysis. Column 1 shows the actual vote margin in favor of Biden in the 2020 election for a set of closely contested states. The three subsequent columns show counterfactual outcomes had COVID-19 cases been 5% or 10% or 20% fewer. Since we find that the COVID incidence decreased Trump’s vote share, the counterfactual analyses for fewer COVID-19 cases correspondingly increase Trump’s counterfactual vote totals. The results in Table 3 show that, ceteris paribus, Trump would have won Michigan in a counterfactual scenario with 20% fewer cases. Trump would have won Pennsylvania with 10% fewer COVID-19 cases. He would have won Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin, with 5% fewer COVID-19 cases. Under this last counterfactual, Trump would have been reelected. Even if we consider the lower bound calculations, which are very conservative, Trump would have kept the presidency with 21% fewer cases. Counterfactual outcomes in closely contested states won by Biden The computation of the counterfactual is based on the estimate from the OLS model. An increase in per COVID-19 cases reduces Trump’s share of vote by 0.0012 percentage points (see column 3 in Table 2). The actual outcome in column 2 reports the margin in favor of Biden in each state. Negative values indicate that Biden won the state in 2020. The reported values in columns 3 and 4 are estimated margins in favor of Trump in the counterfactual scenario of fewer COVID-19 cases. The numbers in parentheses are the lower and upper bound on these calculations, using the 90% confidence intervals of our OLS estimate. A positive value in columns 3 or 4 larger than the negative value in column 2 implies that Trump would have won the state We investigate heterogeneous effects of COVID-19 on voting in Table 4. In columns 1 and 2, we first investigate whether the effect of COVID-19 incidence is larger/smaller for states that have implemented a stay-at-home order than for states that did not implement such a policy during the pandemic. Data on stay-at-home order comes from Raifman et al. (2020) and only include directives/orders for the entire state, i.e., did not include guidance or recommendations. Of note, all states without a stay-at-home order are states that Trump won in 2016. Our 2SLS estimates suggest that COVID-19 had a larger effect in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order during the pandemic. This result seems to suggest that if Trump had taken the pandemic more seriously and had placed more emphasis on health and safety issues, he would have lost less electorally and he would have had higher chances to get re-elected. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by state and county characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (Eq. 2). In columns 1 and 2, we restrict the sample to counties in states that implemented a stay-at-home order during the pandemic and counties in states that did not implement a stay-at-home order, respectively. In columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the difference in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016 for states that Trump and Clinton won, respectively. Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. The variables of interest are the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (panel A) and COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 (panel B), respectively. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing Columns 3 and 4, we document the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016, for Trump’s and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s states separately. We define states as Trump’s or Clinton’s using the electoral votes for the 2016 US presidential election.29 We find that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by those states that he won in the 2016 presidential election. The magnitude of the coefficient is about 50% larger than the magnitude of the coefficient in the entire sample.30 In contrast, the coefficient of COVID-19 cases is small, positive, and not significant in those states that Clinton won in the 2016 presidential election (column 2).31 Columns 5 and 6 restrict the sample to swing and non-swing states.32 Our results indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is almost twice as large in swing states as it is in non-swing states. Columns 7 and 8 restrict the sample to urban and rural counties, respectively. We define a county as “urban” (“rural”) if over (below) 50% of its population was living in an urban area in 2010 (US Census). Our results show that urban counties drive the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote. Indeed, the effect is negative and significant in the urban sample, whereas it is smaller and statistically insignificant in rural counties. In Table 5, we investigate heterogeneity by county demographic characteristics. We find that negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger for countries below the median percentage of residents aged 65 than for counties above the median percentage of residents aged 65. Our estimates also indicate that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases is stronger in more racially diverse counties (i.e., those with white population shares below the median). Furthermore, our findings show that the negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote is driven by less educated counties (i.e., those with a below-median share of residents with college degrees), which may help explain Biden’s victory in the Rust Belt. The impacts of COVID-19 cases (2SLS): heterogeneity analyses by demographic characteristics Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for the Republican Party in 2020 and 2016. We report the second stage estimates of our 2SLS (2). We restrict the sample to counties: below (column 1) and above (column 2) the median percentage of residents aged 65; below (column 3) and above (column 4) the median percentage of white (non Hispanic) residents; and below (column 5) and above (column 6) the median percentage of residents who attended college. The variable of interest is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000. All specifications shown include state FEs, and demographic, social distancing, socioeconomic, and IV controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing  We now check whether our results are robust to the use of COVID-19 deaths instead of cases. Table 6 shows our estimates. We do not find any evidence that COVID-19 deaths are related to changes in voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 presidential election with our OLS model. The estimates are all statistically insignificant. For our 2SLS estimates, our first stage is weaker than for cases, with F-statistics ranging from 2 in the less parsimonious model to 6 in our model with the full set of controls. The 2SLS estimates are all negative and of similar magnitude as our 2SLS estimates for cases, but more imprecise with only the estimate in column 6 being statistically significant at conventional levels. The impacts of COVID-19 deaths: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–4 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 5–7 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 5–7). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in vote for Trump in 2020 and 2016. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age groups. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing The fact that our 2SLS estimates are of about the same magnitude for cases and deaths suggests that our conclusions are similar when using deaths instead of cases. Nonetheless, two differences are worth mentioning. First, our instrumental variable is only weakly related to COVID-19 deaths.33 The probability that a COVID-19 infection results in death rises dramatically with age, and we expect that this and other factors such as healthcare coverage may contribute to the divergence in estimated effects. Second, it is plausible that voters are less aware or less likely to know someone who has died of COVID-19 than to know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.  One of the defining outcomes of the 2020 presidential election was the record-high turnout. Both presidential candidates would had won any previous elections, given their number of votes at the national-level. We use differences in total votes between the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections as a rough proxy of turnout. We run the same model specification as in Eqs. 1 and 2. We show the results in Table 7. The impact of COVID-19 cases on total votes: OLS and 2SLS estimates Election data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of US Presidential Elections. An observation is a county. Robust standard errors are in parentheses, adjusted for clustering by state. We present OLS estimates in columns 1–3 of specification (1). We present the first stage (panel A) and the 2SLS estimates (panel B) of specification (2) in columns 4–6 in which we instrument COVID-19 incidence in a first stage by the share of employment in meat-processing factories. In panel A, the dependent variable is the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 (columns 4–6). In panel B, the dependent variable is the differential in total votes from 2016 to 2020. All specifications shown include state FEs and demographic and socioeconomic controls. Demographic controls include population, female population share, foreign-born population, non-Hispanic Black population, non-Hispanic white population, and the share of the population by age group. Socioeconomic controls include share of the population with a college degree and four occupational indexes. The unemployment change variable is the unemployment rate in September 2020 minus the unemployment rate in September 2019. IV controls include variables for the share of employment in manufacturing and in food manufacturing We find no evidence that COVID-19 cases affected voters’ mobilization in the OLS estimates.34 On the contrary, there is some evidence that the incidence of COVID-19 boosts turnout in the 2SLS. These conflicting results on the effect of the pandemic on mobilization are also found in previous studies that explore this topic in different electoral contexts (Giommoni and Loumeau 2020; Fernández-Navia et al. 2020).35  We provide many robustness checks for our 2SLS results in Baccini et al. (2020). For instance, we add to the models well-known predictors of voting behavior or COVID-19 incidence. We show that our results are robust to controlling for the China shock variable (Autor et al. (2020)) and two variables capturing Chinese tariffs and protection by US tariffs at the county-level from Kim and Margalit (2021). The rationale for including these variables has been explained in the previous section. We also show that our estimates are robust to the inclusion of weather controls such as precipitation and air pollution (i.e., PM2.5 and precipitation for the first months of the pandemic),36 the share of employment in nursing care facilities,37 county-to-county (in and out) migration, and the duration (in days) of the following statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions: stay-at-home orders, mandatory face mask policies, day care closures, freezes on evictions, and mandated quarantine for out-of-state individuals.38 Overall, the inclusion of one or all of these control variables has no effect on the magnitude and significance of our 2SLS estimates. We also check whether our OLS and 2SLS point estimates vary if we change the date for the moment in which we calculate the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. As stated in our pre-analysis plan, we rely on October 22nd for our main analysis. In a set of robustness checks, we instead rely on July 1st, August 1st, September 1st, and August 1st. The estimates for the OLS are all larger and more significant than for our baseline, i.e., cases as of October 22nd, suggesting that we are very conservative in estimating the relationship between COVID-19 cases and the differential in votes for Trump. For the 2SLS, the point estimates all range from − 0.011 to − 0.013 and are statistically significant at the 1% level. Similarly, changing the start period to April or May, i.e., excluding cases that occurred early on in the pandemic, has no impact on our conclusions. Last, we show that our conclusions are robust to using a different geographical level for the analysis. In Baccini et al. (2020), we replicate our main analysis using commuting zones as our unit of analysis. Commuting zones are significantly larger than counties, which provides the advantage that the distribution of employment in the meat-processing industry is less limited geographically, since many commuting zones have at least one meat-processing factory.39 This paper explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 2020 US presidential election using both a reduced form and IV approach. Our key finding is that COVID-19 cases decreased electoral support for Trump. A simple counterfactual exercise shows that, ceteris paribus, if COVID-19 cases had been 5 percent lower, Trump would have been reelected. We find that the negative impact of COVID-19 incidence on Trump’s support is stronger (1) in states without a stay-at-home order, (2) in states that Trump won in the 2016 presidential elections, (3) in swing states, and (4) in urban counties. We find no evidence that worsening economic conditions reduced electoral support for Trump. The 2SLS estimates show evidence that COVID-19 cases affect positively voters’ mobilization, helping Biden win the presidency. At least two explanations are consistent with these findings. First, voters may have electorally sanctioned Trump for how he handled the pandemic, which was at odds with most major countries, and widely criticized. This explanation is consistent with a retrospective voting approach (Fiorina 1981; Fearon 1999; Norpoth 2001), in which voters sanction incumbents for their handling of negative shocks. Second, some voters may have switched from Trump to Biden due to changes in preferences triggered by the pandemic and the recession. In particular, a severe public health threat and major economic losses may have shifted preferences in favor of an expansion of the social safety net, including healthcare and unemployment insurance programs (Rees-Jones et al. 2020b). Since the Democratic Party is more likely to champion these policies, Biden benefited from this switch in voters’ preferences. This explanation is in line with studies claiming that political preferences are shaped by personal experience. If it is true that these changes in preferences are long lasting (Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014), the Democratic Party may be able to capitalize electorally in future elections. Our empirical analysis is unable to tease out which of these two channels is operative; this remains an important task for future research. Future studies should also explore how turnout, which was quite high for the 2020 presidential election but for which granular data is not yet available, influenced the results reported in this paper. Finally, when individual-level survey data become available, it will be important to explore how voter heterogeneity in race, age, and other characteristics conditions voters’ responses to the pandemic.

We thank Sung Eun Kim and Yotam Margalit for sharing their data on the China trade war with us. We also thank Sean Nossek, Paul-Antoine Seitz, and Taylow Wright for excellent research assistance. For the empirical analysis, we follow the specifications and test the hypotheses detailed in our pre-analysis plan (PAP). Our PAP was archived on October 30, 2020, at https://osf.io/xvuzp/, 4 days prior to the Presidential Elections. We relied on a PAP to minimize issues of specification searching and p-hacking. Another advantage of relying on a PAP is that it allowed us to think carefully about the analyses to be conducted prior to the outcome of the Presidential Elections. This is potentially important given the growing concerns that social science researchers may be politically biased. We aimed to follow the PAP to the greatest extent possible, but made some modifications following suggestions from other researchers and reviewers, and gaining access to the voting data. We try to be as transparent as possible and list all the modifications made to the pre-analysis plan and supplementary analyses not included in the PAP in Baccini et al. (2020).

(2020) for a review of studies using cellphone data to measure mobility during the pandemic. 12Data can be purchased from https://uselectionatlas.org/BOTTOM/store_data.php. 13Of note, Trump won relatively more sparsely populated counties while Biden won relatively more densely populated counties. This explains that the mean of the variable “Trump Voting (2020)” is 63%. Note that our variables and estimates are unweighted throughout. We show that our results are robust to different weighting schemes in Baccini et al. (2020). 14The increase in the unemployment rate was much larger during the months of April and May 2020. Also note that the increase in unemployment does not include workers who are currently employed but are not working due to lockdowns. See Beland et al. (2020) for a discussion. 15We follow our PAP in using October 22, 2020, for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, we check the robustness of our results using other dates for calculating the number of COVID-19 cases. See the “3.3 section for more details. 16Relying on different months for the before and during COVID-19 periods has no effect on our conclusion that job losses are not related to differential voting behavior from the 2016 to the 2020 elections. 17https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/27/health/meat-processing-plants-coronavirus-intl/index.html(consulted on October 5, 2020). 18https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6927e2.htm (consulted on October 5 2020). 19News about these cases are distributed by the media across counties and have therefore a general effect, although these news may have more weights in counties with a large share of workers employed in meat-processing plants. 20https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-ratehttps://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2020/05/ewg-map-counties-meatpacking-plants-report-twice-national-average-rate(consulted on October 5 2020). 21https://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilitieshttps://www.thepigsite.com/news/2020/09/new-research-to-mitigate-covid-19-in-us-meat-and-poultry-processing-facilities(consulted on October 5, 2020). 22The China shock variable is a Bartik measure capturing rising Chinese imports to the USA in each industry i, weighted by baseline share of workers in the same industry i in each county. This variable varies both across counties and over time. The over-time variation is given by the difference in imports from China to the USA between 2000 (i.e., pre-accession to the WTO) to the period 2016–2019 (i.e., average value over this 4-year window). 23These variables are built by matching the list of targeted commodities (by China and the USA) to industry classifications and constructing an original measure of the county-level share of employment targeted in each round of retaliatory tariffs. Data come from Kim and Margalit (2021). 24We also implemented the plausibly exogenous test as suggested by Conley et al. (2012). The result of the test, which is available upon request, shows that our instrument is plausibly exogenous with p < 0.1. In other words, the effect of the instrumented variable, i.e., cases, remains negative with a 90% confidence interval. 25Press analyses indicate a positive correlation between COVID-19 cases and Trump’s support. See for instance, “Counties with worst virus surges overwhelmingly voted Trump” by AP news, available at https://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebfhttps://apnews.com/article/counties-worst-virus-surges-voted-trump-d671a483534024b5486715da6edb6ebf. 26We lose about 400 observations (i.e., counties) because of lack of data for our social distancing indicator. Excluding this control variable and doing the analysis on the full set of counties has no effect on our main conclusions. 27Using the change in unemployment for different dates does not affect our conclusions. For instance, measuring unemployment during the first wave of COVID-19 (i.e., April 2020) instead of the month of August 2020 leads to similar estimates and has no effect on the magnitude or significance of the COVID-19 cases variable. 28There are many plausible explanations for why our 2SLS estimates are larger than our OLS estimates. First, there is a great deal of measurement error in our estimation. Second, we are estimating a local average treatment effect (LATE) with our IV estimation. Voting behavior in counties with relatively more employment in meat-processing factories may be differently affected by the pandemic than counties with no or a small share of employment in this industry. For instance, counties with employment in meat-processing factories are significantly more populous than counties without any jobs in this industry. 29We classify Maine as a blue state. This has no effect on our conclusions. 30The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 inhabitants varies across Trump’s states (271) and Clinton’s states (166). 31We also tested the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and the differential in vote for Trump in red states, for states with and without stay-at-home order. Our 2SLS estimates suggest a large negative effect of COVID-19 cases on Trump’s vote for both sets of red states, but that the effect is larger for states without stay-at-home orders. 32We classify states as swing or non-swing using the NYT classification available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/electoral-college-battleground-states.html, consulted on November 2, 2020. We consider swing states as states categorized as tossup and leaning Democratic: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. 33There is a very small differences in death per capita since mid-September 2020 for counties with and without employment in meat-processing factories. 34We also find no evidence that the quadratic terms for COVID-19 deaths are related to Trump vote share in 2020 in comparison to 2016. 35We also investigate the impact of COVID-19 cases on the number of votes for Trump and the Democratic Party separately. The estimates are presented in Baccini et al. (2020). We do not find evidence that COVID-19 is related to the number of votes for Trump in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our OLS and 2SLS models. But we do find some evidence that COVID-19 cases are positively and significantly related to total votes for the Democratic Party in 2020 in comparison to 2016 in our 2SLS models. 36A number of studies provide suggestive evidence that air pollution may be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death (Wu et al. 2020). 37http://jedkolko.com/2020/10/18/the-geography-of-the-covid19-third-wave/ (consulted on November 2, 2020). 38Note that we only have data for statewide non-pharmaceutical interventions. One exception is for stay-at-home orders, which have been implemented by some cities and counties prior to statewide orders. Typically, the city or county order precedes the statewide order by few days. 39Our first stage F-statistics at the commuting zone-level are smaller than at the county-level, ranging around 10. The magnitude of the first stage coefficients is larger at the commuting zone-level than at the county-level, suggesting that COVID infections spread to neighboring counties.

WellnessGuide,Unlawful ‘malarkey’ robocall tells New Hampshire voters to stay home on primary day,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        E-Edition TRENDING: A robocall disturbing New Hampshire voters’ weekend calm is the AI election meddling everyone’s been predicting. The message spoofing the voice of President Biden and instructing people not to vote in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation primary is now under investigation, Gov. Chris Sununu told the Herald in Windham, N.H. Many Granite State voters’ phones rang early Sunday to a voice sounding suspiciously like the 46th president and employing his trademark “no malarkey” phrase. The fake commander-in-chief then went on to tell voters they should save their electoral energy for November’s general election. “Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the apparently AI-generated Biden voice told callers. “Your vote makes a difference in November, not this Tuesday.” Sununu, who was making the rounds Monday with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in an attempt to get out the vote before the primary, said that he’s aware of the call and that those responsible will be held accountable. “Our attorney general will completely look into it and into who is behind it. We have rules and laws in place,” he said. Sununu said the call violated state law and is “election interference.” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella’s Office seemed to agree. “These messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters. New Hampshire voters should disregard the content of this message entirely. Voting in the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election does not preclude a voter from additionally voting in the November General Election,” they wrote. Biden’s name will not appear on Tuesday’s ballot, after his campaign and the Democratic National Committee attempted to delay the New Hampshire primary in favor of starting the election cycle in South Carolina. The party was adamant about the issue, warning New Hampshire delegates may be disqualified if they went against party wishes. However, Granite State law says their election must occur before any other. The compromise was Biden sitting out the first primary, with efforts made to add his name as a write-in, and the state’s delegates potentially forfeit at the party’s convention. The DNC even went so far as to tell the state party’s chairman he should inform voters the primary was “meaningless,” only to have Formella’s office respond with a cease and desist order.

,,"    The president’s full-throated support of Israel’s war in Gaza continues to hurt him with young voters and voters of color—and the threat that Trump would be worse isn’t resonating. The 2024 presidential election is less than a year away, and polls continue to show President Joe Biden tied with or losing to future federal felon Donald Trump. While I don’t put much stock in polls taken a year before the election (at this point in 2011, Barack Obama would have lost the 2012 race to a plumber), Biden’s falling approval numbers with young voters and voters of color is frightening. In particular, Biden’s full-throated support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the low value he and his administration seem to place on the lives of Palestinians, appear to be hurting him with Arab American voters and young voters of all backgrounds. Plenty of Americans think Biden is doing the right thing in the Middle East. If you are one of those people, you should vote for Biden next November. Even the conservative Fox News commentator Brit Hume praised Biden’s leadership during this international crisis, so hopefully Biden can count on his vote. Best of luck with that. But there are other Americans—people no less important to Biden’s coalition, and more reliable as Democratic voters than Fox pundits—who view his foreign policy as aiding and abetting war crimes against the Palestinian people. Some Arab Americans have declared they simply will not vote for Biden (a recent poll found that just 17 percent of Arab Americans plan to vote for the president next year, sharply down from the 59 percent who supported him in 2020), and social media is awash with young people saying they will not vote for him either.

,Voters of color aren't happy with Biden. But we're not rushing to Trump's camp.,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently announced its latest tactic for electoral dominance: a $35 million campaign to “persuade and mobilize” voters of color to help them win back the U.S. House in November. It’s called ""P.O.W.E.R. (Persuade. Organize. Welcome. Educate. Reach.) The People,"" and it’s the largest expenditure for this purpose in recent memory. The move draws the latest battle line in the Democratic Party's crusade against the Republican Party and, by symbolic extension, former President Donald Trump. Yet, this desperate measure belies a subtler reality: President Joe Biden has become incredibly bad at marketing himself to voters of color. Although the president achieved an electoral victory in part with the help of those voters, his support is eroding: A recent NBC News poll found Black opposition to Biden growing from 12% in 2020 to 20% in November. A New York Times poll found a similar trend, with 22% of Black voters in six of the most important battleground states now supporting Trump. To those befuddled by this development, there’s only one question to ask: What did you expect? As a voter of color, I’m not convinced that the Democratic Party cares about anything besides stoking racial divisions to grab my vote − and its $35 million appeal hasn’t changed my mind. As strange as it might sound in the current political landscape in which both parties’ candidates advertise their primary quality as ""not being the other,"" the concept of earning votes actually matters to me and millions of other voters. To me, here’s how the Democratic Party's latest gambit sounds: “Let’s buy minorities’ votes, because we can’t procure votes through our actions.” But trying to buy votes you haven’t earned is not the strategy of a party worth moral consideration. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., diagnoses Biden’s woes as tactical: “My problem is that we have not been able to break through that MAGA wall in order to get to people exactly what this president has done.” This may well be part of the problem − although 20% support for Trump is hardly an insurmountable wall − but it’s not the main problem. Radio host Charlamagne tha God laid out his 2024 trilemma for Politico: Voters' options are “the cowards, the crooks and the couch.” Third-party candidates:Are you paying attention to the GOP primaries? You're missing the real campaign news. Minority support might be turning away from Biden, but we’re not exactly running en masse to the Trump camp. It’s not just a thin-but-loud MAGA wall the Democrats have to fight against: It’s also the strong urge to stay home in November, instead of throwing votes behind an incumbent who seems incapable of demonstrating the kind of care that a worthy candidate − or a presidential president − should be expressing. The Democrats, for whatever reason, cannot internalize this. They have instead opted to spend money without a meaningful strategy, execute a poor strategy to bad results, generate more money to “fix” bad results, rinse and repeat. Voters are desperate for something different − like a president capable of putting action to lofty words. I would like my president to both condemn white supremacy and refrain from hurling racially charged insults at Americans of color who commit the unpardonable sin of not voting for him. 2024 presidential election:New year will show us what America wants to be. Our USA TODAY Opinion team is hopeful – and worried. No American voter, regardless of color, is a prize to be won by hitting the right donation threshold. Because of this failure, as per the Charlamagne trilemma, the Democratic Party is losing voters to the couch. As of now, Democratic leaders have given us no compelling reason to save them from their fate.

,A fake Biden robocall is telling New Hampshire primary voters to stay home," MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (Reuters) — As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state’s first-in-the nation primary Tuesday, a robocall is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home—using a fake audio of U.S. President Joe Biden. “It’s important that you save your vote for the November election. . . . voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,” the call says. The New Hampshire attorney general, John Formella, announced he is investigating what he called an apparent “unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters.” “The Election Law Unit’s investigation is ongoing,” he said. The audio of the call was provided to Reuters by supporters of a campaign to encourage voters to write in Biden’s name on their ballots. Biden’s campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was “disinformation” and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden’s write-in campaign will be closely watched amid weak polls for the 81-year-old president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party’s nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden’s name is not on the ballot Tuesday, because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire’s historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden “voice” is heard using one of his signature phrases, “What a bunch of malarkey.” The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair. Sullivan called the robocall an attempt at election interference, and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated. In a statement, Sullivan said she was made aware of it on Sunday night. “Multiple people have described receiving a phony voice message created through AI that mimics the voice of President Biden, in an attempt to suppress their participation in the upcoming New Hampshire primary,” she said. She said the call links back to her personal cell phone number without her permission. The explosion of generative AI—which can create text, photos, and videos in response to open-ended prompts—in recent months has spurred both excitement about its potential as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections, and even possibly overpower humans. The campaign for former President Donald Trump said it was “absolutely not” involved in the robocall. The campaign for Democrat Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said it was not involved. The Phillips campaign said it found out about the call from a reporter on Sunday night. “Any effort to discourage voters is disgraceful and an unacceptable affront to democracy. The potential use of AI to manipulate voters is deeply disturbing,” the Phillips campaign said. —By Steve Holland, Reuters Now accepting applications for Innovation by Design.

I've even challenged hundreds of people posing similar questions to speak to Trump's accomplishments, and zero reasonable or meritable responses have come forward. In popularity: contested, and I don't know why. I realize Biden wasn't the Democrats’ first choice, even as a primary, but everyone understood he was the only choice on the table if they wanted to avoid a second term out of Trump. There are no viable contenders on the DNC side to replace Biden. Marianne Williamson is a joke, full stop. Dean Phillips, to me, comes off a    Nope. When Trump ends up the nominee, people will show up at the polls to keep his seditious ass out of office. Opinion polls are worthless this early. I certainly consider the Proud Boys and their ilk to be illegal terrorist groups, but it seems Biden has quieted them up quite a bit. They are certainly known for flipping off cops and even judges along with skipping out on bail which is why so many have been held in jail pending trial. With the taking of Michigan, it looks like at this point (1:44pmPST) that Biden will win this. Biden only needs now to take Nevada and Arizona, and he is leading in those states at this point. Clark County, the largest county in Nevada, leans heavily Biden and those results are just pouring in now. Biden has at this hour 253 electoral votes with the capture of Michigan. Together, Nevada and Arizona have 17 electoral votes. Those two states together will put him right at 270, and Pennsylvania, while leaning Trump at the moment, still could go to Biden. But Biden won’t need Pennsylvania or Georgia        ",https://www.quora.com/If-democrats-don-t-want-to-vote-for-Biden-then-who-If-Trump-wins-because-Democrats-sit-at-home-because-they-wanted-someone-else-will-they-be-happy-then,
,GOP voters ready for Georgia runoffs despite Trump’s claims,"ATLANTA — Many Republican voters in Georgia are angry. They’re convinced that widespread voter fraud — claims that are baseless — cost President Donald Trump the election to Democrat Joe Biden. But will those concerns put them on the sidelines for runoff elections Jan. 5 that will determine party control of the U.S. Senate? No way, said Trump supporter Lori Davis. “Everyone that I’m around, we’re ready to vote now,” said the 57-year-old businesswoman, as she awaited the arrival of Vice-President Mike Pence at a rally for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Augusta on Thursday. Trump has relentlessly promoted false claims that the election was rigged against him and he has savaged Republican elected officials he perceives as standing in the way of his quest to subvert the results. Some Trump allies have gone as far as calling for voters to skip the Georgia runoffs altogether — alarming words for the GOP campaigns banking on a strong turnout. But interviews with voters and party activists in the state suggest there’s little sign that Trump’s voters are planning to stay home in protest. Most Republican voters interviewed said they were prepared to put their skepticism aside to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in their races against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively. “There are people who are discouraged about (Trump) losing Georgia or being behind. But I haven’t talked to people who’ve said, ‘Oh, the heck with this, it’s all rigged anyway,’” said Tim Phillips, president of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which has done canvassing of GOP-leaning voters. Phillips was among those who worried that the distrust could affect Republican enthusiasm. But he said his group’s weeks in the field, combined with a recent visit from Trump, have eased his worries. Trump’s Dec. 5 campaign stop in Valdosta, Georgia, was his first since he lost the state to Biden by about 11,700 votes — a result that was confirmed by two recounts, including a hand tally of all ballots. But those recounts haven’t stopped the president from blasting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Kemp has rebuffed Trump’s call for a special session of the legislature to subvert the election results, while Raffensperger has repeatedly said there is no evidence of systemic fraud or irregularities in the November election. Trump and his allies have continued to push false claims of fraud. Trump turned up the heat on Kemp via Twitter early Monday, pushing him to take action on the requests for legislative action or hamper the reelection bids of incumbents Perdue and Loeffler. “What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is,” Trump tweeted. “Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th.” Sidney Powell, who was removed from Trump’s legal team last month, has teamed up with Georgia attorney Lin Wood, who is known for his representation of several high-profile clients, particularly in defamation cases. The lawyers have repeatedly encouraged Georgia Republicans not to vote in the runoff election and questioned whether Perdue and Loeffler have sufficiently backed Trump’s efforts. “Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election?” Wood said during a recent rally in a suburb north of Atlanta. Trump has asked his supporters to get out and vote. The “seats are the last line of defence to save America and protect all that we’ve accomplished,” he said at the recent Georgia event. During the rally, Trump weaved back and forth between pressing his own grievances about the election and encouraging the crowd to turn out for Perdue and Loeffler. “You know a lot of people, friends of mine, say ‘Let’s not vote. We’re not going to vote because we’re angry about the presidential election,’” Trump told the crowd. “But if you do that, the radical left wins,” he said. Phillips said he believes that message is getting through to the conservative base much more so than any isolated calls for boycotts or even the president’s broadsides against Kemp and Raffensperger. “These aren’t people taking their cues from CNN or conventional political media. They listen to the president directly. And they’re open to his message and our message of not letting (Democratic Senate leader) Chuck Schumer finish the job,” Phillips said. Republicans are depending on voters such as Terry McCreary, a 65-year-old retiree in Cherokee County. McCreary calls himself a “conservative independent,” but he’s voted almost exclusively for Republicans since casting presidential ballots for Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s. McCreary says he finds it “hard to believe” Biden won the election fair and square. McCreary cites several misleading and disproven theories that Trump and his allies have pushed in recent weeks. “It just doesn’t feel right,” he said from his home in the Atlanta suburbs. But none of that, McCreary said, will keep him from voting in the runoffs. “I’m concerned about the election on Jan. 5” being legitimate, he said. “But I always vote. Every time.” Perdue and Loeffler have tried to placate Trump and his supporters by backing a lawsuit from Texas that sought to overturn Biden’s win but was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday, and by calling for Raffensperger to resign, citing unspecified “mismanagement” in the election. Nonetheless, they’ve faced pushback from hardcore Trump supporters. As the pair strained to speak at Trump’s rally in Valdosta, cries of “Fight for Trump” filled the crowd, largely drowning out the senators. Jeanne Seaver, a Republican activist in Georgia who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign, said she believes that Republican voters will still come out to support Perdue and Loeffler despite the anger on the ground. “I think if Donald Trump says get out and vote for Kelly and David, then the Trump folks are loyal to Donald Trump and will get out and vote,” Seaver said. ___ Associated Press writers Meg Kinnard in Augusta, Georgia and Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.

,Political positions of Joe Biden,"   Joe Biden, President of the United States, served as Vice President from 2009 to 2017 and in the United States Senate from 1973 until 2009. A member of the Democratic Party, he made his second presidential run in 2008, later being announced as Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama's running mate in 2008. He was elected vice president in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. In April 2019, Biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign.[1] He became the presumptive Democratic nominee in April 2020,[2] was formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August 2020,[3] and defeated Republican incumbent Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.[4] Over his career, Biden has generally been regarded as belonging to the mainstream of the Democratic Party.[5][6] Biden has been described as center[7][8][9] to center-left[10] and has described himself as the latter.[11] Figures farther to the left such as Bernie Sanders have criticized Biden for not embracing Medicare for All or the Green New Deal. Biden's policies emphasize the needs of middle-class and working-class Americans[12] and have drawn political support from those groups.[13] Biden has supported campaign finance reform including the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and overturning Citizens United;[14][15] the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act;[16] the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009;[17][18] student tax credits;[19] carbon emissions cap and trade;[20] the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the Obama administration;[18] mass transit;[21] renewable energy subsidies;[20] student loan forgiveness;[22] and reversals of Republican tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.[23][12][24] He supports building upon the Affordable Care Act through a public health insurance option instead of a single-payer system.[25][26] He supports decriminalizing cannabis at the federal level and the right for states to legalize it.[27] Biden has been publicly in favor of same-sex marriage since 2012 when he became the highest-ranking U.S. official to voice support for same-sex marriage, preempting Obama on the subject.[28] He also supports the Roe v. Wade decision and since 2019 has been in favor of repealing the Hyde Amendment.[29][30] In a 2019 article about Biden's record on abortion, his press secretary Jamal Brown said that when Biden arrived in the Senate in 1973 he thought Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, but now ""firmly believes that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land and should not be overturned"". In 1981, he voted for a failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe v. Wade. In 1982, he voted against the same failed constitutional amendment allowing states to overturn Roe, and in 2006, he stated in an interview that ""I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy[.]""[31] He now says he would consider codifying the Roe precedent into federal law in case the United States Supreme Court overturns the ruling.[32][33] He pledged that he would appoint United States Supreme Court justices who shared his beliefs in upholding Roe.[34] From 1976 to June 5, 2019, Biden supported the Hyde Amendment.[35][36] On June 6, 2019, Biden reversed his support and now supports repealing the Hyde Amendment.[37] In 1981, he voted to end federal funding for abortion for victims of rape and incest.[32] Biden previously supported the Mexico City policy, but now supports repealing it.[33] In 2003, Biden voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.[38] In 2007, he opposed the United States Supreme Court ruling in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart which upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. He defended his opposition, saying he opposed the court's reasoning for the ruling, not the decision itself.[39] In the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's leading opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[40] In his first Senate campaign, Biden expressed support for busing to remedy de jure segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy de facto segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[41] In May 1974, Biden voted to table a proposal containing anti-busing and anti-desegregation clauses but later voted for a modified version containing a qualification that it was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the 5th Amendment and 14th Amendment.[42] Later, Biden was heckled when he told a meeting of Delaware parents that his position on busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions.[further explanation needed][43] This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with anti-busing senators.[40] In 1975, he supported a proposal that would have prevented the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from cutting federal funds to districts that refused to integrate;[44] he said busing was a ""bankrupt idea [violating] the cardinal rule of common sense"" and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.[45] At the same time he supported initiatives on housing, job opportunities, and voting rights.[42] In 1977 Biden then voted against integration stating he did not want his children going to school in a ""racial jungle"". Biden supported a measure[when?] forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them. In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1978.[46] Biden has supported affirmative action policies.[47] Since June 20, 2019, Biden opposes capital punishment. Biden supports legislation to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and incentivize states to abolish capital punishment. He supports individuals on death row instead serving life sentences without probation or parole.[48][49] Prior to June 20, 2019, he had supported capital punishment. He originally wrote the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The Act included Title VI, the Federal Death Penalty Act, creating 60 new death penalty offenses under 41 federal capital statutes,[50] for crimes related to acts of terrorism, murder of a federal law enforcement officer, civil rights-related murders, drive-by shootings resulting in death, the use of weapons of mass destruction resulting in death, and carjackings resulting in death. However, he voted against limiting appeals in capital cases and also opposed rejecting racial statistics in death penalty appeals.[citation needed] Biden helped author the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which deployed and trained more police officers, increased prison sentences, and built more prisons. The bill led to a decrease in crime rates[citation needed] while also introducing the Violence Against Women Act. Part of the bill was an assault weapon ban and additional money was redirected towards crime prevention programs. Some critics say that the law had the unintended by-effect of creating a financial incentive for jailing people and keeping them there for longer periods of time; this had a disproportionate impact on minorities.[51] In the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a slogan of ""defund the police"" arose, which some interpreted to mean the abolition of police departments. Biden stated in a June 2020 opinion piece, ""While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police."" President Donald Trump and his allies have claimed that Biden supports ""defunding police""; the Trump campaign spent at least $20 million in July 2020 on campaign ads promoting the falsehood.[52][53] As a senator, Biden had long forged deep relationships with police groups and was a chief proponent of a Police Officer's Bill of Rights measure which was supported by police unions but opposed by police chiefs.[54][55] As a 2020 presidential candidate, Biden faced criticism from some on the left for his proposal to double federal spending for community policing programs, to $300 million.[56] He called for racial justice while speaking at George Floyd's funeral service.[57] In September 2020, he condemned the institutional racism in the United States and police violence against African American communities.[58] Biden earned a reputation for being a ""drug warrior"", leading efforts in the war on drugs.[59] During the 1980s crack epidemic when both Democrats and Republicans were ""tough on crime"", Biden was the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee that passed numerous punitive measures against drug offenders. In 1986, Biden sponsored and co-wrote the Anti-Drug Abuse Act which caused a large disparity between the sentencing of crack cocaine and powder cocaine users. Black drug users were more likely than whites to use crack and hence were incarcerated in larger numbers.[60][61] He later acknowledged the negative consequences of the legislation and in 2010 supported the Fair Sentencing Act.[62] The bill eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine, and aimed to reduce the disparity in sentencing between crack and powder cocaine offenses.[63] Biden favored increased funding for anti-drug efforts. He frequently criticized President Ronald Reagan in this regard,[64] stating in 1982 that the administration's ""commitment is minuscule in terms of dollars"".[65] He also criticized President George H. W. Bush's anti-drug strategy as ""not tough enough, bold enough or imaginative enough"",[66] stating that ""what we need is another D-Day, not another Vietnam, not a limited war, fought on the cheap"".[64] In 1982, Biden advocated for the creation of a drug czar, a government official overseeing all anti-drug operations. This led to the establishment of the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.[59] Biden also supported increased penalties against those caught selling drugs within 1,000 feet of schools.[67] Biden advocated for increased use of civil asset forfeiture by law enforcement agencies.[66] Biden played a key part in the passage of the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act in 1983, partnering with Strom Thurmond, a conservative Republican. A Washington Post article described Biden's role in the negotiations: ""He got the Democrats to agree to strengthen forfeiture laws and allow judges to hold more defendants without bail; he persuaded the Republicans to drop such controversial provisions as a federal death penalty, and he made sure Thurmond got most of the credit. Civil liberties groups said the measure could have been far worse without Biden.""[68] In the early 2000s, Biden was critical of raves, describing most of them as ""havens"" for use of ecstasy and other illegal drugs.[69] He was the sponsor of the bipartisan Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy (RAVE) Act in 2002; the bill's successor, the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, was later enacted as part of a broader 2003 crime bill that became law.[69][70] The legislation, an expansion of the existing 1986 federal anti-""crack house"" statute, provided for civil and criminal penalties for event promoters and property owners/managers who knowingly allowed their property to be used for sale or consumption of drugs.[71] The legislation was opposed by the ACLU and electronic dance music enthusiasts who viewed it as overly broad.[70][72] Responding to criticism, Biden said that the statute would not target law-abiding promoters, saying on the Senate floor: ""The reason I introduced this bill was not to ban dancing, kill 'the rave scene' or silence electronic music—all things of which I have been accused. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or expression. It is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids.""[70] Although the law has been rarely used, advocates such as Drug Policy Alliance and DanceSafe argue that it discourages event producers from engaging in harm reduction efforts, and have sought to clarify the law.[73] Biden opposed the legalization of marijuana as a young senator in 1974, in contrast to his other more liberal views.[74] In 2010 he maintained this position, stating: ""I still believe it's a gateway drug. I've spent a lot of my life as chairman of the Judiciary Committee dealing with this. I think it would be a mistake to legalize.""[66] In a 2014 interview, Biden said, ""I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resources"" but said, ""Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization.""[75] In 2019 and 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden expressed support for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing medical marijuana; reclassifying it as a Schedule II drug to ease marijuana research; automatically expunging prior convictions for marijuana convictions; and allowing states to legalize without federal interference.[76][77] In October 2022, President Biden announced that all federal convictions for simple marijuana possession would be pardoned, while also announcing that he would initiate a review to determine how cannabis should be scheduled under federal law, adding that the Schedule I classification of cannabis ""makes no sense"".[78][79] As Vice President, Biden actively engaged with Central American leaders on issues of drug cartels, drug trafficking, and migration to the U.S. caused by insecurity and drug violence. (See Central America below.) Biden was a major author of the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990[80] and voted in favor of the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994.[81] He voted in favor of the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, but in 2007 called for the legislation to be scrapped or overhauled.[82] He supports class size reductions and investment in early childhood education.[82] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has proposed tripling Title I funds (which go to low-income schools) to pay for increases in student supports and teacher salaries; doubling the number of school guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, and nurses; providing for universal prekindergarten, and fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act within a decade.[80] Biden also supports federal infrastructure legislation providing funding for school buildings; allowing high school students to use Pell Grants for dual enrollment; and expanding career and technical education through school/community college/employer partnerships.[80] Biden opposes federal funding for for-profit charter schools (which make up a small percentage of charter schools)[83][84] and opposes ""private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer–funded resources away from the public school system.""[84] He supports allowing parents and students to choose between traditional public schools, magnet schools and ""high-performing"" charter schools.[84] Biden's plans have been praised by the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers,[83] the major U.S. teachers' unions, which both endorsed Biden in 2020.[85][86] In April 2020, Biden proposed forgiving student debt from public colleges and universities and minority-serving institutions, for people earning up to $125,000 per year.[22] Throughout his career, Biden has supported gun control measures.[87] Although he voted for the 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act, a bill supported by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) that passed the Senate 79–15, Biden also authored the 1993 federal assault weapons ban, and is a longtime supporter of universal background checks, and received ""F"" ratings from the NRA while he was in Congress.[88] The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[89][90] Biden supported the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which established five-day waiting periods for handgun purchases and background checks.[91] He had a central role in the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which banned the manufacture, transfer, or possession of certain firearms classified as assault weapons (with a grandfather clause excepting guns owned prior to its implementation).[92] After the ban expired in 2004, Biden voted in favor of renewing it in a 2007 Senate vote.[87] The Obama/Biden administration also unsuccessfully pressed for renewal of the ban.[92] Biden voted against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) of 2005, which immunizes firearm manufacturers from lawsuits based on gun violence.[87] After the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012, Obama named Biden to lead a task force on gun violence and community safety.[93][94][95] Biden and the administration proposed universal background checks (with an exception for gun transfers between family members),[96] resumption of public health research on gun violence, and reinstatement of the federal assault weapons ban.[93][94][95] Proposals requiring legislative action were killed in the Republican-controlled Congress[93][94][95] amid opposition from the NRA.[96] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden's proposals on gun violence include universal background checks for gun sales, repeal of PLCAA, reinstatement of the assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines, and incentives for states to adopt red flag laws.[94] Biden owns two shotguns.[97][98] After the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, a domestic terrorist attack, Biden drafted anti-terrorist legislation, which was ultimately defeated. He later claimed publicly on several occasions that the USA PATRIOT Act, which eased restrictions on the Executive branch in the surveillance and detention of those suspected of terrorism or facilitating it, was essentially a duplicate of the anti-terrorist legislation he had drafted years earlier.[99] Biden supported the PATRIOT Act but voted to limit wiretapping on the bill. He supports implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to fight terrorists but voted to preserve habeas corpus rights to the alleged terror suspects serving in Guantanamo Bay. In the 1990s, he voted in favor of 36 vetoed military projects and supports efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. He was given a 60% approval rating from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reflecting a mixed voting record on civil rights issues. During a debate on November 15, 2007, Biden clarified the PATRIOT Act's effect, his continued support for it, and his opposition to racial profiling.[100] On the War on Terror, Biden voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.[101][102] While in the Senate, Biden voted in favor of the 1986 immigration bill (which passed) and the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill (which failed).[103] In a 2007 Democratic presidential primary debate, Biden said that it would be impractical and expensive to deport every unauthorized immigrant in the U.S. and proposed an earned path to citizenship, saying: ""Get a background check on all of them, take out the criminals, get them back, and provide for a means by which we allow earned citizenship over the next decade or so. Folks, being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical.""[104] Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized and partially funded the construction of fencing along the Mexican border,[105] mostly as a means to combat cross-border drug trafficking.[104] During the same campaign, Biden said that would not allow sanctuary cities to ignore federal law.[106] In 2007, Biden said that illegal immigration would not stop unless U.S. employers stopped hiring undocumented workers, saying: ""All the rest is window dressing.""[107] As vice president, Biden supported the 2013 bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, a bill crafted by the Gang of Eight (four Democratic, four Republican senators) that would have created a 13-year pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants with security checks, devoted unprecedented resources to border security, created a new work visa program, and established a mandatory employment verification system to ensure that persons hired are authorized to work in the U.S. As president of the Senate, Biden personally presided over the Senate when the bill passed 68–32.[108][109] The legislation failed, however, in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.[110] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden issued his ""Biden Plan for Securing Our Values as a Nation of Immigrants,"" in which he pledged to ""secure our border, while ensuring the dignity of migrants and upholding their legal right to seek asylum. ... enforce our laws without targeting communities, violating due process, or tearing apart families,"" ""ensure our values are squarely at the center of our immigration and enforcement policies,"" and create a ""fair and humane immigration system.""[111] Biden's proposals would undo Trump's immigration policies,[112][113] which Biden has criticized as immoral, inhumane, ineffective, economically damaging, and unconstitutional.[111] Biden said he would raise the annual ceiling for refugees from 15,000 (the historically low level set under the Trump administration) to 125,000 (higher than the Obama-era ceiling).[114] He pledged a reversal of the Trump administration's family separation policy, travel/refugee bans, and severe restrictions on asylum,[111][113] calling these policies ""cruel and senseless"" and ""un-American.""[111] If elected, he pledges to reverse Trump's public charge rule and ""so-called National Emergency,"" which diverted money from the Defense Department to construct a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[111] Biden criticized Trump's promotion of a border wall, noting that smuggling through legal ports of entry, rather than simple illicit border-crossing, is the dominant method by which illicit drugs enter the U.S., and that ""sophisticated criminal organizations"" can easily circumvent physical barriers through ""border tunnels, semi-submersible vessels, and aerial technology.""[111] Biden has called for better security along the border and at ports of entry through technology and infrastructure (such as ""cameras, sensors, large-scale x-ray machines, and fixed towers"") as well as through improved coordination between federal agencies, as well as Mexican and Canadian authorities.[111] During his 2020 campaign, Biden proposed a ""surge"" of humanitarian resources to the border and restoration of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for undocumented youth raised in the United States (the ""Dreamers"").[111] As a longer-term goal, Biden said he supported a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants currently in the United States.[112][113] Biden also pledged to create a program to allow U.S. military veterans deported by the Trump Administration to return to the United States.[111] He supports evidence-based alternatives to prolonged immigration detention,[111] and a ban on for-profit detention centers.[112] Biden does not support abolition of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as some on the left-wing have called for, but said that his administration would ensure that ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers ""abide by professional standards and are held accountable for inhumane treatment.""[112] Biden does not support the decriminalization of unauthorized border-crossing,[112] but pledged to restore ""sensible enforcement priorities"" that focus deportation and other enforcement efforts on persons convicted of serious crimes.[113][111] rather than people ""who have lived, worked, and contributed to our economy and our communities for decades.""[111] To address a backlog in the immigration courts, Biden proposed a doubling of the number of immigration judges and interpreters.[112] Biden also opposes Trump's attempts to withhold federal grant funding from sanctuary cities.[106] Regarding migrant crises, Biden's 2020 immigration policy emphasized a need to address the root causes of migration from the Central America's Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, such as endemic instability, corruption, gang violence and gender-based violence, and a lack of the rule of law. Biden pledged to update the Central American Minors Program and advance humanitarian aid, stability, and economic development in the region. He also stated that he would use the Temporary Protected Status program for persons whose countries of origin suffer from violence or unsafe conditions.[111][113] In 2006, in its Technology Issues Voter's Guide, CNET.com gave Biden a score of 37.5% on his Senate voting record.[115][116] Biden was a co-sponsor of the Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act of 2007.[117] Biden also sponsored two bills, the Comprehensive Counter-Terrorism Act (SB 266) and the Violent Crime Control Act (SB 618), both of which contained language seen as effectively banning encryption.[118] Crypto notes Biden wrote that language into the text of SB 266.[119] Phil Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, has said it was SB 266 that ""led [him] to publish PGP electronically for free that year, shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups.""[120] He later stated in a Slashdot article that he was not specifically criticizing Biden, that he would consider the Senator's ""whole body of work"" when considering whether to vote for him on the Democratic ticket in 2008 and that ""considering the disastrous erosion in our privacy and civil liberties under the (Bush) administration, I feel positively nostalgic about Biden's quaint little non-binding resolution of 1991"".[121] While in the Senate, Biden voted in 1993 for a broad defense bill that included the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law on LGBT service in the U.S. military, after voting to remove the amendment.[28][122][123] As vice president, Biden supported the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which repealed the prohibition on open service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in the U.S. military.[122] In 1996, Biden voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act which prohibited the federal government from recognizing any same-sex marriage, barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law, and allowing states to do the same.[124] In the Senate, Biden was an outspoken critic of congressional Republicans' efforts in the 2000s to adopt a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage; in arguing against the proposal in 2004, Biden cited his position that same-sex marriage was an issue for states to decide.[28] During the lead up to the 2008 US presidential election he said ""In an Obama-Biden administration, there will be absolutely no distinction from a constitutional standpoint or a legal standpoint between a same-sex and a heterosexual couple"" and that they both opposed ""redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage"".[125] In a May 2012 Meet the Press interview, Vice President Biden reversed his previous position and publicly supported same-sex marriage, saying he was ""absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that.""[126] Prior to Biden's statement on Meet the Press, the Obama administration endorsed civil unions, but not same-sex marriage.[127] Biden's decision reportedly forced Obama's hand, pressuring Obama to accelerate his own public shift to support same-sex marriage.[128][129] In 2013, Section 3 of DOMA was ruled unconstitutional and partially struck down in United States v. Windsor. The Obama Administration did not defend the law and congratulated Windsor.[130] Biden supported the U.S. Supreme Court's 5–4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which held that same-sex couples have a federal constitutional right to marry. Biden issued a statement saying that the ruling reflected a principle that ""all people should be treated with respect and dignity – and that all marriages, at their root, are defined by unconditional love.""[131] In an event with the group Freedom to Marry, Biden described the decision as ""the civil rights movement of our generation"" and as consequential as Brown v. Board of Education.[132] Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the case, endorsed Biden's 2020 presidential run, as did other LGBT leaders.[133] Biden supports the Equality Act, proposed federal legislation that would extend the nondiscrimination protections of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cover discrimination ""on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes.""[134] The legislation would protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination across the country in housing, public accommodations, public education, credit, and the jury system, in addition to current federal employment protections.[135] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden vowed to support legislation and action to prohibit discrimination against transgender people and to combat hate crimes targeting LGBT persons, including violence and harassment against transgender people.[136][137][138] However, his administration proposed a regulation to allow schools to bar transgender athletes from competitive teams, a decision which was strongly opposed by transgender advocates.[139][140][141][142] He has criticized Republicans, and particularly Vice President Mike Pence, for using ""religious freedom as an excuse to license discrimination.""[137][138] He supports the Safe Schools Improvement Act, a proposed anti-bullying law.[137] Biden has mentioned Catholic social teaching as an influence on his personal political beliefs.[143] At a November 2011 campaign event, in response to a question about how Biden viewed Mitt Romney's Mormon faith in November 2011, Biden said, ""I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision. It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way.""[144] Biden cited the anti-Catholic prejudice encountered by John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.[145] In 1991, Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when it held confirmation hearings on Republican President George H. W. Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. During the nomination process, Thomas was accused of a consistent pattern of sexual harassment, to which Anita Hill testified before the committee.[146] During the hearing, Biden referred to an inconclusive FBI report on the accusations by Hill as ""he said, she said.""[147] Biden refused to call other women who were willing to testify against Thomas as corroborating witnesses.[148] He voted against Thomas's confirmation both in the committee and on the Senate floor.[149] In 2017, Biden apologized to Hill over her treatment in the hearings, stating: ""Let's get something straight here, I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas... I am so sorry that she had to go through what she went through. Think of the courage that it took for her to come forward.""[150] Speaking in 2018, Biden expressed regret about not being more firm in preventing Senate colleagues on the committee from engaging in what he called ""character assassination"" of Hill, saying: ""Anita Hill was vilified when she came forward, by a lot of my colleagues, I wish I could have done more to prevent those questions and the way they asked them....Under the Senate rules, I can't gavel you down and say you can't ask that question, although I tried. And so what happened was she got victimized again during the process.""[151] In 1994, Biden drafted the Violence Against Women Act; some suggest this was drafted in light of criticism Biden had received following the treatment of Anita Hill.[152] This law provided $1.6 billion to enhance investigation and prosecution of the violent crime perpetrated against women, increased pre-trial detention of the accused, provided for automatic and mandatory restitution of those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave unprosecuted. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the VAWA on Constitutional grounds in United States v. Morrison. Biden has said, ""I consider the Violence Against Women Act the single most significant legislation that I've crafted during my 35-year tenure in the Senate. Indeed, the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault. Our nation has been rewarded for this commitment. Since the Act's passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50%.""[153] He has also said that the Act ""empower[s] women to make changes in their lives, and by training police and prosecutors to arrest and convict abusive husbands instead of telling them to take a walk around the block"".[154] In 2017, Biden told a group of students that having sex with a woman while she is drunk is rape.[155] Biden supported the 2008 farm bill, calling it a ""responsible compromise.""[156] When he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden identified agricultural development and global food prices as major issues.[156] While in the Senate, Biden called for strong action against invasive species, citing the economic and environmental risks associated with them, including displacement of native shipping, the introduction of disease, and interference with shipping.[156] In the Senate, Biden paid particular attention to issues affecting the poultry industry, which is economically important to Delaware, especially in the Delmarva peninsula.[156] In the 1990s, Biden criticized the Russian government for threatening to ban imported U.S. chicken,[156] and in 2008 criticized the Russian government for banning imports of chicken from 19 poultry processing plants in the United States, Biden stated that ""Russia is once again using non-tariff barriers as an excuse to close its markets to American poultry. ... Russia has repeatedly shown that it is not ready to abide by the rules of international trade.""[157] Biden described the Russian action as ""part of a bigger picture in which Russia has failed to behave as a responsible member in the international community"" and called for the U.S. to block Russia's application to join the World Trade Organization.[157] Biden also worked to promote funding to research avian influenza.[156] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has outlined a rural and agricultural policy broadly similar to that of the Obama administration. The plan aims to obtain net zero emissions for agriculture (making the U.S. the first nation to do so) via incentives and permitting farmers to join carbon markets. The plan also calls for changes in trade policy to encourage U.S. agriculture exports; expansion of broadband Internet in rural areas; renewable energy investment; promotion of local and regional food; and an expansion of the USDA Conservation Stewardship Program to encourage farmers to adopt carbon sequestration and other environmental practices.[158] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation, which was sought by MBNA, one of Delaware's largest companies and Biden's largest contributor in the late 1990s,[51] and other credit card issuers.[159] He fought for certain amendments to the bill that would indirectly protect homeowners and forbid felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines.[159] He also worked to defeat amendments which would have protected members of the military and those who are pushed into bankruptcy by medical debt. Critics expressed concern that the law would force those seeking bankruptcy protection to hire lawyers to process the required paperwork, making it more difficult for students to execute education-related debt.[51] The overall bill was vetoed by President Bill Clinton in 2000, but then finally passed as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005, with Biden supporting it.[159] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden moved to the left on the issue, endorsing Senator Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy reform proposal, which would roll back many aspects of the 2005 law.[160][161][162] During and after the Obama/Biden administration, Biden strongly supported the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented new financial regulations designed to prevent a reprise of the 2008 financial crisis. The Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.[163][164][165] He also supported the pro-consumer Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act.[165] Biden has been credited with introducing the first climate change bill in Congress.[166] Biden's initial bill, the Global Climate Protection Act, was introduced in 1986; it died in the Senate, but a version was included in a bill signed into law by President Reagan as an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act in December 1987.[166] In 2008, Biden was the lead sponsor of a ""Sense of the Senate"" resolution calling on the U.S. to be a part of the United Nations climate change negotiations, and was a co-sponsor of the Boxer-Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, at the time the most stringent climate bill in the Senate. The legislation would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions and required a reduction in U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.[167] He strongly opposed opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling,[168][169] although when he became president, he only called for a temporary moratorium instead.[170] In 2007–2008, during his presidential campaign, Biden called for a gradual increase in automobile fuel-economy standards to 40 miles per gallon by 2017,[167] called for increase production of renewable energy,[167] and identified energy security and resolving the energy crisis as key priorities.[171] In June 2019, Biden's presidential campaign unveiled a $1.7 trillion climate policy plan aiming to eliminate U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The proposal incorporated elements of the Green New Deal proposal but lacked many key aspects, such as less funding, no healthcare expansion, no guaranteed jobs or benefits, less guaranteed housing, and no bans on fracking.[172] Biden's plan would eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; halt issuance of new permits for oil and gas extraction on public land and water; step up Clean Air Act enforcement; strengthen fuel economy standards to promote a shift to electric vehicles; regulate methane pollution; and create ""aggressive"" energy efficiency standards for appliances and buildings.[173] Biden also promised that he would re-enter the Paris Agreement (from which Trump pulled the U.S.) on his first day in the White House and called for ""a major diplomatic push to raise the ambitions of countries' climate targets.""[173] To pressure countries failing to meet their climate obligations, Biden also called for ""carbon adjustment fees"" to be levied on goods imported from countries that failed to meet emissions targets.[173] The plan also won considerable support from the fossil fuel industry.[174] Biden's Green New Deal plan is incorporated in his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, which would in part lead to the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps.[175] In November 2021, Biden promised to end and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030,[176] in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.[177][178] A week after the November closing of COP26 the Biden administration held the largest federal gas and oil lease auction in U.S. history, selling 1.7 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The areas can be expected to produce around 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.12 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years. In January 2021, the administration put a pause on new federal gas and oil leasing but was sued to open them for sale by several Republican-led states. When a federal judge sided with the states Biden appealed the decision but agreed to continue with the sales. The administration has also proposed another round of gas and oil lease sales in 2022, in Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states.[179][180] In 2022, Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which represents the largest investment into addressing climate change in United States history.[181] During the Obama administration, Biden was the lead figure promoting the administration's proposal to spend $53 billion over six years toward construction of a national intercity high-speed rail network, in furtherance of Obama's goal (outlined in the 2011 State of the Union Address) to extend high-speed rail access to 80% of the American population over a quarter-century.[182][183][184] Republicans in Congress rejected the proposal, which did not advance.[185][186] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden released a $1.3 trillion infrastructure improvement plan, which would follow up on Obama administration priorities.[187] The plan calls for $50 billion investment in repairs to existing roads and bridges in his first year in office; $10 billion over a decade to transit construction in high-poverty parts of the U.S.; doubling funding for BUILD and INFRA grants, and more funds for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.[187] The plan also includes proposals for investments in high-speed rail, public transit, and bicycling,[186] as well as school construction, replacement of water pipes and other water infrastructure, and expansion of rural broadband.[188] The plan also specifically calls for the rebuilding of the Hudson River Tunnel and the expansion of the Northeast Corridor, as well as rail investments in California and the Midwest and West.[186] Biden proposed funding the plan through tax increases on high-income Americans and corporations; the campaign stated that ""reversing the excesses of the Trump tax cuts for corporations; reducing incentives for tax havens, evasion, and outsourcing; ensuring corporations pay their fair share; closing other loopholes in our tax code that reward wealth, not work; and ending subsidies for fossil fuels"" would provide the revenue for the plan, making it deficit-neutral.[188] A long-term rider and advocate of Amtrak, during his 2020 campaign, Biden said that, if elected, his administration would ""spark the second great railroad revolution"" and move to electrify Amtrak trains.[189] He also voiced support for 2,000 Amtrak workers furloughed due to Trump administration budget cuts, although he did not take a specific position on Amtrak personnel and service reductions.[189] In the Senate, Biden consistently supported ""a U.S.-led, rules-based international order with an emphasis on reducing trade barriers and setting global trade standards.""[190] He had a mixed record on specific free trade agreements;[191][192] he voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Australia-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, and Morocco–U.S. Free Trade Agreement, but voted against free-trade agreements with Singapore, Chile, Oman, and the Dominican Republic and Central America (CAFTA), viewing their labor and environmental protections as insufficient.[191][192] He voted in favor of fast track trade promotion authority in 1998 and in favor of permanent normal trade relations with China in 2000.[191][192] During the Obama administration, Biden was a strong advocate for the Trans-Pacific Partnership,[193] arguing that the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP ""put China in the driver's seat"" by allowing it to ""write the rules of the road for the world"" in the absence of U.S. participation.[192] Biden has been critical of Chinese trade tactics, including ""dumping"" of steel and Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property.[192] He believes the US, rather than China, should write the rules that govern trade, in which ""workers, the environment, transparency, and middle-class wages"" are protected.[194] He has criticized the Trump trade war with China for failing to ""resolve the issues at the heart of the dispute"";[192] for the trade war's negative effect on U.S. agriculture and manufacturing;[192][195] and for Trump's unilateral approach.[190] Biden also criticized Trump for labeling Canada and the European Union as ""national security threats,""[192] arguing that this undercuts multilateral efforts with allies to combat Chinese trade abuses.[192][190] He supports pressuring China on environmental issues and supports the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.[192] Biden is a staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Obama administration's signature health care reform legislation.[196][197] He has condemned the Trump administration's attempts to strike down the ACA in court,[196] including in California v. Texas.[198] Biden supports the ACA's protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions as well as the ACA's minimum standards for health insurance plans; he has pledged to preserve these protections.[199] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden has promoted a plan to expand and build upon the ACA, paid for by revenue gained from reversing some Trump administration tax cuts.[196] Biden's plan is to create a public option for health insurance, with the aim of expanding health insurance coverage to 97% of Americans.[196] He does not support single-payer health care proposals such as Medicare for All.[200] Under Biden's proposal, ""no one would be required to pay more than 8.5 percent of their income toward health insurance premiums.""[201] Under Biden's plan, all those on the individual insurance market would qualify for tax credits on premiums (a change from existing law, which caps premium tax credits at four times the federal poverty level, or under $50,000 for an independent). To reduce prescription drug prices, Biden proposes allowing import of prescription drugs and authorizing Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices.[196] In April 2020, Biden proposed lowering the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 60.[22][199] Biden supports an end to surprise billing.[199] Biden was given an 85% lifetime approval rating from AFL–CIO.[203] and was a cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act.[204] As stated during his 2020 presidential campaign, the Biden administration intended to fight laws ""that exist only to deprive unions of the financial support they need to fight for higher wages and better benefits""[205] and sought to end or curtail the enforcement of the so-called 2020 Trump Rule which was the Department of Labor's (DOL) heightened oversight of union financial disclosure requirements.[206] The so-called ""Trump Rule"" still exists, the Biden administration announced on March 29 that it will not be enforcing the heightened union reporting requirements to the DOL concerning strike funds, apprenticeship programs, and other union-related “trust fund” information.[207] While he describes himself as pro-labor, Biden has also supported legislation that would impose unpopular contracts on workers, forcing them to work without sick leave and using the Railway Labor Act to prevent workers from striking.[208][209] Worker unions have voted against the proposal, citing quality of life concerns.[210] In particular, it would penalize employees for medical visits, a policy that has been blamed for worker deaths and was a major issue during the COVID-19 pandemic.[211][212] Railroad companies have seen sizeable profits under this policy and have been unwilling to negotiate, praising Biden for his proposed government intervention, which would compel workers to accept their terms.[210][213][214] Biden opposed the George W. Bush administration's tax cuts enacted mostly in 2001 and 2003, noting that most of the benefits of the tax cuts went to the very wealthiest U.S. families, and arguing that the cuts did not help working-class and middle-class Americans.[215] The Obama/Biden administration advocated keeping the cuts in place for 98% of U.S. taxpayers but letting them expire on income over $250,000 earned by couples (or income over $200,000 for individuals).[215] After the Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 election, Biden was designated as the administration's chief negotiator with congressional Republicans—specifically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—regarding the Bush tax cuts, which were about to expire.[216] The administration opposed extending Bush tax cuts for the wealthy but also did not want to trigger tax increases for non-wealthy Americans when the economy was continuing to recover from the Great Recession.[216] The result was a deal: ""Biden and McConnell hashed out a deal that extended all the Bush tax cuts until after the 2012 election, while injecting another $300 billion as an economic stimulus, including a new payroll tax cut for workers, extended unemployment benefits for victims of the recession and expanded tax credits for college students and the poor. By reopening the Senate, the deal also enabled the historic vote to repeal the ban on gay people in the military.""[216] Biden opposes privatizing or means-testing of Social Security.[217] He was given an 89% approval rating from the Alliance for Retired Americans (ARA), reflecting a pro-senior citizen voting record.[218] Biden has called for an expansion of Social Security, including by increasing payments to the oldest Americans (persons who have been receiving retirement benefits for at least 20 years); setting a minimum guaranteed benefit (equal to at least 125% of the federal poverty level) for all Americans with at least 30 years of work; and increasing monthly survivor benefits for widows and widowers by about 20%.[217] Biden has proposed to fund the expansion, and to make the Social Security Trust Fund solvent over the long-term, through tax increases on the highest income-earners.[217] Biden has condemned Trump for waging ""a reckless war on Social Security"" by signing an executive order in 2020 that deferred the collection of the payroll tax that funds Social Security, and for Trump's comments suggesting that he might seek to forgo the tax.[219] Biden said that Trump's move will ""undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.""[219] Biden voted for the 1996 bipartisan welfare reform compromise legislation.[220] Biden pledged a large federal government response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic akin to the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt following the Great Depression.[221] This would include increased COVID-19 testing, ensuring a steady supply of personal protective equipment, distributing a vaccine once available, and securing money from Congress for schools and hospitals under the aegis of a national ""supply chain commander"" who would coordinate the logistics of manufacturing and distributing protective gear and test kits, distributed by a ""Pandemic Testing Board"" (similar to Roosevelt's War Production Board).[221] Biden also pledged to invoke the Defense Production Act more aggressively than Trump in order to build up supplies, as well as the mobilization of up to 100,000 Americans for a ""public health jobs corps"" of contact tracers to help track and prevent outbreaks.[221] Biden has said that ""The United States will always reserve the right to defend itself and its allies, by force, if necessary. But force must be used judiciously to protect a vital interest of the United States, only when the objective is clear and achievable, with the informed consent of the American people, and where required, the approval of Congress.""[222] He has emphasized ""returning the United States to its traditional role as the leader of a world order based on promotion of democracy, multilateralism, alliance-building and diplomatic engagement""[223] and pledged in 2020 that if elected, he would reinvigorate the U.S.'s traditional alliances, including with countries alienated by Trump, and would convene a summit of major heads of state.[224] Biden opposes military action aimed at regime change, but has said that ""it is appropriate for us to provide nonmilitary support for opposition movements seeking universal human rights and more representative and accountable governance.""[222] With respect to humanitarian intervention, Biden has said the U.S. has ""a moral duty, as well as a security interest, to respond to genocide or chemical weapons use"" but that such cases ""require action by the community of nations, not just the United States.""[222] Biden has said that he plans to restore U.S. membership in key United Nations bodies, such as UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),[224] the World Health Organization,[225] and possibly the Human Rights Council.[224] Biden opposed U.S. government funding of abstinence-only sex education programs in Africa, and in 2007, cosponsored the HIV Prevention Act which would end President George W. Bush's mandate that one-third of all funds be earmarked to abstinence-only programs.[226] Biden favors greater U.S. engagement with Africa to counter growing Chinese influence on the continent.[224] In 2011, during the Obama administration's internal debate on the Libyan Civil War, Biden opposed the U.S. intervention.[227][228] Biden stated he was ""strongly against going to Libya"" due to the instability it would cause after Muammar Gaddafi was deposed, recounting to Charlie Rose later: ""My question was, 'OK, tell me what happens.' He's gone. What happens? Doesn't the country disintegrate? What happens then? Doesn't it become a place where it becomes a petri dish for the growth of extremism? And it has.""[229] Biden publicly defended the Obama administration's ultimate decision to participate in the Libya intervention, saying in 2011, ""NATO got it right. In this case, America spent $2 billion and didn't lose a single life. This is more the prescription for how to deal with the world as we go forward than it has in the past.""[230] Biden favored an American deployment of troops to Darfur during the war in Darfur, saying that 2,500 U.S. troops could stop the violence in the region.[226] As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden has been a prominent voice calling for ""hard-headed diplomacy"" with Iran. He also has called for the implementation of ""coordinated international sanctions"" on Iran, adding ""we should complement this pressure by presenting a detailed, positive vision for U.S.–Iran relations if Iran does the right thing.""[226] In 2007, Biden voted against a measure to declare the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. He wrote in December 2007 that ""War with Iran is not just a bad option. It would be a disaster."" Biden threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Bush if he had started a war with Iran without Congressional approval.[226] In an interview in September 2008, Biden stated that the IRGC was a terrorist organization and that the Bush administration already had the power to designate it as one. He stated that he voted against the measure out of concern that the Bush administration would misuse the measure to justify a military attack against Iran.[231] As vice president, Biden vigorously defended the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the nuclear agreement negotiated by the Obama administration between Iran and the U.S. and other global powers.[232] Biden has criticized Trump's withdrawal from the agreement and the Trump administration's Iran strategy as ""a self-inflicted disaster,"" saying in 2019 that Iran had ""only gotten more aggressive"" since Trump ""unilaterally withdrew from the hard-won nuclear agreement that the Obama-Biden Administration negotiated.""[233] Biden said, ""I have no illusions about Iran. The regime has long sponsored terrorism and threatened our interests. It continues to detain American citizens. They've ruthlessly killed hundreds of protesters, and they should be held accountable for their actions. But there is a smart way to counter them, and a self-defeating way. Trump's approach is demonstrably the latter. The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy – clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upsmanship.""[234] If elected president, Biden said he would reenter and strengthen the nuclear agreement once Iran is in compliance.[235] In 1990, after Iraq under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Biden voted against the first Gulf War, asking: ""What vital interests of the United States justify sending Americans to their deaths in the sands of Saudi Arabia?""[236] In 1998, Biden expressed support for the use of force against Iraq and urged a sustained effort to ""dethrone"" Hussein over the long haul.[237] In 2002, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he stated that Hussein was ""a long-term threat and a short term threat to our national security"" and that ""We have no choice but to eliminate the threat. This is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world. He must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power.""[238] Biden also supported a failed resolution authorizing military action in Iraq only after the exhaustion of diplomatic efforts.[239] Biden subsequently voted in favor of the 2002 resolution that authorized the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying, ""I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations. Because while Iraq's illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not – do not – pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.""[240] During the Iraq War, Biden consistently criticized the George W. Bush administration for ""its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq.""[240] He criticized Bush in March and April 2003 for failing to make robust diplomatic efforts to avert war but said at the time that it was ""the right decision"" to ""separate him (Hussein) from his weapons and/or separate him from power.""[240] In an interview of Meet the Press in November 2005, Biden said of his 2002 vote to authorize the use of force: ""It was a mistake. It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. ... We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan.""[240] In 2007, Biden strongly opposed Bush's ""troop surge"" in Iraq, calling it a ""tragic mistake.""[241] He promoted legislation to repeal and replace the 2002 resolution that authorized the war, arguing that it was no longer necessary because Hussein had been removed for power and executed, and because no weapons of mass destruction were ever found in Iraq.[241] The replacement resolution favored by Biden would provide that U.S. troops could combat terrorism and train Iraqi forces, but begin a ""responsible drawdown"" of U.S. troops that would end in the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.[241] In May 2006, in an op-ed in The New York Times, Biden and Leslie H. Gelb, the president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations, proposed a plan for a decentralized, federal Iraq, with a relatively weak central government with strong Sunni, Shiite, and Kurdish regional administrations that would govern largely autonomously within their own regions.[241][242][243][244] Under the plan, there would not have been a partition of the country,[243] but the central government would have its responsibilities limited to areas of common concern, such as ""border defense, foreign policy, and oil production and revenue sharing.""[242] The goal of the plan was to halt the high level of sectarian violence in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds.[241][242][243] Biden likened the plan to the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which led to an end to the Bosnian War.[242][244] The plan received a mixed reception.[242] A non-binding ""sense of the Senate"" resolution in support of the plan, sponsored by Biden and Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas), passed the Senate in a September 2007 on a 75–23 vote.[242][243] However, the proposal was opposed by Bush administration and many Iraqi political parties, including the United Iraqi Alliance of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.[242] The autonomy/federalism proposal was broadly unpopular among Iraqi Arabs, both Sunni and Shia,[245][242][246] but was welcomed by Iraqi Kurds and the Kurdistan Regional Government,[245] as well as by Iraq President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd and proponent of Iraqi federalism.[242] In a 2016 interview with Council on Foreign Relations president Richard N. Haass, Biden spoke about changing ""the fundamental approach [America] had to the Middle East"", and that the lesson learned from Iraq is ""the use of force with large standing armies in place was extremely costly, [and] would work until the moment we left.""[247] In the Senate, Biden developed lifelong relationships with Israeli officials through his work on the Foreign Relations Committee,[248] beginning with Golda Meir in 1973.[249][248][250] Biden called his meeting with Meir as a young senator on the eve of the Yom Kippur War ""one of the most consequential meetings I've ever had in my life.""[251] He has regularly described himself as a Zionist,[226][249] and is a longtime supporter of Israel, which Biden considers to be a key U.S. strategic ally in the Middle East.[249][252] On the Senate floor in 1986 he defended US funding of Israel referring to it as ""the best $3 billion investment we make"" and declared that ""were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region"".[253][254] When Biden was selected by Obama as a running mate, National Jewish Democratic Council chairman Ira Forman praised the choice, saying, ""There is no one you could possibly pick who knows the issues, who is committed to Israel's security and knows Israeli leaders, as much as Joe Biden.""[255] During the 2008 presidential campaign, Biden stressed in a Florida campaign event that he and his running mate Obama were both strongly pro-Israel and would make Israel more secure.[250][256][257] Biden also said: ""A strong America is a strong Israel. I have a 35-year record of supporting Israel, and Israel's security is enhanced the stronger America is.""[258] In the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated ""no one in the United States Senate has been a better friend to Israel than Joe Biden. I would have never, ever joined this ticket were I not absolutely sure Barack Obama shared my passion.""[259] In 2008, Biden criticized the George W. Bush administration and John McCain, arguing: ""By any empirical standard, Israel is less secure today than it was when George Bush became president. He has made one foul-up after another that John has supported.""[250][256] Biden called for a proactive US role in the Israel-Palestinian peace process,[252] which he argued would be advanced if the U.S. took steps to ""regain the respect of the world.""[258] He called for increased engagement with Syria over the Golan Heights dispute, the disarmament of Hezbollah, and Syrian influence in Lebanon.[252] In 2008, discussing the possibility of Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Biden said it was ""not a question for us to tell the Israelis what they can and cannot do"" but that he had ""faith in the democracy of Israel"" and supported additional diplomatic efforts to avert military conflict.[231] In April 2009, Biden again said that Israel would not launch a unilateral strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, stating: ""I think [Israel] would be ill-advised to do that. And so my level of concern is no different than it was a year ago.""[260] Throughout his career, Biden has had a strong relationship with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), speaking at the group's events and fundraisers;[251] Biden and AIPAC have mutually praised each other.[261] Nevertheless, Biden has not always agreed with the group's stances, saying in 2008 that ""AIPAC does not speak for the entire American Jewish community. There's other organizations as strong and as consequential"" and adding ""I've never disagreed with AIPAC on the objective. Whenever I've had disagreement with AIPAC it has always been a tactical disagreement, not a substantive disagreement.""[262] Biden strongly opposed granting executive clemency to Jonathan Pollard, who was convicted of spying for Israel, saying ""If it were up to me, he would stay in jail for life.""[248][263] Biden praised the United Arab Emirates's offer to recognize Israel in a August 2020 normalization agreement, calling the agreement ""a welcome, brave, and badly-needed act of statesmanship.""[264][265] In an effort to reduce the rise of Anti Semitism in the United States, the Biden administration launched[266] the first ever national strategy to combat Anti Semitism on May 25, 2023. Biden has consistently supported a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying it is (1) ""the only path to long-term security for Israel, while sustaining its identity as a Jewish and democratic state""; (2) ""the only way to ensure Palestinian dignity and their legitimate interest in national self-determination""; and (3) ""a necessary condition to take full advantage of the opening that exists for greater cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors.""[251] He cosponsored the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 which expressed U.S. support for a two-state solution.[226][267] In a 2007 interview, when asked about the failure to achieve Israeli-Palestinians peace, Biden stated that ""Israel's a democracy and they make mistakes. But the notion that somehow if Israel just did the right thing, [the peace process] would work ... give me a break."" He also stated that ""The responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of Israel to exist, will not play fair, will not deal, will not renounce terror.""[255] During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Biden stated that the Bush administration's policy concerning the Middle East had been ""an abject failure"" and pledged that, if elected, he and Barack Obama would ""change this policy with thoughtful, real, live diplomacy that understands that you must back Israel in letting them negotiate, support their negotiation, and stand with them, not insist on policies like this administration has.""[259] In a 2010 speech to the Jewish Federations of North America, Biden said ""There is no substitute for direct face-to-face negotiations leading eventually to states for two people secured – the Jewish State of Israel and the viable independent state of Palestine. That is the only path to the Israeli people's decades-long quest for security, and the only path to the Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for nationhood.""[268] Speaking in 2019, Biden said, ""At the present, neither the Israeli nor Palestinian leadership seems willing to take the political risks necessary to make progress through direct negotiations,"" and said that if elected president, he would be focusing on urging ""both sides to take steps to keep the prospect of a two-state outcome alive.""[251] Following Trump's controversial move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, Biden said he would not return the embassy to Tel Aviv if elected president, but that he would re-open the U.S. consulate in East Jerusalem for outreach to Palestinians.[251] Biden reaffirmed his support for a two-state solution during his presidency, noting it in an April 2021 telephone call with King Abdullah II of Jordan.[269] Biden has consistently criticized Israeli settlement policy.[251] In a 2009 speech at the AIPAC conference, Biden called upon Israel ""to work towards a two-state solution"" by dismantling existing Israeli settlements, halting new settlement construction, and allowing Palestinians freedom of movement, and called on the Palestinians to ""combat terror and incitement against Israel.""[270] In a 2016 speech to J Street, Biden said that he had ""overwhelming frustration"" with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the government's promotion and expansion of settlements, legalization of outposts, and land seizures. Noting that he had opposed Israeli settlements for more than three decades, Biden said they are counterproductive to Israel's security. In the same speech, Biden criticized Palestinian terrorist attacks and Palestinian recourse to the International Criminal Court, which he called ""damaging moves that only take us further from the path toward peace,"" and called out President Mahmoud Abbas for failing to condemn terrorist attacks. Regarding a multi-billion dollar defense deal that the U.S. was negotiating with Israel, Biden said ""Israel will not get everything it asks for, but it will get every single solitary thing it needs,"" and said: ""No matter what political disagreements we have with Israel – and we do have political disagreements now – there is never any question about our commitment to Israel's security.""[271][272] In a subsequent speech in December 2019, Biden criticized Netanyahu for his drift to ""the extreme right in his party,"" calling this move a bid to retain political power and a ""serious mistake.""[273] Biden criticized Israel's plan to annex parts of Palestinian territory in the West Bank.[274] In June 2020, Biden's foreign policy advisor Tony Blinken said that Biden ""would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree."" Biden said that if elected president he will firmly reject the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign ""which singles out Israel and too often veers into antisemitism – and fight other efforts to delegitimize Israel on the global stage.""[275] Biden has called Saudi Arabia a pariah state.[276][277] Biden criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen,[195] accusing Saudi Arabia of killing ""innocent people"" in that war.[276] He said that if elected president, he would end US involvement in that war and re-assess Saudi Arabia-United States relations. He criticized the Trump administration's sale of arms to Saudi Arabia.[195] Saudi Arabia reportedly took more than 24 hours to congratulate Joe Biden on his November 3, 2020, Presidential election victory. Biden demanded more accountability over Jamal Khashoggi's murder from Saudi Arabia during his campaigns. The elections saw the defeat of Donald Trump who had close personal ties with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.[278] In a 2018 conversation for Foreign Affairs, Biden described Syria as ""a classic example of the biggest conundrum that we have to deal with."" He sees America's current situation in Syria as having ""lost the notion among our European friends that we know what we're doing, that we have a plan."" He emphasized the necessity of stabilizing Syria, especially in major cities like Raqqa.[279] Raqqa is in ruins after lengthy battles between ISIL and Kurdish forces, the SDF, with assistance from the U.S.-led coalition.[280] Biden said a multi-billion dollar investment is required to rebuild the city. He believes Iran, not Russia, will be the biggest beneficiaries in the short term if Syria remains a battlefield. President Bashar al-Assad will also need to be removed from power, otherwise Syria will never have peace or security.[279] Biden said there is no uniting principle in Syria, unlike Iraq, hence only certain safe harbors can be established in the region to reduce the number of displaced people and deaths.[279] In 2014, Biden said that Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had ""poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al-Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.""[281] Shortly afterward, Biden later apologized to the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan over comments that Turkey supported jihadist rebels in Syria.[282] However, Biden has remained strongly critical of Erdoğan; in December 2019, Biden referred to Erdoğan as an ""autocrat"" and criticized his treatment of the Kurds in Turkey, Turkish military links with Russia (including Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense equipment), and the Turkish government's threats to limit access to U.S. airfields in Turkey.[283][284] Biden has long been a supporter of the rights of the Kurds.[245][285] In 2020, Biden told Kurdistan 24, ""Masoud Barzani is a good friend of mine, and I wished we could have done more for the Kurds."" When asked why he could not, Biden said: ""Turkey.""[245] Biden has criticized the Kurdish separatist organization PKK; in 2016, he said the PKK was a terrorist group ""plain and simple"" and compared it to ISIL.[286] Also in 2016, Biden warned Kurds against seeking a separate state on the Turkish-Syrian border.[287] In 2016, Biden condemned the coup attempt in Turkey,[287] but also criticized the Turkish government's subsequent campaign of repression against journalists, political dissidents, and academics, and violations of freedom of speech.[288][289] Biden also rebuffed attempts by Erdoğan and the Turkish government to pressure the U.S. to extradite dissident cleric Fethullah Gulen to Turkey, noting that under U.S. law, the matter was for the legal system and federal courts to decide, and the Obama administration had no proper role. (The Turkish government has clashed with Gulen, accusing him of orchestrating the coup attempt; Gulen denies the allegation).[290][291][292] In September 2020, Biden demanded that Turkey ""stay out"" of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, in which Turkey has supported the Azeris.[293][294] Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, ""Whatever it takes, we should do it.""[295] In 2008, Pakistan awarded the Hilal-e-Pakistan (Crescent of Pakistan) to Joe Biden and Senator Richard Lugar ""in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan"".[296] This was after Biden passed a bill authorizing $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.[297] In a 2008 interview, Biden criticized Bush for presenting Iraq as the primary front against terrorism, saying the U.S. should ""urgently shift our focus"" from Iraq to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, which Biden described as ""the real central front on the so-called war on terrorism,"" noting that ""The Afghanistan-Pakistan border is where the 9/11 attacks were plotted... It's where most attacks on Europe since 9/11 have originated. It's where Osama bin Laden lives and his top confederates still enjoy safe haven, planning new attacks.[298] Biden said that ""the outcome of that battle is going to be determined less by bullets than by dollars and determination"" and that the U.S.'s ""original sin was starting a war of choice [the intervention in Iraq] before we finished a war of necessity [the war in Afghanistan].""[298] During the Obama administration's internal debates, Biden argued strongly against the 2009 surge of troops to Afghanistan, putting him on the opposite side of Defense Secretary Robert Gates.[228][299] Biden argued that rampant corruption and ineffectiveness in the Afghan government, military, and police made the U.S. strategy unworkable, and was ""agnostic"" about the survival of the Kabul-based government.[299] In 2012, speaking to West Point graduates, Biden argued that the Obama administration's drawdown of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq allowed the U.S. ""enabled us to replace and rebalance our foreign policy"" to focus on other challenges.[300] In 2020, during his presidential campaign, Biden pledges to bring home the remaining U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan during his first term in office, and that ""any residual U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be focused only on counterterrorism operations.""[301] With respect to Asia, Biden favors restoring the ""traditional U.S. stance supporting the presence of American troops in Japan and South Korea.""[224] In 2016, Biden described the Trans-Pacific Partnership as an agreement that was as much about geopolitics as economics. Being part of the Obama administration, he supported the agreement in an attempt to ""rebalance towards Asia"" against a stronger and bolder Chinese foreign policy in the region.[247] Biden first visited China in April 1979, where met with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on the first U.S. congressional delegation to China since the 1949 revolution.[302] In 2000, he voted in favor of normalizing trade relations with China and supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization.[302] Over the years, Biden has frequently criticized the Chinese government for its human rights abuses, while also acknowledging the need to gain Chinese cooperation on issues such as climate change, Iran and North Korea.[302] Biden was outraged by the Chinese government's violent repression of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and in the Senate introduced legislation to create the democracy-promoting Radio Free Asia, which opened in 1996 and continues to operate.[302] In June 2019, Biden wrote, ""China's continuing oppression of its own people, especially the abuse and internment of more than one million Uyghurs, is one of the worst human rights crises in the world today. It can't be ignored.""[195] Biden termed the Chinese actions against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province a genocide.[302] Also in 2020, Biden expressed support for Hong Kong's protests.[303] In 2018, Biden said he had spent more time in private meetings with Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping than any other world leader.[279] He has criticized Xi as ""a guy who doesn't have a democratic – with a small d – bone in his body. This is a guy who is a thug.""[304][305] Biden pledged, if elected, to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[302] In 2019, Biden said that China is ""not competition"" for the United States, drawing criticism from prominent members of both parties.[306] In 2021, Biden called China America's ""most serious competitor"".[307] On February 10, Biden spoke to Xi for the first time after taking office as U.S. president and told a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, ""If we don't get moving, they are going to eat our lunch.""[308] Biden was accused of giving a ""shameful"" answer when asked about Uyghur genocide in a CNN town hall in 2021, claiming it was a result of ""different cultural norms"".[309] Speaking in 2006, Biden described North Korea as a ""paper tiger"" that lacked the capacity to directly cause harm to America, but condemned North Korean nuclear testing as a ""deliberate and dangerous provocation.""[226] He proposed a requirement, included in the 2007 national defense authorization act, for the Bush administration to appoint a special coordinator on North Korea, and described Korean Peninsula tensions as one of ""the three most important things that the next president is going to have to deal with"" (along with policy on Iraq and Iran).[226] As vice president, Biden visited South Korean President Park Geun-hye and visited the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In a 2013 speech in Seoul, Biden said: ""The United States and the world have to make it absolutely clear to Kim Jong-un that the international community will not accept or tolerate nuclear arms in North Korea. The simple fact is this—North Korea can never achieve security and prosperity so long as it pursues nuclear weapons, period. We are prepared to go back to the six-party talks when North Korea demonstrates its full commitment to a complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.""[310] Biden has criticized Trump's warm personal relations with Kim as ""antithetical to who we are,"" saying, ""Are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Kim Jong-un?""[311] Biden also criticized Trump for engaging in ""three made-for-TV summits"" that have led to no ""concrete commitment from North Korea.""[312] Biden has pledged, if elected president, to discontinue Trump's direct personal diplomacy with Kim[313] and engage in a ""sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others"" to pressure North Korea toward denuclearization.""[312] North Korean state media attacked Biden in 2019 as ""an imbecile""; a spokesman for Biden's campaign responded: ""Trump has also been repeatedly tricked into making major concessions to the murderous regime in Pyongyang while getting nothing in return. Given Vice President Biden's record of standing up for American values and interests, it's no surprise that North Korea would prefer that Donald Trump remain in the White House.""[311] In May 2021, President Biden expressed his and South Korea's commitment to ""the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula...[and addressing North Korea's] nuclear and ballistic missile programs.""[314] In the 1990s, Biden was involved in efforts to stop the Bosnian genocide by Bosnian Serb forces.[315] He supported the ""lift and strike"" policy of lifting the arms embargo, training Bosnian Muslims and supporting them with NATO air strikes, and investigating war crimes.[316][317] Biden supported sending in the American airforce to blow up ""all of the bridges on the Drina"" and to take out their oil supplies.[318] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his ""proudest moment in public life"" related to foreign policy.[319] During the Kosovo War (1999), Biden supported US military intervention against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).[316] He was strongly critical of Serbia, saying that Serbs are ""illiterates, degenerates, baby killers and rapists"".[320] He co-sponsored a resolution with John McCain for use of force by the US to halt Yugoslav military actions toward Kosovo Albanians.[315][319][321] Biden has pressed Serbia over the issue of missing persons and war crimes.[315] He supports the independence of Kosovo and considers it ""irreversible"".[322] In 2010 he referred to the Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Thaci as ""the George Washington of Kosovo"".[323] According to Biden, he was one of ""only three people in Washington"" who thought that the US troops ""should go straight to Belgrade and arrest Milosevic"" even at the cost of American lives:[324] ""We should announce there's going to be American casualties. We should go to Belgrade, and we should have a Japanese-German style occupation of that country."" In his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden supports an agreement of mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia, and for Kosovo to attain EU visa liberalisation.[315] He also supports Albania's territorial security and its reform agenda aimed toward becoming a future EU member.[315] Biden supports Bosnian territorial integrity and sovereignty, its multi-ethnic society and future membership in NATO and the EU.[315] During his campaign for the presidency, Biden has called for restoring friendly U.S. relationship with fellow NATO member states, which have been strained by insults and antagonism from Trump,[224] as well as by criticism by Trump of NATO and other multilateral alliances.[325] Biden criticized Trump's decision to withdraw 9,500 U.S. troops stationed in Germany.[326] Biden has criticized Trump for treating NATO as ""a protection racket"" rather than ""the most significant military alliance in the history of the world"" and Biden advisors have identified a strengthened NATO as a key component of countering a rising China.[326] According to European diplomats and trade experts, a Biden presidency would likely lead to a boost in the U.S.-British ""special relationship""; repair alliances broken during the Trump administration; and enhance the likelihood of a trans-Atlantic trade agreement.[325] Biden is a staunch supporter of the European Union (EU).[327] Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election caused consternation among some in the unionist community due to comments made in the past indicating apparent sympathies to Irish republicanism.[328] DUP representatives in particular criticized a joking comments made by Vice-President Biden on St Patrick's Day 2015 to the Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny; ""anyone wearing orange is not welcome in here"".[328][329][330] The color orange in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is associated with the Orange Order and Protestantism more generally.[329][330] Regarding Brexit, Biden in 2020 warned the British government not to jeopardize peace in Northern Ireland by negating the rules and regulations of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, and has said that ""Any trade deal between the US and UK must be contingent upon respect for the agreement and preventing the return of a hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.[331][332] Speaking in 2020, former U.S. Ambassador to the EU Anthony L. Gardner said that ""Joe Biden believes that the triangle of relationships, US–UK, UK–EU, US and EU, all have to work together, and you will see statements to that effect.""[332] Biden condemned ""LGBT-free zones"" in Poland, saying they ""have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world.""[333] In 1999, Biden cosponsored a draft resolution condemning Russia's military campaign to crush the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the use of indiscriminate force by the Russian army against civilians and violations of the Geneva Convention, and urged a peaceful resolution of the conflict.[334][335] In 2005, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution criticizing Russia for failing to uphold its commitments at the 1999 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Summit, which included agreements on a completed Russian military withdrawal from Moldova's breakaway, pro-Russian region of Transnistria. That resolution also expressed disapproval of Russia's demand for the closure of the OSCE Border Monitoring Operation (BMO), which served to observe border crossings between Georgia and the Russian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia. That bill passed in the Senate.[226] Biden introduced legislation in July 2008 urging members of the Group of Eight to ""work toward a more constructive relationship with Russia"", and encouraging Russia to behave according to the G-8's ""objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, and democracy."" The resolution also called on Russian and U.S. leaders to increase cooperation and funding for the Nunn-Lugar program and other nonproliferation initiatives. It also emphasized the need for a successor to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Treaty. The resolution passed.[226] Biden has voiced concerns about Russia backsliding on democratic reforms. In August 2008, Biden criticized Russia's military action in Georgia in support of South Ossetian separatists. ""By acting disproportionately with a full-scale attack on Georgia and seeking the ouster of Georgia's democratically elected President Mikheil Saakashvili, Moscow is jeopardizing its standing in Europe and the broader international community – and risking very real practical and political consequences"", Biden wrote in a Financial Times op-ed. Biden urged Russia to abide by the negotiated cease-fire.[226] Through 2020, Biden and Putin had met once, in Moscow in March 2011. After an official group meeting Biden characterized in his memoir as ""argumentative,"" he and Putin met privately, with Biden saying ""Mr. Prime Minister, I'm looking into your eyes,"" (a reference to a 2001 meeting between Putin and President Bush, who later said ""I looked the man in the eye...I was able to get a sense of his soul""). Biden continued, ""I don't think you have a soul."" Putin replied, ""We understand each other.""[336] In a 2018 Foreign Affairs op-ed co-written with Michael Carpenter, Biden described Russia as a kleptocratic, nationalist-populist state that considers Western democracy its existential threat. He acknowledged that the Kremlin launched coordinated attacks across many domains – military, political, economic, informational – against various Western democratic countries, including cyberattacks on the 2016 United States presidential election and 2017 French presidential election. As a result of Russia's threat, Biden supports a ""strong response"" with cooperation from America's allies and campaign finance reform that will prohibit foreign donations from flowing into domestic elections.[337] Blockquote|text=Western democracies must also address glaring vulnerabilities in their electoral systems, financial sectors, cyber-infrastructure, and media ecosystems. The U.S. campaign finance system, for example, needs to be reformed to deny foreign actors – from Russia and elsewhere – the ability to interfere in American elections. Authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the secretive bundling of donations that allows foreign money to flow to U.S. organizations (such as “ghost corporations”) that in turn contribute to super PACs and other putatively independent political organizations, such as trade associations and so-called 501(c)(4) groups. Congress must get serious about campaign finance reform now; doing so should be a matter of bipartisan consensus since this vulnerability affects Democrats and Republicans in equal measure.|sign=Joe Biden, Michael Carpenter|source=""How to Stand Up to the Kremlin"" He also condemned Trump for equivocating ""on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election, even after he received briefings from top intelligence officials on precisely how Moscow did it.""[338] At the 2019 Munich Security Conference, Biden reiterated his opposition to Russian interference in elections and their actions against European neighbors, saying, ""We have to be explicit in our response and make clear to Russia that there's a price to pay for these transgressions of international norms"", and that the U.S. needs to continue to support its NATO allies, as well as Georgia and Ukraine who are not part of NATO, by ""establishing virtually continuous air, land and sea presence on NATO's eastern perimeter."" He also expressed concerns about Russian influence operations targeting American politics.[339] On 19 January 2022, President Biden said that he believed Russia would invade Ukraine.[340] Biden said a full-scale invasion of Ukraine would be ""the most consequential thing that's happened in the world in terms of war and peace"" since World War Two.[341] In January 2022, the Biden administration approved deliveries of U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine.[342] President Biden was considering deploying up to 50,000 U.S. troops to Eastern Europe.[343] White House National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horne said that ""President Biden said that there is a distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February [2022]""[344] Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky disagreed on how imminent the threat was.[345][346] After Russia invaded Ukraine he imposed sanctions on Russia and authorized foreign aid and weapons shipments to Ukraine.[347][348] As part of the Obama Administration, Biden supported the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to combat drug cartels and strengthen law enforcement in Central America. Between 2008 and 2011, the Department of State provided $361.5 million to Central American countries. The State Department stated five main goals to CARSI: When Biden met with Central American leaders in Honduras in 2012, he reiterated the Obama Administration's pledge of $107 million in aid for the region. The Administration would work with Congress to provide the funds under CARSI. These initiatives were part of a larger effort for institutional reform in the region to counter drug trafficking.[350][351] During the 2014 Central American child-migrant crisis, Biden supported a $1 billion economic aid package to affected Central American countries. In an op-ed for The New York Times, he wrote, ""the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.""[352] He also supported further institutional reforms to combat corruption in those countries, so they can provide their people with safer living conditions.[353] While in the Senate, Biden voted for the Helms-Burton Act and supported the U.S. embargo against Cuba; in 2006, Biden called for the U.S. to be ""putting together a plan as to how we are going to play a positive role in moving that country, after the Castros are gone ... more toward democratization and liberalization.""[226][354] As vice president, Biden supported Obama's Cuban thaw and reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.[355] Biden stated that the lifting of U.S. trade and travel restrictions removed an ""ineffective stumbling block to our bilateral relations with other nations in the hemisphere"" and made it easier for the U.S. to engage on issues around human rights.[355] Biden has criticized Trump's moves to roll back the détente between the U.S. and Cuba, writing in an op-ed in Americas Quarterly that Trump's resumptions of restrictions on travel and commerce harm Cubans seeking ""greater independence from the Communist state"" and alienate Western Hemisphere allies.[356] Biden also wrote in the Miami Herald that ""Trump's...callously limiting the ability of Cuban Americans to reunite with and support their families in Cuba, and the administration's Latin America policy, at best, is a Cold War-era retread and, at worst, at worst, an ineffective mess.""[357] During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden pledged to restore Obama-era U.S. relations with Cuba.[224][358] Asked about the 2021 Cuban protests, Biden criticized the ""failed state"" of Cuba for repressing its citizens and referred to communism, which Cuba follows, as ""a universally failed system.""

,Nevada primary: Biden focuses on Black and Latino voters as GOP scheme helps Trump,"Election day off to a quiet start with no major candidates in the state and with voters slow to trickle into polling sites Polls have closed in Nevada, which is holding its first presidential primary contest in the US west, has been damp – and oddly quiet. None of the major candidates are in the state, and voters have been slow to trickle into polling sites. Only about 12,000 people had opted to vote at polling stations on election day. About 151,000 people voted early, the majority of them by mail. Both Democrats and Republicans are holding presidential primaries, but the Republican competition will hold little meaning. The state’s GOP, which is led by a recently indicted fake Trump elector, will be allocating its delegates based on a separate caucus it is holding on Thursday, in which Donald Trump is the only major contender. Nikki Haley, who is running in the Republican primary but not in the caucus, is expected to grab a symbolic victory in the primaries, which her party is begrudgingly holding to comply with a state mandate. The two-track nomination scheme has been widely criticised as a confusing and cynical scheme to benefit the former president. The confusing calendar, as well as the seeming inevitability of Joe Biden and Trump as the eventual nominees, has resulted in a subdued election day. It does not help that an atmospheric river storm is passing through, drenching what is typically the nation’s driest state. The election is a testament to the importance of having a mail-in voting option, said Cisco Aguilar, the Nevada secretary of state. “We are a working community, we’re a 24/7 economy and people need efficiency when they’re working,” he said. “And so they can get that efficiency through a primary process.” As a voters shuffled into the city hall polling location in Henderson, Nevada, Molly the therapy dog was there to help voters with election day stress. Most voters in the afternoon had already filled out their ballots, and were just stopping by to drop them off. Marla Duncan, 68, said she had texted a number of friends and family to remind them that Tuesday was election day, and posted about the primaries on her Instagram. She’s not worried about her age group turning out, she said, but she does worry that younger voters – many of whom have been disillusioned by politics – will stay home for the primary, and in November during the general election. “Right now, I think that Biden is probably the strongest choice for what we need,” she said. “I don’t know if I even want to talk about the other candidate, who wants to be a dictator,” she added, referring to Trump’s aside last year that he would be a dictator on “day one” if elected. While he is certain to win it, the Democratic primary will still be a test for Biden, who has been working to shore up the support of Black and Latino voters in this key swing state. In the last two elections, Nevada’s Latino voters, who make up about 20% of the electorate, played a decisive role and helped Democrats win with thin margins. This year, despite the support of the state’s powerful Culinary Workers Union, which represents tens of thousands of hospitality and casino workers in Las Vegas and beyond, the US president will have to drum up enthusiasm among working-class voters of color. “It always has been, but this year it really is like voting for the lesser evil,” said Liz Galvez, 27, who voted for Gabriel Cornejo, a Las Vegas-based entrepreneur running in the Democratic primary. Galvez said she had been disheartened by the administration’s support for Israel amid its bombardment of Gaza. “Its awful,” she said. “As a citizen I am funding genocide.” In November, she expects she will vote for Biden – but begrudgingly. “I don’t want Trump in office again,” she said. “As a woman that was hard. As a queer person it was hard. He drummed up hate.” During a campaign rally on Sunday, Biden himself framed himself as a foil to Trump, warning of the threat the former president poses to democratic norms. But Biden acknowledged that voters might be weary. “I know, we know, we have a lot more to do,” he said. “Not everyone is feeling the benefits of our investments and progress yet. But inflation is now lower in America than in any other major economy in the world.” Despite high unemployment rates, voters have been feeling the pinch of rising costs, and the majority of Latino voters in the state named economic concerns as a top issue. Sign up to First Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters  Biden met with Culinary Union members on Monday. “I came to say thank you. Not just to say thank you for the support that you’ve given me last time out, but to thank you for having the faith in the union,” he told them. But amid protracted negotiations with Las Vegas’s resorts and casinos, and the Super Bowl coming up this weekend, organizers have been focused on campaigns for fair wages and benefits for workers ahead of the biggest sports event of the year. “There will be plenty of time to talk about politics,” said D Taylor, president of the Unite Here union, at a press conference on Tuesday morning – noting that the unions’ first priority now was making sure these workers at the Allegiant Stadium, which will host the Super Bowl this weekend, have the right to organize and can earn fair wages. Biden could be bolstered by encouraging economic numbers in January, when average hourly earnings rose 0.6% and unemployment remained low. Turnout in the primaries is expected to be low, especially given that the races are not competitive. Local advocacy groups – both partisan and non-partisan – are planning to ramp up canvassing efforts later in the spring and summer. A pro-Biden Super Pac also recently reserved a record $250m in advertising across seven battleground states, including Nevada, with an eye on mobilising disaffected younger voters and Latino and Black voters. Leo Murrieta, the director of Make the Road Action in Nevada, said he was skeptical of polls and analysis indicating that Republicans had made gains among Latino voters. “The narrative that brown voters are defecting to the Republican side, that’s not true,” he said. “They’re not defecting – they are just going home. Our job is to go to their homes and pull them out to vote.” Linda Hunt, who has been a member of the Culinary Union for 45 years, voted early in the Democratic primary for Biden. “He’s the most pro-union president I’ve ever seen,” she said. “He’s for the workers.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/06/nevada-primary-biden-trump-republicans-democrats,
,The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election,"A weird thing happened right after the Nov. 3 election: nothing. The nation was braced for chaos. Liberal groups had vowed to take to the streets, planning hundreds of protests across the country. Right-wing militias were girding for battle. In a poll before Election Day, 75% of Americans voiced concern about violence.    Instead, an eerie quiet descended. As President Trump refused to concede, the response was not mass action but crickets. When media organizations called the race for Joe Biden on Nov. 7, jubilation broke out instead, as people thronged cities across the U.S. to celebrate the democratic process that resulted in Trump’s ouster. A second odd thing happened amid Trump’s attempts to reverse the result: corporate America turned on him. Hundreds of major business leaders, many of whom had backed Trump’s candidacy and supported his policies, called on him to concede. To the President, something felt amiss. “It was all very, very strange,” Trump said on Dec. 2. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even while many key states were still being counted.” In a way, Trump was right. There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes, one that both curtailed the protests and coordinated the resistance from CEOs. Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans. The pact was formalized in a terse, little-noticed joint statement of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO published on Election Day. Both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain–inspired by the summer’s massive, sometimes destructive racial-justice protests–in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump’s assault on democracy. The handshake between business and labor was just one component of a vast, cross-partisan campaign to protect the election–an extraordinary shadow effort dedicated not to winning the vote but to ensuring it would be free and fair, credible and uncorrupted. For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America’s institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from a remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined President. Though much of this activity took place on the left, it was separate from the Biden campaign and crossed ideological lines, with crucial contributions by nonpartisan and conservative actors. The scenario the shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a Trump victory. It was an election so calamitous that no result could be discerned at all, a failure of the central act of democratic self-governance that has been a hallmark of America since its founding. Their work touched every aspect of the election. They got states to change voting systems and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding. They fended off voter-suppression lawsuits, recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time. They successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and used data-driven strategies to fight viral smears. They executed national public-awareness campaigns that helped Americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks, preventing Trump’s conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction. After Election Day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the result. “The untold story of the election is the thousands of people of both parties who accomplished the triumph of American democracy at its very foundation,” says Norm Eisen, a prominent lawyer and former Obama Administration official who recruited Republicans and Democrats to the board of the Voter Protection Program. For Trump and his allies were running their own campaign to spoil the election. The President spent months insisting that mail ballots were a Democratic plot and the election would be “rigged.” His henchmen at the state level sought to block their use, while his lawyers brought dozens of spurious suits to make it more difficult to vote–an intensification of the GOP’s legacy of suppressive tactics. Before the election, Trump plotted to block a legitimate vote count. And he spent the months following Nov. 3 trying to steal the election he’d lost–with lawsuits and conspiracy theories, pressure on state and local officials, and finally summoning his army of supporters to the Jan. 6 rally that ended in deadly violence at the Capitol. The democracy campaigners watched with alarm. “Every week, we felt like we were in a struggle to try to pull off this election without the country going through a real dangerous moment of unraveling,” says former GOP Representative Zach Wamp, a Trump supporter who helped coordinate a bipartisan election-protection council. “We can look back and say this thing went pretty well, but it was not at all clear in September and October that that was going to be the case.” This is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election, based on access to the group’s inner workings, never-before-seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved from across the political spectrum. It is the story of an unprecedented, creative and determined campaign whose success also reveals how close the nation came to disaster. “Every attempt to interfere with the proper outcome of the election was defeated,” says Ian Bassin, co-founder of Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan rule-of-law advocacy group. “But it’s massively important for the country to understand that it didn’t happen accidentally. The system didn’t work magically. Democracy is not self-executing.” That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures. Sometime in the fall of 2019, Mike Podhorzer became convinced the election was headed for disaster–and determined to protect it. This was not his usual purview. For nearly a quarter-century, Podhorzer, senior adviser to the president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s largest union federation, has marshaled the latest tactics and data to help its favored candidates win elections. Unassuming and professorial, he isn’t the sort of hair-gelled “political strategist” who shows up on cable news. Among Democratic insiders, he’s known as the wizard behind some of the biggest advances in political technology in recent decades. A group of liberal strategists he brought together in the early 2000s led to the creation of the Analyst Institute, a secretive firm that applies scientific methods to political campaigns. He was also involved in the founding of Catalist, the flagship progressive data company. The endless chatter in Washington about “political strategy,” Podhorzer believes, has little to do with how change really gets made. “My basic take on politics is that it’s all pretty obvious if you don’t overthink it or swallow the prevailing frameworks whole,” he once wrote. “After that, just relentlessly identify your assumptions and challenge them.” Podhorzer applies that approach to everything: when he coached his now adult son’s Little League team in the D.C. suburbs, he trained the boys not to swing at most pitches–a tactic that infuriated both their and their opponents’ parents, but won the team a series of championships. Trump’s election in 2016–credited in part to his unusual strength among the sort of blue collar white voters who once dominated the AFL-CIO–prompted Podhorzer to question his assumptions about voter behavior. He began circulating weekly number-crunching memos to a small circle of allies and hosting strategy sessions in D.C. But when he began to worry about the election itself, he didn’t want to seem paranoid. It was only after months of research that he introduced his concerns in his newsletter in October 2019. The usual tools of data, analytics and polling would not be sufficient in a situation where the President himself was trying to disrupt the election, he wrote. “Most of our planning takes us through Election Day,” he noted. “But, we are not prepared for the two most likely outcomes”–Trump losing and refusing to concede, and Trump winning the Electoral College (despite losing the popular vote) by corrupting the voting process in key states. “We desperately need to systematically ‘red-team’ this election so that we can anticipate and plan for the worst we know will be coming our way.” It turned out Podhorzer wasn’t the only one thinking in these terms. He began to hear from others eager to join forces. The Fight Back Table, a coalition of “resistance” organizations, had begun scenario-planning around the potential for a contested election, gathering liberal activists at the local and national level into what they called the Democracy Defense Coalition. Voting-rights and civil rights organizations were raising alarms. A group of former elected officials was researching emergency powers they feared Trump might exploit. Protect Democracy was assembling a bipartisan election-crisis task force. “It turned out that once you said it out loud, people agreed,” Podhorzer says, “and it started building momentum.” He spent months pondering scenarios and talking to experts. It wasn’t hard to find liberals who saw Trump as a dangerous dictator, but Podhorzer was careful to steer clear of hysteria. What he wanted to know was not how American democracy was dying but how it might be kept alive. The chief difference between the U.S. and countries that lost their grip on democracy, he concluded, was that America’s decentralized election system couldn’t be rigged in one fell swoop. That presented an opportunity to shore it up. On March 3, Podhorzer drafted a three-page confidential memo titled “Threats to the 2020 Election.” “Trump has made it clear that this will not be a fair election, and that he will reject anything but his own re-election as ‘fake’ and rigged,” he wrote. “On Nov. 3, should the media report otherwise, he will use the right-wing information system to establish his narrative and incite his supporters to protest.” The memo laid out four categories of challenges: attacks on voters, attacks on election administration, attacks on Trump’s political opponents and “efforts to reverse the results of the election.” Then COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary-election season. Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff polling places. But political disagreements, intensified by Trump’s crusade against mail voting, prevented some states from making it easier to vote absentee and for jurisdictions to count those votes in a timely manner. Chaos ensued. Ohio shut down in-person voting for its primary, leading to minuscule turnout. A poll-worker shortage in Milwaukee–where Wisconsin’s heavily Democratic Black population is concentrated–left just five open polling places, down from 182. In New York, vote counting took more than a month. Suddenly, the potential for a November meltdown was obvious. In his apartment in the D.C. suburbs, Podhorzer began working from his laptop at his kitchen table, holding back-to-back Zoom meetings for hours a day with his network of contacts across the progressive universe: the labor movement; the institutional left, like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace; resistance groups like Indivisible and MoveOn; progressive data geeks and strategists, representatives of donors and foundations, state-level grassroots organizers, racial-justice activists and others. In April, Podhorzer began hosting a weekly 2½-hour Zoom. It was structured around a series of rapid-fire five-minute presentations on everything from which ads were working to messaging to legal strategy. The invitation-only gatherings soon attracted hundreds, creating a rare shared base of knowledge for the fractious progressive movement. “At the risk of talking trash about the left, there’s not a lot of good information sharing,” says Anat Shenker-Osorio, a close Podhorzer friend whose poll-tested messaging guidance shaped the group’s approach. “There’s a lot of not-invented-here syndrome, where people won’t consider a good idea if they didn’t come up with it.” The meetings became the galactic center for a constellation of operatives across the left who shared overlapping goals but didn’t usually work in concert. The group had no name, no leaders and no hierarchy, but it kept the disparate actors in sync. “Pod played a critical behind-the-scenes role in keeping different pieces of the movement infrastructure in communication and aligned,” says Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party. “You have the litigation space, the organizing space, the political people just focused on the W, and their strategies aren’t always aligned. He allowed this ecosystem to work together.” Protecting the election would require an effort of unprecedented scale. As 2020 progressed, it stretched to Congress, Silicon Valley and the nation’s statehouses. It drew energy from the summer’s racial-justice protests, many of whose leaders were a key part of the liberal alliance. And eventually it reached across the aisle, into the world of Trump-skeptical Republicans appalled by his attacks on democracy. The first task was overhauling America’s balky election infrastructure–in the middle of a pandemic. For the thousands of local, mostly nonpartisan officials who administer elections, the most urgent need was money. They needed protective equipment like masks, gloves and hand sanitizer. They needed to pay for postcards letting people know they could vote absentee–or, in some states, to mail ballots to every voter. They needed additional staff and scanners to process ballots. In March, activists appealed to Congress to steer COVID relief money to election administration. Led by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, more than 150 organizations signed a letter to every member of Congress seeking $2 billion in election funding. It was somewhat successful: the CARES Act, passed later that month, contained $400 million in grants to state election administrators. But the next tranche of relief funding didn’t add to that number. It wasn’t going to be enough. Private philanthropy stepped into the breach. An assortment of foundations contributed tens of millions in election-administration funding. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative chipped in $300 million. “It was a failure at the federal level that 2,500 local election officials were forced to apply for philanthropic grants to fill their needs,” says Amber McReynolds, a former Denver election official who heads the nonpartisan National Vote at Home Institute. McReynolds’ two-year-old organization became a clearinghouse for a nation struggling to adapt. The institute gave secretaries of state from both parties technical advice on everything from which vendors to use to how to locate drop boxes. Local officials are the most trusted sources of election information, but few can afford a press secretary, so the institute distributed communications tool kits. In a presentation to Podhorzer’s group, McReynolds detailed the importance of absentee ballots for shortening lines at polling places and preventing an election crisis. The institute’s work helped 37 states and D.C. bolster mail voting. But it wouldn’t be worth much if people didn’t take advantage. Part of the challenge was logistical: each state has different rules for when and how ballots should be requested and returned. The Voter Participation Center, which in a normal year would have supported local groups deploying canvassers door-to-door to get out the vote, instead conducted focus groups in April and May to find out what would get people to vote by mail. In August and September, it sent ballot applications to 15 million people in key states, 4.6 million of whom returned them. In mailings and digital ads, the group urged people not to wait for Election Day. “All the work we have done for 17 years was built for this moment of bringing democracy to people’s doorsteps,” says Tom Lopach, the center’s CEO. The effort had to overcome heightened skepticism in some communities. Many Black voters preferred to exercise their franchise in person or didn’t trust the mail. National civil rights groups worked with local organizations to get the word out that this was the best way to ensure one’s vote was counted. In Philadelphia, for example, advocates distributed “voting safety kits” containing masks, hand sanitizer and informational brochures. “We had to get the message out that this is safe, reliable, and you can trust it,” says Hannah Fried of All Voting Is Local. At the same time, Democratic lawyers battled a historic tide of pre-election litigation. The pandemic intensified the parties’ usual tangling in the courts. But the lawyers noticed something else as well. “The litigation brought by the Trump campaign, of a piece with the broader campaign to sow doubt about mail voting, was making novel claims and using theories no court has ever accepted,” says Wendy Weiser, a voting-rights expert at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU. “They read more like lawsuits designed to send a message rather than achieve a legal outcome.” In the end, nearly half the electorate cast ballots by mail in 2020, practically a revolution in how people vote. About a quarter voted early in person. Only a quarter of voters cast their ballots the traditional way: in person on Election Day. Bad actors spreading false information is nothing new. For decades, campaigns have grappled with everything from anonymous calls claiming the election has been rescheduled to fliers spreading nasty smears about candidates’ families. But Trump’s lies and conspiracy theories, the viral force of social media and the involvement of foreign meddlers made disinformation a broader, deeper threat to the 2020 vote. Laura Quinn, a veteran progressive operative who co-founded Catalist, began studying this problem a few years ago. She piloted a nameless, secret project, which she has never before publicly discussed, that tracked disinformation online and tried to figure out how to combat it. One component was tracking dangerous lies that might otherwise spread unnoticed. Researchers then provided information to campaigners or the media to track down the sources and expose them. The most important takeaway from Quinn’s research, however, was that engaging with toxic content only made it worse. “When you get attacked, the instinct is to push back, call it out, say, ‘This isn’t true,'” Quinn says. “But the more engagement something gets, the more the platforms boost it. The algorithm reads that as, ‘Oh, this is popular; people want more of it.'” The solution, she concluded, was to pressure platforms to enforce their rules, both by removing content or accounts that spread disinformation and by more aggressively policing it in the first place. “The platforms have policies against certain types of malign behavior, but they haven’t been enforcing them,” she says. Quinn’s research gave ammunition to advocates pushing social media platforms to take a harder line. In November 2019, Mark Zuckerberg invited nine civil rights leaders to dinner at his home, where they warned him about the danger of the election-related falsehoods that were already spreading unchecked. “It took pushing, urging, conversations, brainstorming, all of that to get to a place where we ended up with more rigorous rules and enforcement,” says Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who attended the dinner and also met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and others. (Gupta has been nominated for Associate Attorney General by President Biden.) “It was a struggle, but we got to the point where they understood the problem. Was it enough? Probably not. Was it later than we wanted? Yes. But it was really important, given the level of official disinformation, that they had those rules in place and were tagging things and taking them down.” Beyond battling bad information, there was a need to explain a rapidly changing election process. It was crucial for voters to understand that despite what Trump was saying, mail-in votes weren’t susceptible to fraud and that it would be normal if some states weren’t finished counting votes on election night. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic former House leader turned high-powered lobbyist, spearheaded one coalition. “We wanted to get a really bipartisan group of former elected officials, Cabinet secretaries, military leaders and so on, aimed mainly at messaging to the public but also speaking to local officials–the secretaries of state, attorneys general, governors who would be in the eye of the storm–to let them know we wanted to help,” says Gephardt, who worked his contacts in the private sector to put $20 million behind the effort. Wamp, the former GOP Congressman, worked through the nonpartisan reform group Issue One to rally Republicans to the effort. “We thought we should bring some bipartisan element of unity around what constitutes a free and fair election,” Wamp says. The 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans on the National Council on Election Integrity met on Zoom at least once a week. They ran ads in six states, made statements, wrote articles and alerted local officials to potential problems. “We had rabid Trump supporters who agreed to serve on the council based on the idea that this is honest,” Wamp says. This is going to be just as important, he told them, to convince the liberals when Trump wins. “Whichever way it cuts, we’re going to stick together.” The Voting Rights Lab and IntoAction created state-specific memes and graphics, spread by email, text, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, urging that every vote be counted. Together, they were viewed more than 1 billion times. Protect Democracy’s election task force issued reports and held media briefings with high-profile experts across the political spectrum, resulting in widespread coverage of potential election issues and fact-checking of Trump’s false claims. The organization’s tracking polls found the message was being heard: the percentage of the public that didn’t expect to know the winner on election night gradually rose until by late October, it was over 70%. A majority also believed that a prolonged count wasn’t a sign of problems. “We knew exactly what Trump was going to do: he was going to try to use the fact that Democrats voted by mail and Republicans voted in person to make it look like he was ahead, claim victory, say the mail-in votes were fraudulent and try to get them thrown out,” says Protect Democracy’s Bassin. Setting public expectations ahead of time helped undercut those lies. The alliance took a common set of themes from the research Shenker-Osorio presented at Podhorzer’s Zooms. Studies have shown that when people don’t think their vote will count or fear casting it will be a hassle, they’re far less likely to participate. Throughout election season, members of Podhorzer’s group minimized incidents of voter intimidation and tamped down rising liberal hysteria about Trump’s expected refusal to concede. They didn’t want to amplify false claims by engaging them, or put people off voting by suggesting a rigged game. “When you say, ‘These claims of fraud are spurious,’ what people hear is ‘fraud,'” Shenker-Osorio says. “What we saw in our pre-election research was that anything that reaffirmed Trump’s power or cast him as an authoritarian diminished people’s desire to vote.” Podhorzer, meanwhile, was warning everyone he knew that polls were underestimating Trump’s support. The data he shared with media organizations who would be calling the election was “tremendously useful” to understand what was happening as the votes rolled in, according to a member of a major network’s political unit who spoke with Podhorzer before Election Day. Most analysts had recognized there would be a “blue shift” in key battlegrounds– the surge of votes breaking toward Democrats, driven by tallies of mail-in ballots– but they hadn’t comprehended how much better Trump was likely to do on Election Day. “Being able to document how big the absentee wave would be and the variance by state was essential,” the analyst says. The racial-justice uprising sparked by George Floyd’s killing in May was not primarily a political movement. The organizers who helped lead it wanted to harness its momentum for the election without allowing it to be co-opted by politicians. Many of those organizers were part of Podhorzer’s network, from the activists in battleground states who partnered with the Democracy Defense Coalition to organizations with leading roles in the Movement for Black Lives. The best way to ensure people’s voices were heard, they decided, was to protect their ability to vote. “We started thinking about a program that would complement the traditional election-protection area but also didn’t rely on calling the police,” says Nelini Stamp, the Working Families Party’s national organizing director. They created a force of “election defenders” who, unlike traditional poll watchers, were trained in de-escalation techniques. During early voting and on Election Day, they surrounded lines of voters in urban areas with a “joy to the polls” effort that turned the act of casting a ballot into a street party. Black organizers also recruited thousands of poll workers to ensure polling places would stay open in their communities. The summer uprising had shown that people power could have a massive impact. Activists began preparing to reprise the demonstrations if Trump tried to steal the election. “Americans plan widespread protests if Trump interferes with election,” Reuters reported in October, one of many such stories. More than 150 liberal groups, from the Women’s March to the Sierra Club to Color of Change, from Democrats.com to the Democratic Socialists of America, joined the “Protect the Results” coalition. The group’s now defunct website had a map listing 400 planned postelection demonstrations, to be activated via text message as soon as Nov. 4. To stop the coup they feared, the left was ready to flood the streets. About a week before Election Day, Podhorzer received an unexpected message: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to talk. The AFL-CIO and the Chamber have a long history of antagonism. Though neither organization is explicitly partisan, the influential business lobby has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Republican campaigns, just as the nation’s unions funnel hundreds of millions to Democrats. On one side is labor, on the other management, locked in an eternal struggle for power and resources. But behind the scenes, the business community was engaged in its own anxious discussions about how the election and its aftermath might unfold. The summer’s racial-justice protests had sent a signal to business owners too: the potential for economy-disrupting civil disorder. “With tensions running high, there was a lot of concern about unrest around the election, or a breakdown in our normal way we handle contentious elections,” says Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s executive vice president and chief policy officer. These worries had led the Chamber to release a pre-election statement with the Business Roundtable, a Washington-based CEOs’ group, as well as associations of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, calling for patience and confidence as votes were counted. But Bradley wanted to send a broader, more bipartisan message. He reached out to Podhorzer, through an intermediary both men declined to name. Agreeing that their unlikely alliance would be powerful, they began to discuss a joint statement pledging their organizations’ shared commitment to a fair and peaceful election. They chose their words carefully and scheduled the statement’s release for maximum impact. As it was being finalized, Christian leaders signaled their interest in joining, further broadening its reach. The statement was released on Election Day, under the names of Chamber CEO Thomas Donohue, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka, and the heads of the National Association of Evangelicals and the National African American Clergy Network. “It is imperative that election officials be given the space and time to count every vote in accordance with applicable laws,” it stated. “We call on the media, the candidates and the American people to exercise patience with the process and trust in our system, even if it requires more time than usual.” The groups added, “Although we may not always agree on desired outcomes up and down the ballot, we are united in our call for the American democratic process to proceed without violence, intimidation or any other tactic that makes us weaker as a nation.” Election night began with many Democrats despairing. Trump was running ahead of pre-election polling, winning Florida, Ohio and Texas easily and keeping Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania too close to call. But Podhorzer was unperturbed when I spoke to him that night: the returns were exactly in line with his modeling. He had been warning for weeks that Trump voters’ turnout was surging. As the numbers dribbled out, he could tell that as long as all the votes were counted, Trump would lose. The liberal alliance gathered for an 11 p.m. Zoom call. Hundreds joined; many were freaking out. “It was really important for me and the team in that moment to help ground people in what we had already known was true,” says Angela Peoples, director for the Democracy Defense Coalition. Podhorzer presented data to show the group that victory was in hand. While he was talking, Fox News surprised everyone by calling Arizona for Biden. The public-awareness campaign had worked: TV anchors were bending over backward to counsel caution and frame the vote count accurately. The question then became what to do next. The conversation that followed was a difficult one, led by the activists charged with the protest strategy. “We wanted to be mindful of when was the right time to call for moving masses of people into the street,” Peoples says. As much as they were eager to mount a show of strength, mobilizing immediately could backfire and put people at risk. Protests that devolved into violent clashes would give Trump a pretext to send in federal agents or troops as he had over the summer. And rather than elevate Trump’s complaints by continuing to fight him, the alliance wanted to send the message that the people had spoken. So the word went out: stand down. Protect the Results announced that it would “not be activating the entire national mobilization network today, but remains ready to activate if necessary.” On Twitter, outraged progressives wondered what was going on. Why wasn’t anyone trying to stop Trump’s coup? Where were all the protests? Podhorzer credits the activists for their restraint. “They had spent so much time getting ready to hit the streets on Wednesday. But they did it,” he says. “Wednesday through Friday, there was not a single Antifa vs. Proud Boys incident like everyone was expecting. And when that didn’t materialize, I don’t think the Trump campaign had a backup plan.” Activists reoriented the Protect the Results protests toward a weekend of celebration. “Counter their disinfo with our confidence & get ready to celebrate,” read the messaging guidance Shenker-Osorio presented to the liberal alliance on Friday, Nov. 6. “Declare and fortify our win. Vibe: confident, forward-looking, unified–NOT passive, anxious.” The voters, not the candidates, would be the protagonists of the story. The planned day of celebration happened to coincide with the election being called on Nov. 7. Activists dancing in the streets of Philadelphia blasted Beyoncé over an attempted Trump campaign press conference; the Trumpers’ next confab was scheduled for Four Seasons Total Landscaping outside the city center, which activists believe was not a coincidence. “The people of Philadelphia owned the streets of Philadelphia,” crows the Working Families Party’s Mitchell. “We made them look ridiculous by contrasting our joyous celebration of democracy with their clown show.” The votes had been counted. Trump had lost. But the battle wasn’t over. In Podhorzer’s presentations, winning the vote was only the first step to winning the election. After that came winning the count, winning the certification, winning the Electoral College and winning the transition–steps that are normally formalities but that he knew Trump would see as opportunities for disruption. Nowhere would that be more evident than in Michigan, where Trump’s pressure on local Republicans came perilously close to working–and where liberal and conservative pro-democracy forces joined to counter it. It was around 10 p.m. on election night in Detroit when a flurry of texts lit up the phone of Art Reyes III. A busload of Republican election observers had arrived at the TCF Center, where votes were being tallied. They were crowding the vote-counting tables, refusing to wear masks, heckling the mostly Black workers. Reyes, a Flint native who leads We the People Michigan, was expecting this. For months, conservative groups had been sowing suspicion about urban vote fraud. “The language was, ‘They’re going to steal the election; there will be fraud in Detroit,’ long before any vote was cast,” Reyes says. He made his way to the arena and sent word to his network. Within 45 minutes, dozens of reinforcements had arrived. As they entered the arena to provide a counterweight to the GOP observers inside, Reyes took down their cell-phone numbers and added them to a massive text chain. Racial-justice activists from Detroit Will Breathe worked alongside suburban women from Fems for Dems and local elected officials. Reyes left at 3 a.m., handing the text chain over to a disability activist. As they mapped out the steps in the election-certification process, activists settled on a strategy of foregrounding the people’s right to decide, demanding their voices be heard and calling attention to the racial implications of disenfranchising Black Detroiters. They flooded the Wayne County canvassing board’s Nov. 17 certification meeting with on-message testimony; despite a Trump tweet, the Republican board members certified Detroit’s votes. Election boards were one pressure point; another was GOP-controlled legislatures, who Trump believed could declare the election void and appoint their own electors. And so the President invited the GOP leaders of the Michigan legislature, House Speaker Lee Chatfield and Senate majority leader Mike Shirkey, to Washington on Nov. 20. It was a perilous moment. If Chatfield and Shirkey agreed to do Trump’s bidding, Republicans in other states might be similarly bullied. “I was concerned things were going to get weird,” says Jeff Timmer, a former Michigan GOP executive director turned anti-Trump activist. Norm Eisen describes it as “the scariest moment” of the entire election. The democracy defenders launched a full-court press. Protect Democracy’s local contacts researched the lawmakers’ personal and political motives. Issue One ran television ads in Lansing. The Chamber’s Bradley kept close tabs on the process. Wamp, the former Republican Congressman, called his former colleague Mike Rogers, who wrote an op-ed for the Detroit newspapers urging officials to honor the will of the voters. Three former Michigan governors–Republicans John Engler and Rick Snyder and Democrat Jennifer Granholm–jointly called for Michigan’s electoral votes to be cast free of pressure from the White House. Engler, a former head of the Business Roundtable, made phone calls to influential donors and fellow GOP elder statesmen who could press the lawmakers privately. The pro-democracy forces were up against a Trumpified Michigan GOP controlled by allies of Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chair, and Betsy DeVos, the former Education Secretary and a member of a billionaire family of GOP donors. On a call with his team on Nov. 18, Bassin vented that his side’s pressure was no match for what Trump could offer. “Of course he’s going to try to offer them something,” Bassin recalls thinking. “Head of the Space Force! Ambassador to wherever! We can’t compete with that by offering carrots. We need a stick.” If Trump were to offer something in exchange for a personal favor, that would likely constitute bribery, Bassin reasoned. He phoned Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan, to see if Primus agreed and would make the argument publicly. Primus said he thought the meeting itself was inappropriate, and got to work on an op-ed for Politico warning that the state attorney general–a Democrat–would have no choice but to investigate. When the piece posted on Nov. 19, the attorney general’s communications director tweeted it. Protect Democracy soon got word that the lawmakers planned to bring lawyers to the meeting with Trump the next day. Reyes’ activists scanned flight schedules and flocked to the airports on both ends of Shirkey’s journey to D.C., to underscore that the lawmakers were being scrutinized. After the meeting, the pair announced they’d pressed the President to deliver COVID relief for their constituents and informed him they saw no role in the election process. Then they went for a drink at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. A street artist projected their images onto the outside of the building along with the words THE WORLD IS WATCHING. That left one last step: the state canvassing board, made up of two Democrats and two Republicans. One Republican, a Trumper employed by the DeVos family’s political nonprofit, was not expected to vote for certification. The other Republican on the board was a little-known lawyer named Aaron Van Langevelde. He sent no signals about what he planned to do, leaving everyone on edge. When the meeting began, Reyes’s activists flooded the livestream and filled Twitter with their hashtag, #alleyesonmi. A board accustomed to attendance in the single digits suddenly faced an audience of thousands. In hours of testimony, the activists emphasized their message of respecting voters’ wishes and affirming democracy rather than scolding the officials. Van Langevelde quickly signaled he would follow precedent. The vote was 3-0 to certify; the other Republican abstained. After that, the dominoes fell. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and the rest of the states certified their electors. Republican officials in Arizona and Georgia stood up to Trump’s bullying. And the Electoral College voted on schedule on Dec. 14. There was one last milestone on Podhorzer’s mind: Jan. 6. On the day Congress would meet to tally the electoral count, Trump summoned his supporters to D.C. for a rally. Much to their surprise, the thousands who answered his call were met by virtually no counterdemonstrators. To preserve safety and ensure they couldn’t be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was “strenuously discouraging counter activity,” Podhorzer texted me the morning of Jan. 6, with a crossed-fingers emoji. Trump addressed the crowd that afternoon, peddling the lie that lawmakers or Vice President Mike Pence could reject states’ electoral votes. He told them to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell.” Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building. As lawmakers fled for their lives and his own supporters were shot and trampled, Trump praised the rioters as “very special.” It was his final attack on democracy, and once again, it failed. By standing down, the democracy campaigners outfoxed their foes. “We won by the skin of our teeth, honestly, and that’s an important point for folks to sit with,” says the Democracy Defense Coalition’s Peoples. “There’s an impulse for some to say voters decided and democracy won. But it’s a mistake to think that this election cycle was a show of strength for democracy. It shows how vulnerable democracy is.” The members of the alliance to protect the election have gone their separate ways. The Democracy Defense Coalition has been disbanded, though the Fight Back Table lives on. Protect Democracy and the good-government advocates have turned their attention to pressing reforms in Congress. Left-wing activists are pressuring the newly empowered Democrats to remember the voters who put them there, while civil rights groups are on guard against further attacks on voting. Business leaders denounced the Jan. 6 attack, and some say they will no longer donate to lawmakers who refused to certify Biden’s victory. Podhorzer and his allies are still holding their Zoom strategy sessions, gauging voters’ views and developing new messages. And Trump is in Florida, facing his second impeachment, deprived of the Twitter and Facebook accounts he used to push the nation to its breaking point. As I was reporting this article in November and December, I heard different claims about who should get the credit for thwarting Trump’s plot. Liberals argued the role of bottom-up people power shouldn’t be overlooked, particularly the contributions of people of color and local grassroots activists. Others stressed the heroism of GOP officials like Van Langevelde and Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, who stood up to Trump at considerable cost. The truth is that neither likely could have succeeded without the other. “It’s astounding how close we came, how fragile all this really is,” says Timmer, the former Michigan GOP executive director. “It’s like when Wile E. Coyote runs off the cliff–if you don’t look down, you don’t fall. Our democracy only survives if we all believe and don’t look down.” Democracy won in the end. The will of the people prevailed. But it’s crazy, in retrospect, that this is what it took to put on an election in the United States of America. –With reporting by LESLIE DICKSTEIN, MARIAH ESPADA and SIMMONE SHAH Correction appended, Feb. 5: The original version of this story misstated the name of Norm Eisen’s organization.

,,"BETHLEHEM, Pa.  — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center's executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Mr. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Mr. Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Mr. Santiago isn't so sure. It's the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away."" Mr. Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country's struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Mr. Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation's founding documents were created. Mr. Biden warned that Mr. Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic."" Mr. Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country's democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden's messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Mr. Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Mr. Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Mr. Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Mr. Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Mr. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward."" He supported Mr. Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Mr. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Mr. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Mr. Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump."" Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Mr. Trump is leading it. That's not out of any worry that Mr. Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Mr. Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Mr. Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Mr. Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president's pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country's largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Mr. Borick said. Mr. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Mr. Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Ms. Kodama encounters are not listening to Mr. Biden's messages about a dark future under Mr. Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Mr. Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Mr. Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Mr. Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden's campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center's board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Mr. Biden in part because of how he thought Mr. Trump's rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. ""It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Mr. Lopez thinks messages of fear and Mr. Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county's working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

,Biden losing Arab-American voters in swing state,"President Joe Biden's response to the Israel-Hamas war has sparked anger in a state that helped deliver him victory in 2020. Will there be a political cost? Nadia Ayoub is desperately scrolling through social media, looking for 18-year-old Mohamed Raed Abu Hussain among images coming out of Gaza. ""I zoom into these horrible graphic pictures - I look to see is he in the background, is he somewhere? Are they searching for him? I'm just trying to find any clue that leads to him,"" she says. Mohamed is instantly recognisable - he wears large black glasses and is missing a leg. In 2018, he spent five months with Nadia and her husband Mike, in Dearborn, Michigan, to receive medical treatment. A local facility gave him a prosthetic leg. ""He's the cutest sweetest little kid,"" Mike says. ""I will always love him like a son."" They kept in touch after he returned home to Gaza, and last week the Ayoubs - who are Lebanese Muslims - received a WhatsApp message in which he said he was heading to Jabalia refugee camp in the north of the territory. ""Don't worry about me,"" he wrote. And since then, nothing. On a crisp autumn day, the couple joined dozens of people at an outdoor food truck market to fundraise for civilians in Gaza. They are angry with President Joe Biden over his strong support for Israel's actions in Gaza in the aftermath of the attacks by Hamas on 7 October. This has been made worse for them by the US vetoing a UN call for a ceasefire. Hamas gunmen killed more than 1,400 people and took 241 hostages in the attack. Since then, Israel has been carrying out retaliatory strikes on Gaza, in which 10,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ""President Biden has blood on his hands,"" says Mike. ""He had my vote - he's lost it forever,"" Nadia adds. It's a sentiment that's widespread across the city, where more than half the population is of Arab heritage. The local Arab American News newspaper is blunt, accompanying a picture of the president with the headline: ""He lost our votes."" In a swing state like Michigan, the numbers will really matter in 2024. Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by 10,000 votes. President Biden took it back from him by about 154,000 votes in 2020. Given there are about 200,000 Muslim American voters in Michigan, to many it's clear that he needs their votes. But people in Dearborn feel betrayed, says local official Sam Baydoun. ""How can they vote for the president when they see these atrocities on live TV, and he is the one who is enabling this by sending more weapons?"" the county commissioner asks. President Biden's staunch support of Israel is not new, but Mr Baydoun says he is surprised the president visited Tel Aviv during a war and met the Israeli cabinet. A summit with Arab leaders in Jordan was cancelled after a strike on a hospital in Gaza. ""We need an immediate ceasefire. If the election was held today he would not get the Arab vote,"" Mr Baydoun says. The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, says that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%. That would be the first time in nearly 30 years that the Democrats were not the party of choice for Arab American voters. Mr Baydoun is a Democrat, and says the war has made his job tougher: ""How can I tell someone today to vote for President Biden?"" he asks. The dilemma for many in Dearborn is that the alternative is Donald Trump - an unpopular choice given he signed an executive order when in office that briefly barred travellers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. ""I'm not going to tell people to vote for Trump. Obviously, I will not vote for Trump,"" the commissioner says. Political analyst Larry Sabato says Mr Trump was in some ways a more pro-Israel president, infuriating Arab states by moving the capital to Jerusalem. But that could mean Arab Americans stay at home, even if that benefits Mr Trump, Mr Sabato says. New polling by Siena College for the New York Times suggests Mr Biden loses out to Mr Trump in swing states like Michigan on the question of who is more trusted to handle the Israel-Hamas conflict. Nada Al-Hanooti's job is to turn out the Muslim American vote in Michigan, and he can sense a change in mood. ""I'm hearing friends, and colleagues from other institutions that they're either voting third party or they're staying home."" Ms Al-Hanooti is executive director of Emgage, a civic engagement group that says it was instrumental in helping Mr Biden win Michigan in 2020. ""We made a lot of calls, sent a lot of text messages, did a lot of voter registration, as well as signing people up for absentee ballots. Biden needs the Muslim vote in order to win Michigan."" Now she says she doesn't know what Emgage's strategy will be for 2024. ""The president's job is to be the moral compass of the nation. And right now he's lost trust and credibility with a lot of the American public."" The election is about a year away - a lifetime in politics - will this feeling fade? ""We will not forget,"" Ms Al-Hanooti say. ""This is deep heartbreak."" Israel has described the attack by Hamas as ""our 9/11"". Many in Dearborn who remember the World Trade Center attacks say the aftermath for Arabs reminds them of that time. The fatal stabbing of a six-year old Palestinian boy in Illinois, days after the attack in Israel, has deepened that sense of unease. The boy's landlord is accused of attacking him and his mother because of their religion. In recent days, President Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris have launched the country's first national strategy to counter Islamophobia. Some in Dearborn have welcomed that but most want Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza - only then will he win back their support. For others, though, the damage is done no matter what he does. In a local coffee shop, Lexi Zeidan - who is Palestinian Christian - says she's even stopped calling Mr Biden the president. He had my vote in 2020 but no longer, she says. ""Why would I ever claim him to be a president - one that doesn't stand up for what's right, that doesn't stand up for a group of people that are defenceless."" The White House has said a ceasefire would enable Hamas to regroup and instead they want a pause in Israeli bombardment to enable humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. This US stance is echoed by the UK, Canada and the European Union. Larry Sabato says it's easy to dismiss the anger clearly evident in Dearborn as heat of the moment, but the Middle East goes to the heart of Arab Americans' priorities as it does for many Jewish Americans. And while Mr Biden can't afford to lose Michigan, Mr Sabato points out that neither can he afford to lose the growing Jewish vote in other swing states like Arizona or Georgia. Nearly 1.1 million Muslim voters cast ballots in the 2020 election, and according to Pew Research, there are about 5.8 million Jews in the US. While data shows the Jewish vote is more diverse, with an increase in those voting for Republicans in 2020, polls suggest most back Democrats and are a base constituency for the party. There isn't any definitive poll so far that tells us how Jewish American voters feel about Biden's handling of the Middle East war but Mr Sabato thinks it will matter. ""A Democrat really has to do well with Jewish Americans and Arab Americans in order to win,"" he says. ""Honestly, the only way around it for Biden is for this war not to be on the front burner a year from now."" Prospect of nuclear weapons being stored in Suffolk causes concern that they could become a target. Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu vows to carry on the war against Hamas regardless of international pressure. The president says taking a two-week break without passing fresh aid is ""bizarre"" and ""outrageous"". In the civil case, a judge ordered the penalty to keep him and his sons from continuing ""fraudulent ways"". Fani Willis, who had not been expected to take the stand, holds up court papers and shouts ""it is a lie"". Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

,,"Part of the McClatchy Media Network Sunday, February 18, 2024 Today's eEdition Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling during lunch recently. Out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number of visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center's executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign that many in the area's Latino community are struggling. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the campaign coalition President Joe Biden is trying to rebuild. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination in 2024, is a danger to American democracy. Biden hopes the message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped his way after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn't so sure. It's the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. The threat messaging ""won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, a place with deep symbolism for the country's struggle for freedom, as the site of his initial campaign event for 2024, describing the upcoming race as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave in Philadelphia before the 2022 midterm elections. Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season this year. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden's messaging was resonating. They represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: Biden's warning that a second Trump presidency will undermine democratic institutions is, by itself, not enough to motivate voters. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, said her opinion of Trump was already set before Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to halt certification of Biden's victory. But she doesn't feel that reminders of that day will be sufficient to engage voters in November. Her own priorities are immigration and federal spending abroad. Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad living in a more rural area of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward."" He believes the warnings are overblown and notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls."" Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock. The bank executive from Nazareth said he also believes the threat concerns are overstated. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges,” he said. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages also will be essential elements of the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry nearly 30 years ago and is now enjoying a revival as a technology and health care hub. The county has long been a political bellwether. The last time its vote differed from the state's in a presidential election was 1948, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. Since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977, she has crossed party lines frequently — until 2016 when she voted a straight Democratic ticket for the first time. The people Kodama encounters are more likely to respond to a positive messages. She would like Biden to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. That strategy “resonates with me and with people I know,” said the artist and former teacher. For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message about Trump is not generating new concerns: “We already know who he is,” she said. Lee said in her circle the number one issue is homelessness and its companion, affordable housing. At the Lehigh Hispanic center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the 27 years he worked at Bethlehem Steel. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump's rhetoric has made targets of Latinos and other minorities. But Lopez thinks messaging about Trump imperiling democracy actually “harms the vote.” The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center's executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area's Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term.

Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote.

That's not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm.

Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country's largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey.

,"Few voters would be satisfied with Biden-Trump rematch, AP-NORC poll shows","       It's the presidential election no one is really jazzed about. Relatively few Americans are excited about a potential rematch of the 2020 election between President Joe Biden and Donald Trump, although more Republicans would be satisfied to have Trump as their nominee than Democrats would be with Biden as their standard-bearer, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That palpable apathy from voters comes even as both Biden and Trump are facing relatively few obstacles in their paths to lock down their respective parties' nominations next year. Biden has amassed broad support from Democratic officials as a handful of mostly token primary challengers have struggled to spark momentum. And despite 91 indictments across four criminal cases — including some centered on his attempts to overturn his electoral loss to Biden in 2020 — Trump's grip on GOP primary voters shows no signs of loosening a month before the first nominating contest in Iowa. ""Probably the best way to put it is, I find it sad for our country that that's our best choices,"" said Randy Johnson, 64, from Monett, Missouri. Johnson, who is a Republican, said he wishes there were a third legitimate option for president but that the political system does not make that viable and added: ""We're down to the lesser of two evils."" Andrew Collins, 35, an independent from Windham, Maine, said: ""This is probably the most uniquely horrible choice I've had in my life."" About half of Democrats say they would be very or somewhat satisfied if Biden becomes the party's 2024 nominee. About one-third of Democrats would be dissatisfied, and about 1 in 5 would be ""neither satisfied nor dissatisfied."" When it comes to the Republican Party nomination, enthusiasm is higher for GOP front-runner Donald Trump. Two-thirds of Republicans would be satisfied with Trump as the Republican nominee for 2024. About one-quarter would be dissatisfied, and 9% would be neutral. Looking at U.S. adults broadly — setting aside party affiliations — there's still not much enthusiasm for a Biden-Trump rematch. Most U.S. adults overall (56%) would be ""very"" or ""somewhat"" dissatisfied with Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024, and a similar majority (58%) would be very or somewhat dissatisfied with Trump as the GOP's pick. Nearly 3 in 10 U.S. adults, or 28%, say they would be dissatisfied with both Trump and Biden becoming their party's respective nominees – with independents (43%) being more likely than Democrats (28%) or Republicans (20%) to express their displeasure with both men gaining party nominations. Deborah Brophy is an independent who says she supported Biden in the 2020 presidential election. But now, the 67-year-old has soured on the president, saying she felt Biden is too focused on dealing with conflicts abroad rather than ""what's going on under his own nose,"" such as homelessness, gun violence and the economy. ""What's going on with Biden right now?"" said Brophy, of North Reading, Massachusetts. ""I don't think he's, health-wise, able to continue another four years in office. I think his mind is a little bit going the wrong way in the way of not being able to think."" Yet she is turned off by Trump's attitude and said he ""seems a little racist,"" even while praising his business acumen. ""So I don't know what I'm going to do,"" Brophy added. Among Democrats and Republicans alike, having a candidate who can win is given slightly more importance than having a candidate whose views represent most people in the party or even themselves, according to the AP-NORC poll. Only about 3 in 10 Democrats are ""extremely"" or ""very"" confident that the Democratic Party's process will result in nominating a candidate who can win the general election in November. About half are somewhat confident, and 18% are not very confident or not at all confident. While relatively few are highly confident they'll get a winning nominee out of the process, three-quarters of Democrats say it's ""extremely"" or ""very"" important that the party's process for nominating a presidential candidate does result in a candidate who can win the general election. Meanwhile, one-third of Republicans are extremely or very confident that the Republican Party's process for nominating a presidential candidate will result in someone who can win the general election. Slightly fewer than half, or 46%, are somewhat confident, and 2 in 10 are not very or not at all confident. Seven in 10 Republicans say it's extremely or very important that their process results in a nominee who can win in 2024. ""I've voted for Trump twice. I'll vote for him again if I had to. I certainly would not vote for Biden,"" said Joe Hill, 70, a Republican from West Point, Georgia. ""But I would welcome someone new and quite frankly, I'm not confident he can win against Biden."" Hill said he was concerned that Trump could be too polarizing with a wide swath of voters. ""I want a Republican to be elected, so I'm in favor of any Republican that would be on the ballot,"" Hill said. ""I would more so, if it wasn't him."" The poll shows neither man is viewed favorably by a majority of the U.S. public, with only 42% saying they have a favorable view of Biden and 36% saying the same of Trump. Both are generally viewed favorably within their own party: About three-quarters of Democrats have a favorable view of Biden and about 7 in 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Trump. But Republicans are more likely to say their view of Trump is strongly favorable than Democrats are to say the same of Biden, 46% vs 34%. Democrats are more likely than Republicans are to say they have only a somewhat favorable view of their party's 2024 frontrunner, 44% vs 24%. Josh Reed, of Pittsburg, California, said he prefers alternatives to Trump in the Republican field such as South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, or South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who withdrew from the race last month. But if the choice in front of voters next fall is Biden and Trump, ""it's between those two,"" said Reed, 39, a registered Republican, though he says he holds more libertarian views. ""There's no third party that's going to make a dent in anything. Sometimes it is what it is. You got to pick between those two."" He will definitely vote next year, Reed said. But, he added: ""I'm not really excited for either one of these guys.""

,,"Donald Trump’s supporters propelled him to about a 10-point victory over Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary. Here, Trump speaks at an election night party in Nashua, N.H., as Vivek Ramaswamy (from left), Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Eric Trump watch. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais Donald Trump won Tuesday’s New Hampshire Republican presidential primary by more than 10 points over Nikki Haley (54.5 to 43.2 percent) and will now sweep his way easily to the nomination. Or not. The first scenario seemed to be the general consensus of media pundits, but some noted that Trump only attracted about half of GOP voters in the N.H. primary and Iowa caucus, raising questions about how he would fare in the general election. And Haley has vowed to fight on. The next Republican primary is in her home state, South Carolina, but Trump is favored there, too. (President Biden, meanwhile, handily won the Democratic race in New Hampshire, even though voters had to write his name in.) We asked a handful of BU experts to help us sort out the results from a variety of perspectives. Tammy Vigil, associate professor of media science and senior associate dean, College of Communication: 
Despite the win in New Hampshire, the results actually illustrate weaknesses in Trump’s candidacy. The likelihood Trump will secure the Republican nomination remains high, but Tuesday’s outcome revealed distinct fissures within the Republican ranks that could provide some strategic insights for Haley now and Biden during the general election. According to exit polling, Trump is not drawing support from moderate conservatives, and a high number of New Hampshire GOP voters selected Haley to indicate their opposition to Trump. Haley should more earnestly court disaffected Republicans moving forward; Biden also needs to build a space for them in his campaign.

Christine Slaughter, assistant professor of political science, College of Arts & Sciences:
Many Republican voters are looking toward the general election, presuming that Trump will be the Republican presidential nominee. The path forward for Haley looks ragged. As former South Carolina governor, losing the Republican primary would be a final dagger to her campaign. The majority of Iowa and N.H. voters support Trump and, apparently, three of his former competitors also support his candidacy. There’s enthusiasm for him, as if he’s the incumbent.

Bruce Schulman, William E. Huntington Professor of History, College of Arts & Sciences:
It was a bad [boring] night for journalists as the results came in more or less as expected. Trump won decisively but not overwhelmingly, in a contest that figured to play more to Haley’s strengths than most other Republican primaries, while Haley finished well enough to stay in the race. The only question is whether Haley will stay in for the long haul hoping that Trump’s legal worries damage his candidacy, or whether she’ll drop out after the next contested race in South Carolina.

Paul Hare, senior lecturer in international relations, Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies, and former British ambassador to Cuba:
Most Republicans agree with Trump that foreign policy is a minor issue. For Trump, it’s personal. On Ukraine, Zelensky would not “do him a favor” over Hunter Biden. [As president, Trump asked Ukraine’s leader to investigate the younger Biden.] Trump likes Putin because Putin likes him. He dislikes Netanyahu because he congratulated Biden [on Biden’s 2020 win]. Trump wants to block Biden’s bipartisan deal on immigration and aid to Ukraine/Israel. He needs the US border issue to fester. Haley recognized US interests in foreign policy, but most Republicans see Democrats as the threat. Saudi Arabia is now the Trump family’s main business partner—in massive Saudi resort and sports deals and billions in investment funds.

Shawn M. Lynch, senior lecturer in social sciences, College of General Studies:
Haley did well among independents, which is trouble for Trump, but she cannot win the nomination. There is no Republican Party any longer, there is only the Trump Party. The Trump “Republican” electorate will not vote for a person of color over Trump. This party will, however, nominate someone who is a convicted rapist and utter incompetent facing 91 felony charges, who may well be in prison by November. The party and its MAGA base have chosen electoral suicide.

Rachel Meade, lecturer in political sciences, College of Arts & Sciences:
This means that Trump is very likely to be the nominee and Haley has become a long-shot candidate. If she can’t win in a state with so many independent voters (when her polling is strongest among independents), then it is unlikely she can win in states with a more traditional Republican voter base. However, this is not a normal election cycle in that the front-runner is under multiple indictments, with the January 6 trial scheduled to start during the primary season. Haley may be staying in the race so she could be poised as next in line in case a dramatic legal development changes Trump’s support base or causes the GOP to drop him. Even so, this looks like a long shot as his base has shown that they mostly see the trials as an example of politically motivated elites going after a leader that they see as a threat. Vigil: As a write-in candidate who didn’t officially campaign in New Hampshire, Joe Biden secured over half of the Democratic votes on Tuesday and earned more than double the combined votes cast for Dean Phillips and [Marianne] Williamson in a decisive, and completely unsurprising, result. As expected, Tuesday’s outcome indicates that neither Phillips nor Williamson are viable Democratic contenders. More revealing is how the GOP primary results could inform Biden’s general election campaign. Similar to 2020, there is a clear opportunity to earn significant votes from anti-Trump Republicans, but Biden will need to be strategic about building bipartisan appeals while coalition-building.

Slaughter: There’s about a 10 percent margin between Haley and Trump in N.H. The primary set a turnout record—with many Trump supporters and voters seeking an alternative in Haley. N.H. is a competitive state, so hopefully Biden can appeal to N.H. voters who are opposed to Trump. Processing write-in ballots takes time, so it is not yet known for sure how well or how poorly Biden fared in N.H., but he had an overwhelming victory in the votes that have been counted.

Schulman: The Democratic results mean little, but if I were Biden’s campaign manager, my line would be: “Biden outperformed Trump in New Hampshire and he wasn’t even on the ballot!”

Hare: Biden got what he wanted: a Trump rematch. Haley showed independents are overwhelmingly against Trump. Biden was fearful of having to face a moderate Haley. Trump, however, has shown most Republicans now believe something Trump himself didn’t believe. His chief of staff and his daughter have testified that Trump knew he lost to Biden. But now millions are pouring money into his coffers because they see the 2020 election as stolen—just like Trump said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his support doesn’t waver. But, as Haley remarked in New Hampshire, a Trump victory is what Democrats have been working for.

Lynch: I did not vote for Biden or Trump, but Joe Biden is the most competent president of my lifetime (1971 onward). He will win the November election in a landslide, presuming the contest is Biden vs. Trump. This is because the people that hate Trump hate him more than the people who love Trump love him. Independents have abandoned him (and will continue to do so), and there are too many people who will crawl over broken glass to keep him out of the White House. Besides, he’ll likely be imprisoned by the date of the election, and this will not expand his support.

Meade: Democrats should be focusing on the most likely scenario: a rematch with Donald Trump. They might also note the limits of an anti-Trump, pro-democracy messaging strategy, since Haley has recently been pushing something similar. Democrats will also need to show why they will be affirmatively better for voters than Trump would be—for example, by highlighting specific policies that benefit their constituencies, from the American Rescue Plan or Build Back Better Act. The MAGA base is different from the traditional GOP in having more isolationist foreign policy and more openness to social and economic spending. This can be seen in Trump’s anti-Haley ad in New Hampshire accusing her of wanting to cut Social Security [funding], and that is the area where Biden might be able to make a similar attack on Trump. Vigil: They might not. Edison Research’s exit polling shows Trump’s strength remains his core followers and that many New Hampshire primary participants were motivated opposition voters supporting Haley to register antipathy toward Trump. Trump’s current campaign messaging contains very few efforts to expand his appeal beyond the MAGA faithful—a strategy he also employed in 2020. Sticking with this approach, to win the general election, Trump will have to rely on voters abandoning Biden. While that could happen, it is a risky game plan, since failure to attract moderate Republicans and unaffiliated voters narrows Trump’s potential margin for victory. 

Slaughter: Turnout in midterm elections is generally lower than in presidential elections. This election is unprecedented, since Trump is facing criminal indictments and is the first former president to face criminal charges. This is his third presidential campaign. Campaigning will look different since court dates are approaching. It’s clear that despite his legal troubles, and attempt to overthrow the government on January 6, there are still voters and other politicians that support his third presidential bid.

Schulman: I would challenge the premises of this question. If you’re asking whether Trump (or Trumpist candidates) can win a majority of the popular vote, the answer is no. Trump will lose the popular vote by a wide margin, as he did in both 2016 and 2020. But the presidential contest will be decided in a handful of states, all of which Biden won very narrowly in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Whichever candidate takes three of those five states will win the election. So, Trump could still win the presidency even though I think Biden will handily win the popular vote.

Hare: History suggests there is never going to be a MAGA majority in the US. Trump lost by three million popular votes to Hillary Clinton and eight million to Biden. But, of course, a few states could be rogue outliers. So, 10,000 votes in Georgia, Michigan, or Arizona could decide the election. And America’s justice system may simply be too slow and incompetent to bring to trial Trump’s serious election indictments. They will prove, whatever legal boffins may say, that Trump truly is immune from prosecution. It’s that Fifth Avenue thing again.

Lynch: The Republican Party is dead and will likely be wiped out nationally in November. They will certainly lose control of the House and will not take the Senate. Biden will crush Trump. The party of Reagan and Bush is dead. It surrendered to an incompetent, narcissistic sociopath and adopted irrational, violent, and hateful politics. Good riddance. I feel it likely that some Republican states will refuse to accept the loss and begin talking secession after the election. They have nowhere else to go, with Trump definitively defeated. (Knock on wood!)

Meade: The failure of Trump to get his chosen candidates elected in midterm elections doesn’t necessarily tell us that much about how he would fare running himself. Populist charismatic appeals are usually quite specific to the individual and hard to transfer to someone else, and in Trump’s case, relates to his “outsider” reality TV and business background and unique speaking style and sense of humor. In terms of a repeat of 2020, there are some important differences there too. We are now in a post January 6 landscape, and Trump is under multiple indictments, with trials or even convictions possible by the general election, all of which could potentially benefit Biden. On the other hand, Trump has been out of the public eye long enough, particularly given not being on X (formerly Twitter), and not participating in the primary debates, that the chaos which comes with a Trump presidency and which turned off some of his own voters is less salient. Also, Biden is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm in his own base. In addition to concerns about his age, many younger voters on the left are very unhappy with how he has handled the Israel-Palestine conflict. Dissatisfaction with both Trump and Biden as candidates could also draw a higher than usual third party vote, and I think RFK, Jr., who has an outsider appeal that draws from both left and right, is particularly important to watch.

Moderators are staffed during regular business hours (EST) and can only accept comments written in English. Statistics or facts must include a citation or a link to the citation. As usual, the ‘panel of BU experts’ skips over several MAJOR points in its zeal to carry water for their preferred candidate .. Trump set a record in IA with his win there .. he won 98 of 99 counties, and gather more support than any other R candidate EVER. In N.H., Trump earned just over 100k votes in 2016 .. he got about 130k votes in 2020 .. and he will get about 170k this year, again, another record if I’m not mistaken. Haley benefitted greatly from the stupid ‘open primary’ rules in N.H. .. just like the Rs played games with Hillary and Obama in the past, the Ds played games with Trump in this cycle .. 7 of 10 voters for Haley weren’t even register Rs. Trump has incredible momentum at the moment, with his overall approval rating RISING, while Biden’s approval rating is LOWER than any other candidate EVER. Trump is out polling Biden in EVERY swing state, and in several BY A LOT .. and polling has almost always favored D candidates (remember Hillary had a near certain victory before she didn’t). I could keep going, but endeavoring to reason with partisan liberals is a fools exercise .., but lastly, not a single panel member mentioned that the Ds have shunned RFK JR, a VERY formidable candidate, who will most surely take votes from Biden who at this point is nearly incapable of campaigning. And to the panelist who referred to Biden as The Best President, blah, blah, blah .. you can’t be serious .. we now have an OPEN southern border that’s been breached somewhere between 8-12 MILLION times under Joe’s regime, major crime statistics that have clobbered EVERY major city and far too many rural areas, there are now wars raging in several countries (there were no new wars under Trump, vs several under Biden), potentially crippling Fed funds/interest rates, raging inflation, etc etc etc .. this administration is an unmitigated disaster. My guess is that you won’t share this, as censoring seems to be the way at the new BU – which is far different from the old BU, where differing views were shared. Last time I checked the US still had 48 more states yet to vote. Presuming Iowa and NH are representative of all the rest, we can skip the others — maybe scrap the primary system in the future, just let those two states decide for us all — leaving us with a choice between the inept Biden and the arrogant Trump. The only person in the country with a chance of losing to Biden is Trump.

We have two of the worst candidates in history running against each other. The system isn’t broken, the parties are. This might be the first time a 3rd party or an independent has a chance! Golly. Ambassador Hare says “Most Republicans agree with Trump that foreign policy is a minor issue.” He needs to meet some Republicans (I’m available). And it’d be nice if he represented Trump fairly on this. Shawn Lynch says the ‘Trump “Republican” will not vote for a person of color over Trump.’ Pretty vile smear, Shawn, not worthy of a faculty member at a distinguished university. Same advice: You need to meet some Republicans (I’m available, subject to an apology for the smear). The braying of like-minded ideologues with distant or no practical experience in the focus of which they opine shouldn’t be presented as expertise. Readers, especially students, deserve thoughtful analysis representing a range of viewpoints from faculty who don’t allow emotion and political wishcasting to subjugate their ability to be rational and fair. Shawn Lynch takes this intellectually vacuous exercise to a new extreme in this Q&A. He should know better. So too should the editors who asked him to contribute. How many of these faculty experts engage in meaningful ways with people outside of their elitist bubble—blue collar workers, the non-degreed, people who live in exurban and rural communities? How can they purport to understand the sensibilities and sensitivities of most voters? The smartest pundits I know, amateur and professional, are the ones who concede that conventional wisdom ended eight years ago, and it’s nearly impossible to know or make sense of what may happen in the next election.

,"I Love You, Please Vote For Biden"," If you’ve ever had a family Thanksgiving turn nuclear after Aunt Helen decided to share her opinion on All Lives Matter during the dessert course, you know it can be extremely difficult to change your loved ones’ minds about deeply held political views. But talking about these subjects with close friends and family doesn’t always lead to slammed screen doors and smashed pie plates. Sometimes these relationships provide a way into perspective-shifting conversations that might otherwise be impossible. “There is someone in your life that only you can get through to,” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram Live after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. “I need you to use your relationships to get through and check in on people and make sure they’re stepping up and doing the right thing, and they’re not staying home on Election Night, and they’re not giving their vote to Donald Trump.” The Cut talked to seven people about how they got through to that person in their lives — from jaded nonvoters to disillusioned Republicans — and convinced them to cast their vote for Joe Biden this fall. As 15-year-old Claire said of getting her Republican grandma in Florida to vote for Biden, that personal closeness can make all the difference: “She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true.” Interviews have been edited for length and clarity, and names have been changed. My dad used to be a Republican congressman. Our family always grew up pretty conservative, though it sure feels, as I get older, I’m becoming more liberal, especially with Trump in power. I think Trump is an absolute menace. There’s no way I would ever have voted for him. In 2016, I did a write-in for John Kasich, but this year I’m voting for Biden. My brother’s a retired banker down in Dallas, and he’s ten years older than me. He’s a conservative Republican, he’s a loyal soldier for the party, but he also believes Trump is a moron. He knew he wasn’t gonna vote for Trump this time; he was planning to write in Reagan’s name. And I just started pleading with him, saying, “Texas is in play. The state is so close. And if the Republicans can lose Texas, maybe that’s a wake-up call for them to get their act together.” The Republicans are pulling out every dirty trick they can to suppress voting and try and save this guy’s bacon. And I said, “You can’t just vote for Reagan or Ross Perot and feel good about it.” We talk probably three times a week on the phone, if not more. His wife is also a conservative Republican, and she can’t stand Trump, like me. She and I weren’t plotting together, but it was definitely a tag-team effort. I think my brother’s a smart guy. He’s not a fan of Joe Biden [politically], but he believes he’s a decent human being and a good man. And I think he knows that the country’s in a bad place right now and we do have to put country over party. I live in rural Pennsylvania. It’s very red, and I was a big Trump supporter in 2016 when I was in high school. As the years went on, I started to drift away, and I finally turned and got on the Bidenmobile in about September. COVID-19 was kind of the final straw for me. Other countries have beaten this back, and we’re climbing like crazy. I also personally feel like, as someone who studies climate change and someone who is LGBTQ, another four years with Donald Trump in the White House is not the best for a person like me. When I first supported Trump, I did not realize I was LGBTQ, and I wasn’t nearly as much of an environmentalist as I am now. My boyfriend and I met in 2019 and started dating this spring. He had been a Trump supporter but was increasingly on the fence, and he was starting to show the early signs of getting annoyed with Trump’s rhetoric. Still, he said he wasn’t going to break his back going to the polls, but if he did manage to go, he was gonna vote Trump, just do a straight red ticket. And then that’s when I kind of threw a lot of persuasion at him. It started as a little bit of joking banter, like, “Vote for Biden and I’ll buy you this.” And then eventually, I kind of got to him. I helped him realize that, of the two main options available, Biden was the lesser of two evils. I said, “Do you want to spend the next four years reading angry tweets and opening up Twitter and saying, ‘Oh, what did Trump do now?’” I think the first debate also really helped convince him because Trump spent the entire time attacking Joe Biden’s son and Joe Biden as a person, and I think he felt that Biden at least portrayed an ounce of professionalism that was desperately needed. He kind of just said, “Fine, finally I get it, I’ll do it.”  My son is in the National Guard; he’s 21. He’s like a lot of people in that generation, where they think it doesn’t really matter. He’s pretty progressive, he supported Bernie, and none of his friends are voting, because they don’t like Biden either. But he’s been activated four times now during COVID, for protests in Seattle and for COVID relief, doing testing and food banks, and he’ll be activated for the election, for whatever may or may not happen. In encouraging him to vote, I said, “Remember, you’re also voting for your boss, because we also have a tight gubernatorial race.” I told him, you know, “If we get a conservative governor here, that guy is gonna activate you every time somebody breathes wrong.” He doesn’t want to be at those protests; if he had his way, he’d likely be on the other side of them. I’ve voted in every election since I turned 18, but this is his first presidential election. It’s hard to convey to him how different this election is from any other during my lifetime, and he really doesn’t have the luxury of standing idly by, waiting for a better candidate. He got his ballot, and I was like, “Are you gonna fill it out?” I said, “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, but this is why I really want you to vote for Biden.” And he did it. My grandma lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She has been a Republican pretty much her whole life, but she did not agree with what Trump was doing with COVID, because she’s older and she’s immunocompromised. I FaceTime her every Sunday for about an hour. A year ago, we didn’t really talk about politics. But in the past couple months, I’ve been trying to incorporate it a little bit more because I had a feeling that she wasn’t going to vote. I tried to show her that not everyone has benefited from Trump being president. For example, she is upper class, and my mom and dad and brother are not, and I kind of showed her that not taxing everyone equally is not effective. And she said she never thought about how taxing the upper class would be helpful to everybody else. Especially with Black Lives Matter becoming bigger this year, I think she also realized that racism is a really big problem. Where she lives, it’s mostly white people, and she hasn’t lived with other minorities in a really long time. And I started explaining the protests and how police were targeting Black people, because I don’t think she really understood. Recently, she told me that she was going to vote for Biden because she believes Trump is evil and it’s the right thing to do, not only thinking about herself but thinking about everybody. It was awesome.
Me and her have gotten really close. And I think that us being really close really helped me convince her, because she trusts me and respects my opinion. She said that she probably wouldn’t have listened to a random person’s opinion, but she knows me and she thinks that I wouldn’t tell her something that wasn’t true. I tried to get my dad to vote blue in 2016. I don’t think that worked — he still hasn’t really said who he voted for, but I think he has pretty much always voted Republican. Since then, anytime I thought Trump did something dumb, I would try to start a conversation, and that didn’t really work. But as this election got closer, I was really trying to tell him about how important it would be for my future and potentially my kids’ future if I have kids. Millennials have this idea that it’s not ethical to necessarily bring kids into the world when there are politicians in office that don’t believe in climate change. He thought that idea was really out there, and he said he couldn’t believe I thought that way. He thought that’s kind of a crazy way to think about having kids, like it doesn’t really matter who’s in office, you’re gonna live your life. Marrying those things together, I think, was probably a new concept for him. He did definitely push back and say that’s not the way to think about having kids, and I said, “Well, that’s the way that I’m thinking about it, and you could help with this if you voted for Biden. That would be a step in the right direction.”   While he was never interested in talking about me having grandkids before, the past few years he has kind of been asking me what’s going on. Prior to that, I would have never thought that could be a way in. My mom sent me a photo of his completed ballot [for Biden]; he wouldn’t send it to me. I think he’s still begrudgingly doing it, and that doesn’t feel great, but I guess a win’s a win. The majority of my family is completely out of touch with politics. They don’t understand how policies and the people we elect can affect their lives. They just tend to complain. My sister hasn’t voted in over 30 years. She does watch TV, but because Trump has so dominated the airwaves, she’s just sick and tired of it. She was just frustrated by his childish behavior. And I said, “Let’s do something about it. You need to go vote.” And she’s like, “Dan, I haven’t voted in years, and I’m blind.” She actually went blind this past year because of diabetes, and she’s only gone blind in the last six or seven months so she’s still struggling with how to live this way. So I printed off the Missouri absentee ballot application and sent her hard copies of it, and I walked her through the ballot and explained how to get it submitted in Missouri and all that. And because I went to the effort to make it easier for her, she was motivated to follow through, but I did have to lead her every step of the way. Miranda and I have been friends since we were next-door neighbors in second grade. We can talk about anything without being judgmental. I’ve always called her my one Republican friend, and she’s always called me her tree-hugging friend. Politics was never a major topic of discussion for us. Of course, Trump has changed that. I sort of explained to her what’s happening around the world and showed how fascism and authoritarianism are rising up everywhere, like Hungary, Poland, Brazil, Turkey, India, and I started naming off all the countries that have fallen to authoritarian regimes over the last decade and kind of brought it back home. One of my children has Jewish heritage, and one of my children has Muslim heritage and I sort of explained to her how terrified I am for them. We’re applying, through my husband, for Italian citizenship. That’s how scared we are. I think that sort of brought it home to a personal level. I remember we were talking about race issues, and I tried to explain it very simply. I said, “Miranda, do you think that you would have the same life if you had been born to the same parents and lived in the same house next door to me and everything was the same except you were Black instead of white?” And I think she was able to realize that no, she wouldn’t have had the same life — like my parents back then wouldn’t have let me be friends with her. I come from a very racist family, and things wouldn’t have been the same. I feel like if I were to go to a Trump supporter that I ran into who didn’t love me, it’s futile for me to waste my breath trying to convince them of anything. But Miranda knows me, and I feel like you can convince the people that love you. Really the only way I’ve been able to reach people is “If you believe this is happening, or if you believe it could be happening, and if you love me, don’t you care about what that’s gonna mean?” Because our family, I feel like, is in a particularly vulnerable spot. That’s how I got through to her.   Save 40% and get two free gifts, including our new Cut tote.  ",https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/interviews-how-i-convinced-someone-to-vote-for-joe-biden.html,
,Fake 'Biden' robocall tells Democrats to stay home,"As New Hampshire voters prepared to cast their votes in the state's first-in-the nation primary, a robocall is circulating in the state urging Democrats to stay home - using a fake audio of US President Joe Biden. ""It's important that you save your vote for the November election ... voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" the call says. The White House confirmed Monday that the call was not recorded by Biden and said the incident highlighted the challenges emerging technologies presented, especially before the November presidential election. ""The president has been clear that there are risks associated with deep fakes. Fake images and misinformation can be exacerbated by emerging technologies,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters in Washington. New Hampshire Attorney-General John Formella announced he was investigating an apparent ""unlawful attempt to disrupt the New Hampshire Presidential Primary Election and to suppress New Hampshire voters"". Biden's campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said the call was ""disinformation"" and an attempt to suppress voting. Support for Biden's write-in campaign will be closely watched amid weak polls for the president, although the results have no bearing on the Democratic Party's nominating contest. The call was first reported by NBC News. Biden's name is not on the ballot on Tuesday because the national Democratic Party made South Carolina their first official primary, ending New Hampshire's historical status and angering some Democrats there. In the audio, the Biden ""voice"" is heard using one of his signature phrases, ""What a bunch of malarkey."" The calls included the personal cell phone number of Kathy Sullivan, a former New Hampshire ballot law commissioner and New Hampshire Democratic Party chair. Sullivan called the robocall an attempt at election interference and requested an investigation. It was not clear how widely the audio call was circulated.       ‘I stand unwaveringly with President Donald Trump in the face of what I see as unprecedented and unfair treatment by certain judicial elements in New York,’ Elena Cardone wrote ‘Sadly, in our Country, Fake News is all you get!’ Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social We make it easy to make your photos shine.

,Trump vs. Biden: Do American voters want either?,"   Former U.S. President Donald Trump faces four criminal indictments: one in Florida over his handling of classified government documents after he left office, another in Washington for trying to overthrow the results of the 2020 presidential election, another in New York relating to his payment of hush money to a porn actress in the run-up to the 2016 election and an indictment in Georgia for conspiring to overturn the presidential election results in that state. In total, Trump has been indicted for committing 91 felonies. There is no evidence, however, that these indictments are weakening Trump’s support. To the contrary, with the issuance of each indictment his popularity as measured by public opinion polls has gone up. There are several reasons.  One is that hardcore Trump supporters are convinced that the indictments are just further evidence of how far the Democratic Party is prepared to go to use the Justice Department, the FBI and other organs of the “deep state” against Trump. To his supporters the extensive media reporting about Trump’s legal troubles is nothing other than proof of the mainstream media’s hostility toward the former president. With Trump’s die-hard supporters having already discounted evidence of his unethical behavior, it is hard to imagine anything that might be revealed about his actions that would so shock his supporters as to make many of them turn away from him. A lot of Trump supporters who disdain his personal behavior say they will vote for him anyway because they like his ""Make America Great Again"" policies or because they dislike the Democrats’ big government, big-spending ways or because they believe Washington has become a cesspool of corruption that requires radical surgery that only Trump has the courage to perform. Republican office holders are worried that Trump will lose if he runs and that Republican Party candidates for the House and Senate will go down to defeat with him. But they know that if they come out against Trump, the party's base will rise up in anger and use the primaries to deny his critics the GOP’s endorsement. The voting rate among average Americans in primaries is notoriously low. Primaries attract the participation of activists and the great majority of activists in the Republican Party are in the Trump camp. With each passing day it seems increasingly unlikely that Florida Gov. DeSantis or anyone else will pose a threat to Trump’s eventual nomination as the party’s candidate. DeSantis did not get the strong uptick in popular support from his performance at the first Republican debate this month that he needed to give new life to his lackluster campaign. For some on the stage, like the young Vivek Ramaswamy, the debate looked more like an audition to become Trump’s running mate. Short of facing a health crisis — not an insignificant concern for someone who is 77 years old, overweight, eats unhealthy food and doesn’t exercise — Trump is on track to be the GOP candidate in 2024. This is not to say that there has not been some erosion of his support. In a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist National poll, for example, 41% of respondents said that the former president has done nothing illegal, a number that is down from 50% in June. Even if that number continues to go down, however, it is hard to see how any other Republican could become popular enough to deny Trump the nomination. All a weakening of Trump support will do is hurt his chances of winning the general election, which is what the Democrats are hoping for and why Republican leaders are wary of criticizing him. Bad news for former President Trump should be good news for current President Joe Biden. Inflation and the unemployment rate are both coming down and the Chips Act and the Inflation Reduction Act are leading to much needed jobs, creating investment in infrastructure and in the building of new manufacturing plants. But the news for Biden, economic and otherwise, is not all good. In a New York Times/Siena poll published on Aug. 1, Biden and Trump were tied at 43% support. Biden’s numbers have not moved upward despite the improving economy in part because the moderating of inflation and the spurt of new capital investments have not yet caused average Americans to feel that their personal economic circumstances are getting better.               The world appears to have priced in former U.S. President Trump’s disdain not only for allies but the entire global order his predecessors created.

(AP Photo/Chris Szagola) BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said. But Lopez thinks messages of fear and Trump imperiling American democracy are essentially meaningless for many of the county’s working class voters. Their concern, he said, is finding steady work with good pay. “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

Georgia has two runoff elections on Tuesday that will decide control of the U.S. Senate and have a decisive influence on the ability of President-elect Joe Biden to advance his legislative agenda. Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg , Bloomberg (Bloomberg) -- President Joe Biden’s path to victory in Georgia, a key battleground in his reelection bid, is imperiled by lukewarm support from Black voters — the bloc that was crucial to his narrow triumph in the state in 2020. In the Atlanta metro area — home to the second-largest Black population in the US – Black residents said the pain of inflation and setbacks on policies such as student loan forgiveness have left them with misgivings about Biden’s candidacy.  The tepid sentiment is a vulnerability for the president in an election that will likely hinge on voter turnout in a handful of swing states. It highlights the risk that uninspired Black voters stay home or look to third-party alternatives. And it is a concerning signal for the Democratic Party, which has counted on Black voters for decades as a reliable part of its coalition but has recently seen a small erosion of support from this group, including in the 2022 midterm contests. A recent poll found less than one in five Black voters nationwide said they would feel enthusiastic about another four years of Biden. Billy Honor, organizing director at New Georgia Project, has observed that lack of excitement in his work in the state.  “Right now, they aren’t running and jumping that he is the candidate and would liked to have seen another voice,” Honor said. Economic Perceptions To make the case that Biden’s economic policy is delivering for Black voters, the White House has often highlighted economic data points such as record-low unemployment for Black Americans. But the jobless rate for this group has edged up since hitting that milestone in April. Meanwhile inflation — which has cooled recently after soaring to a four-decade high last year — continues to weigh heavily on perceptions of the health of the economy. “The cost of living is going up, and this is affecting everybody, but whenever the economy is bad for everybody, Black America feels it the worst,” said Bezaleel Jupiter, 23. Research has found that Black Americans, as well as Hispanic Americans, experienced higher rates of inflation last year than White Americans. At the same time, Biden has been hemmed in on certain initiatives that are especially important to Black voters. His student-debt relief program was blocked by the Supreme Court, and voting rights bills he has championed failed to pass the Senate. “There’s still a lot of things that he pandered to us as Black people that he’s gotten quiet on,” said Kenneth Harris II, a 32-year-old musician who lives in Southwest Atlanta. A vast majority of Black voters in Georgia, 88%, backed Biden in 2020, according to exit polling. While large swaths of that group remain solidly behind him, Biden can ill afford this frustration in a state where he edged out former President Donald Trump by less than a percentage point in 2020. That margin means even a small drop-off in support in 2024 could be detrimental. The GOP held onto the governor’s mansion in Georgia in 2022, offering a playbook for how the party can compete there next year. Perhaps more significant for Biden’s chances, though, is how many Black voters make a point to show up at the ballot box. Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes in 2020. With Black voters making up 32.9% of the electorate, Georgia’s 16 electoral votes would have gone the other way if less than 1% of Black voters had voted for Trump or simply stayed home. Mary Greene, a 63-year-old financial adviser who voted for Biden in 2020, said “Black people need to hold him accountable” for unfulfilled campaign pledges. “I’m not gonna vote Republican — that’s never gonna happen — but I will be thinking about who will get my vote based upon the promises that they intend to keep,” Greene said. Georgia Allies Democrats sacrificed one potential opportunity to excite the Georgia electorate: The party passed over Atlanta as the site for its 2024 nominating convention, opting instead for Chicago.  Nevertheless, the state appears to be a focal point for Biden. He has stacked his campaign with people who have deep familiarity with Georgia politics, including his principal deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, who steered Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock’s successful reelection bid in 2022. Michael Tyler, an Atlanta native who worked on the city’s failed bid to host the DNC convention, is communications director. Warnock and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens serve on Biden’s national advisory board. “Georgia is absolutely at the top of our list in terms of states that we need to hold,” Fulks said in an interview. The Biden campaign began running television ads in Atlanta in April. Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee bought digital ads and billboards on abortion rights in Georgia and five other battleground states in June. Georgia’s six-week abortion ban is among the strictest in the country. Democrats hope highlighting “extreme” policies embraced by their Republican opponents, on issues like reproductive rights and in a debate over Black history education in schools, will be persuasive to on-the-fence voters. ‘Closing the Margins’ Biden is likely to get a tailwind from the work of outside groups like New Georgia Project, a nonprofit that has registered more than 32,000 voters this year – many of them in densely populated areas that are Democratic bastions. “Elections these days as of late, and particularly in Georgia, have been won on the margins with a very, very small amount of voters,” says Kendra Cotton, the group’s chief executive officer. “We’re closing the margins.” Other groups, like Black Voters Matter and Fair Fight, are doing similar work in the state, many with the intention of combating voter suppression tactics that disproportionately affect Black voters. “We can be just as motivated as we were in 2020, hell, we can be just as motivated as we were in 2008 with Obama, but when you’ve got historic levels of voter suppression, then that same level of motivation and enthusiasm won’t show up the same,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter. The backdrop for these groups’ work may change later this month, when Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to announce charging decisions in a probe of efforts by Trump and his supporters to overturn the state’s election results. “He makes everybody want to vote,” Sharon Williams, a Democrat, said of Trump’s impact on turnout. --With assistance from Gregory Korte.

,Why This Group of Undecided Independent Voters Is Leaning Toward Trump,"What can President Biden say and do to win over undecided voters? What concerns and arguments will draw these voters to Donald Trump? For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we spoke with 13 undecided independent voters from across the country about how they see the two leading presidential candidates and explored some issues that might affect how they vote in November. To a striking degree, most of the participants tilted toward Mr. Trump, even though they disliked his personality. So why did they lean toward Mr. Trump? As you’ll read below, almost all the voters (who range in age from 22 to 64) were most worried about the economy and how their groceries and other bills were too costly. Some were also deeply troubled by the crisis at the southern border, and some were concerned about the Israel-Gaza war and disliked U.S. aid to other countries. The participants’ comments indicated that most did not feel they were in good hands with Mr. Biden or trust that they would be, using words like “senile,” “unfit” and “disingenuous” to describe him. And while the group viewed Mr. Trump negatively, some people suggested that the country was on its toes more with him in office. “At least Donald Trump started a conversation. Sure, it was divisive, and sure, it really wasn’t the most productive, but it really highlighted problems and the divisiveness that was already hidden inside of our country,” said Yalena, a 22-year-old Latina from Alabama. At the same time, she described experiencing more racism while Mr. Trump was president, including an ugly incident while dining out with her mother. These seeming contradictions came up with other matters as well; there was concern about the future of abortion rights yet skepticism that Mr. Biden or Mr. Trump would be any different on the issue. Many didn’t seem to understand the Democratic president’s views on abortion. If there was one takeaway, it’s that Mr. Biden has his work cut out for him to win over these voters. Fill in the blank: When I think about how things are going in the country right now, I’m most worried about: blank. The economy. Education. Inflation. Economy. Economy. Economy. Foreign policy. My child’s future. Economy. Where the government’s money’s going. Affordable housing. Education. Division of people Tell me more about the economy. When you chose that word, what were you thinking about? Inflation, interest rates. We’ve gone through a very big change in what is considered normal for interest rates. And I worry about government spending. How long have you been concerned about these things? Probably since Covid, around when we started Covid stimulus. I feel the same way. Ever since Covid, I keep hearing the government say that things are getting better. I’d like to know who they’re asking, because I don’t see the economy getting better. I see us spending more money in our households, in the government. Here in New Hampshire, it’s never been this bad, ever. What specifically are you thinking about? Our daily living, our cost of living. They’re spending billions and billions of dollars on stuff that I don’t understand. Where is that going? It is atrocious that our money is not going to education, health care, equipping us to withstand future troubles. I’m now noticing that the housing prices are decreasing significantly each month. Houses that were priced $50,000 above are now really drastically cutting their prices, so we’re going in the right direction somewhat. Inflation got better. Stocks rebounded a bit. Prices stopped growing like crazy like it used to be a year ago. I can’t agree at all with Pavel. That may be his experience, and I hope it is. In the last few months I’ve seen prices going up 10 percent, 15 percent over the last price, week by week. I go to the grocery store with my budget, and now I have to eat even worse quality food. That’s all I can afford. How about gas? How are gas prices where you are? I think in the last week, the gas prices went up here. My thing is education. Cost of tuition and with three kids in college at once, it was a big ticket for me. The cost of the tuition keeps going up every year, and the kids come out of school with a lot of debt. So that loan forgiveness, where’s that? I’m currently in college. I wanted to get my master’s, but it’s like I’m never going to be able to afford it. Where is the government’s money going? It should be going toward stuff like education. I’m never going to see loan forgiveness. I just see myself in debt forever. It seems to me like businesses are sort of in cahoots to inflate prices intentionally. Covid kind of reshaped our norm. We kept interest rates pinned way too low for too long. And then the Covid stimulus. I know we needed to do something during Covid, but I don’t think it went into all the right hands. What’s the word that describes how you feel about the upcoming election? Lost. Disaster. Necessary. Stressed. Anxious. Are we allowed to curse or no? Bullshit. Anxiety. Worried. Indifferent. Ugh. Abyss. Concerned. Disaster Kim, tell me why you said “anxious.” Because, given where we are as a country, I don’t know how this is going to go. You may think the best person is going to win, and then a curveball is thrown. I’ve seen huge upsets before, and that makes me very anxious. If the wrong person gets into office, where are we going to go? I feel like for the first time in my lifetime, both parties don’t represent a majority of Americans’ interests and so it doesn’t really matter who wins it. Yeah. Like no matter who gets voted into office, I think our options suck either way, and I don’t really see any progress. I said “indifferent.” It comes from the same sentiment that everyone was sharing. None of the people that are in office remotely reach the standards of what the American people need for them to lead them. All these people have the same agenda. When you say no matter who it is, they’re going to have the same agenda, do you feel like both candidates or any potential candidate, they all have the same agenda as each other? I wouldn’t say the same agenda as each other, but I definitely would say that their best interest has never been the American people. Joe Biden and Donald Trump, they both had opportunities to show us that. Donald Trump did a better job. Joe Biden, I mean, I feel like I don’t have a president. Gary, you said “abyss.” Well, the first thing that came to my mind was a phrase from the Talking Heads: “same as it ever was.” And I think that’s what these other people are saying, too. We’re stuck. How so? It’s like we’re looking over the edge of a cliff. We might fall off, and we can’t see the bottom. We can’t see anything. Ken, tell me why “bullshit.” Ever since Barack Obama left office — whether you feel what he did was right or wrong or whether you feel indifferent, he had a vision for what he saw as the American dream and trajectory to be going. With Trump, we lost a shared vision of where we’re going. Now it’s so divisive, whether it’s social media or actual general media, there’s only the left side, the right side. There’s no clear path between the two to accomplish what everyone’s wanting to see happen. Richard, you said “necessary.” We do this every four years. You make your choice as best you can from the pool that’s out there. You’ve got two parties. And you go online, the platforms are on the websites of both parties. You can see what they want to do for the next four years, so that’s what we all should be looking at. To me, it’s less about the person. A couple of people said they’re concerned the candidates are not going in the direction that most people want to go in. What direction do you all want to go in? People want to stop seeing the debt ceiling climb and climb. We’re at $34 trillion. We want to be responsible with our fiscal spending. We want to see a net positive trajectory of how we’re tackling our debt. We’re sending money to Ukraine, Israel, what have you, but what about the things here? What we should be getting to is a more united people. Shouldn’t our focus be on our country right now? That’s the direction we should be taking. We’ve given enough to all the other countries to help them. We’re going down fast and hard. I’m going to give you a list of five issues: the economy, immigration and the border, abortion and abortion rights, protecting democracy, and the conflict between Israel and Gaza. So except for Ken, everyone has a hand up for the economy. Ken, what was your No. 1? Israel and Gaza. I served nine years in the U.S. Army, and I see that we’re getting closer and closer to World War III. But no one seems super concerned that we’re putting our nose in, and we’re getting attacked by Yemen and Iran, and we’re increasing our military power inside of the Middle East again. We’re scratching at the door between two, three superpowers. Folks who picked the economy, tell me why. I guess it’s a combination. The economy affects everything — housing, education. My main concern is big business and the increase of inflation. I’m not sure there’s a whole lot you can do about big businesses and what they do, since they control the politicians. I just feel that we’re headed to another 2008, which is going to be much worse than it was back then. I always think about it. I can appreciate a third party. I don’t think we’re there yet. Kennedy’s had some actual plans for housing infrastructure in the United States, how the government could potentially subsidize fair housing for the general populace. I would be more likely to vote for a third-party candidate if I knew that they had a better chance of actually winning. But it just feels like a wasted, throwaway vote. I feel the same way. It’s a wasted vote. Imagine someone was polling pretty high and actually could win the presidency — what would you want that person to do as president, a person who was not beholden to Democrats or Republicans? Get private money out of the government. Stop lobbying and having corporate dollars influence our election. Just reach across the aisle and stop this grandstanding nonsense. Just compromise. Come to the middle on some of this stuff. Let’s talk about Biden. How would you describe Biden as a person? I’m very young, so I’m going to say what a Gen Z person would say: He’s a little bit senile, and I do think if you can’t do the job, it’s time to step down. How would you describe him as a person? I want to say he means well, but it doesn’t look like it from what he does. Is there something that you’re thinking about? He promised student loan forgiveness, and that never happened. His intentions are good. But with the lobbyists and the big businesses controlling everything, there’s not much going to get done. So I was going to say “puppet.” That’s because I feel like he really tap-dances. I don’t know what he’s done. It just seems like he’s just throwing things out there to please almost anyone. The word that immediately came up was “disingenuous.” Nothing that is said really connects with me. I don’t feel like I’m being told the truth. I don’t feel like I’m being told anything upfront. I was just so disappointed — with the ounce of hope I had left — when we just started pouring money into the Israel conflict. I think he’s unfit for the presidency. A president should be the commander in chief. And he does not appear to be a capable commander in chief. What was it specifically that gave you that impression? To pull out from Afghanistan. That was not wise, and it was rushed. We’re still dealing with those repercussions today. The deal with Iran is not a good one. Now they have loads of cash. So that’s not great. Our ships are parked in the Mediterranean Sea outside Israel, and they’re just outside of Russia’s missiles. So they’re not going to be attacked, probably, but this is going to disrupt prices. It’s going to disrupt oil, energy. These are not smart decisions. What would you name as the biggest accomplishment of the Biden administration? The infrastructure bills that have been passing. I work in that sector, and so there’s a lot of money being pumped into it right now. Has he done anything? Because I haven’t seen it. I think his presidency has been very weak and divisive. But if there’s a positive, I would say the infrastructure as well. For me, economywise, nothing. But I appreciate his support of Ukraine. Yeah, nothing economywise. But he’s done a lot for racial diversity, in appointing Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. He has competent people on his staff. I just feel like some of the people that were in the previous president’s inner circle just were really people with questionable character. And the cap on prescription prices, I completely forgot about that one. So that helped a little bit. Is there any policy that President Biden championed or that you associate with him that had a direct impact in terms of helping you or hurting you personally? I would say the housing. My daughters — What has Biden himself done on housing that’s affected you personally? Nothing. And my daughter has nowhere to go because she needs an income of $3,000, $4,000 a month to get an apartment. So she ends up — she’ll be coming here now. OK. And you tie that back more to Biden than to Gov. Chris Sununu or any local politicians? Yes. I attribute it to him. He was with the economy and should have made improvements not just for our state. This is not just our state that’s having this problem. So he released oil from the U.S. reserve to help cut gas prices. That’s a double-edged sword. One, we have cheaper gasoline. But two, that strategic reserve is now not at the same level that it used to be. Think about what you want Biden to talk more about: lowering the cost of groceries and other things or securing the border and tougher immigration rules. I happen to live in a border state. It is not in the news right now, but what I have been hearing and seeing is a conflict between one state or a group of states now that agree with one state versus the federal government. And it’s not productive. It’s going to lead to a not great situation. Richard, is there anything specifically you’d like to hear Biden say or do on that front? I would like him to address that. What’s happening is he’s dealing behind the scenes with Texas and with the governor over there, and that is not productive. In fact, they’re using intimidation on the governor of Texas, and it’s just not productive. If he wants more votes, I think he should say something. I’m with Richard. What’s happening between Texas and the federal government is very dangerous and concerns me. It should not be happening in America. I’m not sure that our country can afford having so many immigrants in a year, if we can digest them, if our economy will be hurt more. I’m a little bit further removed from the immigration as Richard and Pavel are. The major concern in my area is children and families who are not able to afford basic groceries. I work in the public education sector. You have two-income households who cannot afford food. I hate to say it. I don’t understand how the milk went from one price to the other. How many of you want to hear more from Biden on abortion rights? [Nobody raises a hand.] How do you feel about that issue in the election? It’s the states. It’s not the president. I don’t want to hear Biden talking about my abortion. I hate to say, there’s bigger issues besides abortion right now. It’s already been solved. Leave it alone, like they said. For folks in many states, there are bans or partial bans on abortion, or bans are being discussed. Do people feel that it’s important to have a discussion about protecting abortion rights nationally? I mean, yeah, I definitely think it’s important that the states that do have the ban on them to have a conversation. Why are you dictating what a woman is going to do with her body? I just think we’ve allowed it to become this religious vitriol thing where we allow religion to have a say in our policies about health care, especially women’s health care. And I feel like we have not done a good enough job and the government hasn’t done a good enough job at defining abortion as health care. Abortion is not a religious belief, whatever you think. Church and state have done a poor job at staying separated. I’m tired of hearing about it. I mean, I hate to say it. They can do what they want, women. When they have been banned before, they’re going to get an abortion. So I don’t even know why it’s a topic of discussion. Why do you think it’s a topic of discussion? It’s a diversion. Anything to draw out there to get people on one side heated against the other, this is exactly what this is. I bet you we won’t hear any more about this after the election. Who’s doing the diversion? Is it Democrats or Republicans? Is it the Supreme Court? Is it Biden? Is it state government? Well, I don’t even know that it’s a person. I would have to say it would be a group that has a vested interest in control, more control. So we talked about Biden. Now we’re going to talk about Trump. How would you describe Trump as a person? Conceited. Egotistical Self-righteous. Narcissist Disastrous. Flamboyant. Irritating. I was just going to say “crazy.” What are some strengths that he has? He’s very bold, and he’s competitive. I mean, you can say that much about him. Ambitious. What were some of his accomplishments during his presidency? At least Donald Trump started a conversation. Sure, it was divisive, and sure, it really wasn’t the most productive, but it really highlighted problems and the divisiveness that was already hidden inside of our country. At least people were having conversations. At least everything felt more exposed and out there. Can you tell me what those things were that were exposed? Our border. The conversations weren’t productive, but they really brought up the very important subject of funding so people that want to come here legally are able to access us. The infrastructure to support that program has people waiting 15, 20 years to get a legal green card, and that’s just ridiculous. I mean, there needs to be something done about that. I think he really had our economy pushing in the right direction. What did he do to do that? What was the policy or thing that he did? I just saw the flow. It seemed to flow, like the gas or even your shopping or just about anything that mattered to us. It just kind of flowed. It had a better flow. And you got to understand, it’s coming from a person that, I’ve hated this man since I was about 17. I always thought he was a pig. OK? I do. I can’t stand the man. But I voted for him three times. The unemployment rate got down to around 3.5 percent at one point, the lowest in 50 years. And so that was extremely uplifting for many, many groups in the country all at the same time, which was really amazing. I’d never seen that before. Not even during Clinton. If you had to guess, what do you think the unemployment rate is right now? It’s 3.4 percent, isn’t it? Because you’re saying the unemployment rate was very low under Trump. Do you think it was lower then than — Well, I just saw the new jobs report that came out. It is very good. It is very good for the country. As of last month, January, wages did increase. But that was not without a lot of inflation prior to that, with a lot of job losses over the last three years. Other folks, what are Trump’s accomplishments as president? I don’t know the specific numbers, but he was trying to redirect a lot of the manufacturing back here and be less reliant on foreign sources, which I think would be overall good for our future. Not a popular opinion, but Trump did put a pause on student loan payments during the pandemic, and honestly, that actually allowed me to have zero student loan debt. When Trump was president, is there anything that he did as president that had an impact on you personally in a way that either helped you or hurt you? This may sound silly, but I experienced a lot more racism due to him being president. I am fair-skinned, so I don’t look very Hispanic to a lot of people. But a lot of the times I spoke Spanish, people felt the opportunity to be more vocal about their opinion on how they felt about Hispanic people and even to my mother at times. And so I think that was definitely a shock. I had never been in a situation like that, never encountered anyone that felt so emboldened to say something like that. Yalena, may I ask, could you give a specific example of something that happened to you? Yeah. So me and my mom, we were at a pizza restaurant, and the people in the booth next to us did not appreciate that we were speaking Spanish. They called the manager over, and the manager came over to us, and they were like, “Hey, if you can’t speak English, we’re going to have to ask you to leave.” As you can imagine, we left because we felt uncomfortable, and as we were leaving, it was followed up by comments of “Go back to your country,” “Speak English,” “You’re in America.” And so God knows what else they said. I’m so sorry that happened to you and your mom. Thank you for sharing it. Let’s shift gears a bit. Trump is facing 91 criminal indictments. He talks about them a lot. Do you think Trump is talking too much about these criminal indictments that he is facing? [Two participants raise their hands.] Anyone have thoughts about these indictments against Trump and how he talks about them? I don’t think it’s a witch hunt, as he calls it, and I think he violated certain laws. I mean, in even his personal stuff and his sexual abuse. I mean, I trust all those allegations. For anyone, if Trump is convicted in one of these trials, would it make you any more or less likely to vote for him if he’s the Republican nominee? To me, it doesn’t affect anything. His life, he puts it right out there. I’m sick of hearing it, but it’s him. So if I’m going to vote for him, that’s part of what I accept. Lorraine, if he was convicted in one of these cases, would it make you any more or less likely to vote for him? It wouldn’t. I’ve already formed my opinion regarding Trump, so it wouldn’t hurt or help my opinion. Trump talks a lot about the border, saying there’s an invasion underway and he would seal the border if he was re-elected and turn people back. What’s your reaction to how Trump talks about the border? Is he talking about the border too much, not enough, the right way, the wrong way? Yeah, I definitely think it’s an issue and it needs to be dealt with. For whatever reason, it wasn’t highlighted enough until probably more recently. But I think it’s dangerous that he’s — I think by and large, they’re people escaping a bad situation from the country they’re in. They’re not here to commit crimes. And I think it’s really dangerous that he’s drawing a straight line to everyone that’s doing that. We definitely need immigration reform. No doubt it’s a problem. But the way that he goes about it is just going to cause more chaos and violence. Immigration does need to be moderated and monitored. But for every one of those people that come in there, they’re not taking jobs. They’re creating them as well. So for every 20 people or every 500 people, whatever it is, nurses, doctors, policemen, firemen all get new jobs. So it’s not just going one direction. It’s not just hurting the country. Which do you want to hear more about from Trump? How good the economy was when he was in office as president or what he would do with the economy if he’s elected in November? For me at this point, anything Trump said, I don’t buy it at all. It’s a bunch of fluff, a bunch of lies. As far as the economy he’s built, to me, he never built the economy. He just basically piggybacked off what Obama and Joe Biden had done prior to his administration. The only thing he’s really done that I can see significantly is give a big tax cut to the big businesses. I did vote for him in 2016, but I am greatly disappointed. I just think he’s just going to use it as an opportunity to enrich himself. That’s ultimately what it comes down to. He only cares about one person: himself. Last question from me. So what advice would you give to Biden to try to get more undecided voters to vote for him? I don’t know what he could say, in my opinion, just because we’ve been a disaster since he’s been there. Take a look at what’s happening with the economy. Look at it for real with your eyes and not all your people around you. I agree with Robin. I think he’s controlled. I think he needs to be more of his own mind and speak freely more from himself. I think more heartfelt as a person. I don’t get that from him. I mean, he’s not inspiring at all. There’s not much you could basically tell him other than just come up with great policies for the country. I’d just tell him to stop messing around and just shoot me straight with what his intentions are. What’s the thing that you feel he’s not being straight on? Just their plans on what they’re trying to accomplish in office. I feel like I was promised a lot. Natalie shared student loan forgiveness, and lo and behold, it’s not here. Why do you think that’s happened? What’s your sense of what happened with student loans? I’m not so sure, I just know that it didn’t happen. But when I see billions of dollars going across the sea, I’m like, “Well, I could have used a couple of those billion dollars to clear my $15,000 of student loan debt.” What advice would you give to Trump? What could he say or do? Stay off Twitter. Between both of them, have a plan, communicate the plan, prioritize and execute. Make sure everyone knows what’s going on. Do those, you’ll be all right. He’s just going to have to tone it down some. He’s got to — hate to say it — win back some people that he lost. So he’s going to need to tone it down and kind of rebuild those tainted relationships he did last go-round. How do you think he could do that? So I know he tried in some terrible ways, but he’s going to need a P.R. person to really help him reconnect with the populations that he divided and upset. I don’t want to just hear Kanye back at the White House. That’s not going to fix it or solve anything. Just stop being so ridiculous. I mean, he’s not presidential at all. Just get down to business.

,Democrats worry their most loyal voters won’t turn out for Biden in 2024,"Democrats are worried about a potential drop next year in turnout among Black voters, the party’s most loyal constituency, who played a consequential role in delivering the White House to President Biden in 2020 and will be crucial in his bid for reelection. Their concern stems from a 10 percentage-point decline in Black voter turnout in last year’s midterms compared with 2018, a bigger drop than among any other racial or ethnic group, according to a Washington Post analysis of the Census Bureau’s turnout survey. Such warning signals were initially papered over by other Democratic successes in 2022: The party picked up a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania, Sen. Raphael G. Warnock won reelection in Georgia and anticipated losses in the House were minimal. Subscribe to comment and get the full experience.

,Biden wants to win over young voters. They want him to do more about climate change,"Mara Liasson President Biden is grappling with how to convince young voters to support him. Climate and the pushback around him skipping COP28 is one example.  JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to the international climate summit known as COP28 in Dubai this weekend. The White House says President Joe Biden asked Harris to go to emphasize the importance of the conference and to showcase U.S. leadership on climate at home and abroad. But young people in particular have been pushing Biden to do more when it comes to climate. They have been calling for Biden himself to attend the global meeting. Here to talk about the politics around all of this is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Juana. SUMMERS: So Mara, why is the question of who will attend this summit so significant? LIASSON: Well, first of all, the purpose of the summit is to see if these big fossil fuel-consuming countries can meet their promises to keep the Earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Politically, who goes for the United States is important because this is an example of the difficulty Biden has had with young voters. Young people care very deeply about climate, about the state of the Earth that they're going to inherit, and the White House was feeling the pressure. A source familiar with the plans to send the vice president told our colleague Deepa Shivaram that that pressure made them decide to send Vice President Harris. So climate was a big part of Biden's campaign for president in 2020. He's taken some big actions related to climate change since then. He's in Colorado today actually talking about wind power. The Inflation Reduction Act that he signed put huge investments into climate policy - $370 billion. He doesn't get a whole lot of credit for that. But young voters want him to do more. They want him to solve problems and not just on climate. They want the high cost of housing addressed. They want the Israeli-Hamas war to be ended. They want student loan forgiveness. And they're frustrated that Biden can't do more. SUMMERS: I want to stick with the war here for a second because that is an area that has been another really big disconnect between the administration and young voters, right? LIASSON: Absolutely. The war in the Middle East is a motivating issue for young voters, young people right now. This is one place where Biden and young people pushing for an end to Israel's military actions are actually at odds. On climate, they agree. They just think Biden should be doing more. The Middle East is where there is a real policy difference between young voters, between voters of color - very important parts of the Democratic base - and the Biden administration. Whether this issue will hurt Biden next year depends on how long the Hamas-Israeli war lasts. But right now, it's showing some deep rifts inside the Democratic Party which could be a real problem for Biden. Now, climate is not going away. It's going to be an issue now. It's going to be an issue next year. We'll have to see how big of an impact it has on motivating young people to either vote for Biden, stay home or find a third party alternative. SUMMERS: OK, back to the summit. Vice President Harris is going to go. What has her role been in engaging with these young voters that the administration needs? LIASSON: The White House has used her as an ambassador to young voters, to the Democratic base, on a whole lot of issues. She's gone on the road. She's talked on college campuses about climate change, about abortion, about gun laws. It hasn't all been smooth for her. At one of her last stops, protesters were shouting about the administration's approach to Gaza. But it's just not clear if Harris is going to be the person to galvanize the youth vote. SUMMERS: I mean, young people were a huge part of the Biden coalition in 2020, as you know well. What does it mean in 2024 if they do not show up and vote?

,Don’t Fall for the Third-Party Trick,"ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally on Jan. 21, 2024 in Rochester, N.H. AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS are binary. Either a Democrat or a Republican wins. Nobody else. The 2024 presidential election will be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. No matter how much Americans may wish for other candidates, that’s the choice. Third-party candidates don’t win, can’t win; they only steal votes from the mainstream Republican or Democratic candidate with whom they are most closely aligned. They help the candidate at the opposite end of the political spectrum. This year, progressives who vote for a third-party candidate, or don’t vote at all, are really voting for Trump. In 1992, Ross Perot ran one of the most significant third-party campaigns in American history, winning nearly 20 percent of the vote. The Dallas entrepreneur campaigned as a folksy populist conservative, a slightly crazy-sounding fiscal and trade hawk with a billionaire business resume — sort of a precursor to Trump but without the racism, fascism, and criminality. Perot took millions of votes from disaffected Republicans angered by President George H.W. Bush’s willingness to compromise with congressional Democrats on taxes. When Bush ran for president in 1988, one of his key campaign pledges had been not to raise taxes; his reversal once he was in office fueled Perot’s rise. Perot’s strong showing in 1992 ensured the election of Bill Clinton, returning the Democrats to the White House for the first time since Jimmy Carter. I covered Ross Perot’s 1992 campaign for the Los Angeles Times, and the experience convinced me that third-party candidates launch what they know are futile presidential bids to satisfy their egos or because they harbor grudges against one of the major candidates and hope to damage their campaigns. In Perot’s case, it was both. He had a massive ego. I saw that side of him during one interview over lunch, when I challenged one of his false assertions about his business background. Perot stared at me in fury and then took out his wallet, slammed it on the table, and loudly said that he would bet all the money in it that he was right. I laughed and told him that I didn’t have as much money as he did.   Another key driving factor for Perot was his bitter hatred of Bush and the Bush family, who he saw as rich northern carpetbaggers and not real Texans. Throughout the campaign, Perot spouted strange conspiracy theories about Bush and other Republican officials. Perot ended his presidential bid abruptly in July 1992, just when he was starting to come under real scrutiny. He weirdly restarted his campaign in October, in time to join the televised presidential debates. At almost every turn, Perot’s actions helped Clinton; he quit the race just as the successful Democratic National Convention in New York was ending, stunning the nation and solidifying Clinton’s standing as the only alternative to Bush. When Perot got back into the race in October, he kept Bush from regaining momentum. Perot ran again in 1996 with less success, but still hurt Republican nominee Bob Dole. None of the third-party candidates this year are likely to come close to Perot’s 1992 vote total, but it is possible that a combination of left-wing votes for third-party candidates and low voter turnout among young progressives because of an antipathy to Biden could damage the Democratic incumbent in a handful of critical states and doom his reelection bid. That would put Trump back in the White House. So, just to be clear: A progressive who doesn’t vote, or who votes in the general election for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Cornel West or Jill Stein — or whoever No Labels puts up as a candidate — is voting for Donald Trump. A Trump presidency means the return of a vengeful maniac to the White House, determined to destroy anyone who gets in the way of his lust for power and ambition to become an American dictator. It means the ascendancy of a deranged MAGA Republican agenda, more vicious and poisonous than ever before, an agenda that will usher in a dark age for the United States. That agenda would likely bring major wars abroad and cultural fundamentalism at home. MAGA-world wants wars with China and Mexico. Trump and his backers would undoubtedly support the complete Israeli takeover of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and the dislocation of millions of Palestinians. He would endorse a Russian victory by cutting off U.S. aid to Ukraine; a U.S. withdrawal from Europe would likely follow, along with a Russian invasion of the Baltic states. Despite acknowledging that it would be bad politics, Trump would almost certainly support a complete, nationwide ban on abortion and probably also endorse Christian fundamentalist demands to ban contraceptives, along with nationwide book bans. His aides are already on record calling for the creation of concentration camps for immigrants, while he has made it clear he wants to prosecute and imprison his political opponents, journalists, and other dissidents. As president, he would name hundreds of more judges who would eagerly bring about the end of voting rights for minorities. And of course, Trump would pick up where he left off during his last term and loot the government’s coffers. The twice-impeached, four-times-indicted Trump is already vowing to politicize the Justice Department to escape his myriad legal troubles. America will be subjected to a government in the thrall of White Christian nationalists, who don’t believe in the separation of church and state. Above all, Trump is clearly unfit for the presidency, or any leadership role. He constantly spews threats and hate on social media. Many of his former advisers now agree that he shouldn’t be in a position to give orders to the U.S. national security apparatus. They are right. Trump poses an existential danger to the United States. Progressives should not make the same mistake that Ernst Thälmann made in 1932. The leader of the German Communist Party, Thälmann saw mainstream liberals as his enemies, and so the center and left never joined forces against the Nazis. Thälmann famously said that “some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest” of social democrats, whom he sneeringly called “social fascists.” After Adolf Hitler gained power in 1933, Thälmann was arrested. He was shot on Hitler’s orders in Buchenwald concentration camp in 1944.

Gary Fields | Associated Press,Saving democracy is central to Biden’s campaign messaging. Will it resonate with swing state voters?,"Storage Preferences
Third Parties        Today's e-Edition TRENDING: BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Just blocks from the shuttered Bethlehem Steel plant, the Hispanic Center Lehigh Valley was bustling on a recent day with scores of older people eating lunch. Downstairs, out of sight, a constant stream of visitors was shopping in its massive food pantry. Over the past seven months, the number visitors to the pantry has risen by more than a third. The center’s executive director, Raymond Santiago, sees that as a stark sign of something he has felt over the past couple years: Many in the area’s Latino community are struggling to meet their basic needs. Northampton County, which includes Bethlehem, is a traditional bellwether for Pennsylvania, one of the most important presidential swing states, and Latinos are a key part of the coalition that President Joe Biden is trying rebuild as he embarks on his campaign for a second term. In doing so, the Democrat might have challenges selling a crucial part of his reelection strategy. One of the messages he has delivered in previous visits to Pennsylvania is that former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is a danger to American democracy. Biden is hoping that message energizes the same voters who turned out four years ago, when Northampton County narrowly flipped to him after supporting Trump by a thin margin in 2016. Based on his interactions with visitors to the Hispanic center, Santiago isn’t so sure. It’s the price of groceries and lack of affordable housing that dominate conversations there. “I think so many people are already immune to that messaging, it won’t land as cleanly this election as it did in 2020,” he said. “If he keeps pushing that message, it might turn voters away.” Biden chose a location near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, with its deep symbolism for the country’s struggle for freedom, for his initial campaign event for 2024, portraying Trump as a grave threat to America and describing the general election as “all about” whether democracy can survive. It was a message similar to one he gave before the 2022 midterm elections at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where the nation’s founding documents were created. Biden warned that Trump and his followers threatened “the very foundation of our republic.” Biden has continued the theme during the early primary season, telling supporters winning a second term is essential for maintaining the country’s democratic traditions. Over the course of several days, The Associated Press interviewed a cross section of voters in Northampton County to ask whether Biden’s messaging around the fate of democracy was resonating. These voters represented parts of the very coalition Biden will need to win Pennsylvania again — Black voters, Latinos, independents and moderates from both parties. Their overarching response: The president’s warning that a second Trump presidency will shred constitutional norms and destroy democratic institutions is not one that, alone, will motivate them and get them out to vote. Like people across much of the rest of the country, most of those interviewed would prefer avoiding a rematch of the 2020 contest, and several suggested they would seriously consider a serious third-party candidate with a strong message and a chance of winning. Evelyn Fermin, 74, who regularly visits the Lehigh Hispanic center, has lived in the county for two years after spending most of her life in New Jersey. Her opinion about Trump has been set since Jan. 6, 2021, when the former president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent bid to stop Congress from certifying Biden’s win. But she doesn’t think reminders of that day will be sufficient to persuade voters in November. For the daughter of parents who immigrated from the Dominican Republic, her concerns are border security and spending abroad. “Rather than sending it out to foreign countries, I think we should use it for our people,” she said. As a divorced mother who supported her son as he worked his way through school to become a lawyer, she also doesn’t support Biden’s attempt to waive student loan debt: “If I was able to to do it, I feel that they should.” Curt Balch, 44, worked in the health care industry and is now a stay-at-home dad. He was weathering a two-hour school delay with his 5-year-old daughter in his home in Hellertown, in a more rural part of the county. He registered Republican so he could vote in primaries, but describes himself as more libertarian. Balch said the messaging by both sides is “pretty toxic” when they warn that the other is “a threat or a danger to the fundamentals of the country moving forward.” He supported Trump in the past two elections but is open to considering other candidates this year, especially if he thinks there is an appealing third-party or independent candidate. Balch believes the dire warnings about a potential second Trump term are overblown. Balch notes that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump let states decide for themselves how to handle it. “I understand the rhetoric, ‘Oh, he’s going to be a fascist dictator,’” Balch said. “I don’t think it’s a message that’s getting people to the polls. I don’t think people are legitimately thinking that they need to be afraid of Donald Trump.” Christian Miller was a lifelong Democrat but became an independent in 2022 out of frustration with political gridlock and a sense that as he got older, he was growing more conservative. He said he might one day consider switching to the Republican Party, but not as long as Trump is leading it. That’s not out of any worry that Trump would become a dictator if he wins a second term. “I don’t know that I fear it as much as it’s being made out to be in the media from either side,” said Miller, a 53-year-old bank executive who lives in Nazareth. “I feel that the institutions are safe and and are strong enough to withstand the challenges.” Miller cited the dozens of failed court challenges seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential results by Trump and his allies as an example of the institutions holding firm. Surveys indicate concern about the state of democracy, but it’s not clear how that will translate in November’s election. A Biden campaign spokesperson said the democracy message is central to the campaign but it is not the only one the campaign will use to reach voters. Protecting abortion rights and fighting for higher wages will be among the issues essential to the president’s pitch. Northampton County, especially Bethlehem, has been slowly emerging from the economic shock that followed the collapse of the local steel industry. The plant produced the steel that built the Golden Gate Bridge during the Great Depression and a decade later, during World War II, became the country’s largest shipbuilder. The blast furnaces, which fell silent nearly 30 years ago, are still visible for miles as they sit alongside the Lehigh River. But Bethlehem has been enjoying a revival in recent years as it has evolved into a hub for health care and technology companies. New shops, an art center, museum, performing arts stage and a casino, among other developments, have added vibrancy to a picturesque city dotted with historical structures dating to the 18th century. Northampton also is a historical bellwether. As the county has gone in the presidential election, so has the state, said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg University in Allentown. The last time they split was 1948, when the county voted for Democrat Harry Truman but the state went for Republican Thomas Dewey. “It’s about as great a benchmark county as you’ll ever find,” Borick said. Biden narrowly carried the county in 2020, four years after Trump had narrowly prevailed in his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Anna Kodama, 69, is the type of voter who traditionally has swung back and forth between the parties. She grew up in a Republican household in Ohio but switched parties during college. She recalls voting across party lines frequently since she moved to the Lehigh Valley in 1977 — until 2016 when Trump was making his first run for the presidency and she voted a straight ticket for Democrats. The people Kodama encounters are not listening to Biden’s messages about a dark future under Trump. Instead, she would like him to speak more about what he is doing to improve the economy and forge stronger ties with Europe. She paid attention to a Biden visit earlier this year to a nearby town, Emmaus, where he stopped at local stores to discuss the importance of supporting small businesses. She said Biden seems to connect better with people when he promotes a positive message, rather than a negative one that she believes will not motivate people in the fall. “That’s where I find it compelling — look what we can do together,” said the artist and former teacher who was sipping coffee at Café the Lodge in Bethlehem. “That message resonates with me and with people I know.” For Esther Lee, the 90-year-old president of the local NAACP, the threat-to-democracy message is not generating much concern among the people she contacts. She already plans to vote, but not because she is fearful of another Trump presidency. “We already know who he is,” she said. Getting Black voters engaged is going to take more from Biden, she believes, because so far his campaign messages have not resonated. She questions whether the Black community in Northampton County is the target audience: “I’m not seeing evidence of it,” she said. Lee said the issue she hears about most in her circle is homelessness: “It’s No. 1,” she said, adding that the resources don’t seem to be sufficient to address the local problem. The companion to that, she said, is affordable housing. “With Biden’s campaign, they need to reach down further,” with the messaging, she said. At the Lehigh center, Guillermo Lopez Jr., 69, recalls his deep ties to the area and the many members of his extended family who worked at Bethlehem Steel. He worked at the plant for 27 years, following a father who worked there for 36. He is now on the center’s board of directors and a local leader in the Latino community. A Democrat who said he leans independent, he plans to vote for Biden in part because of how he thought Trump’s rhetoric, beginning with is campaign announcement in 2015, made targets of Latinos and other minorities. “It just speaks to me that there’s so much misguided hatred toward people like me,” he said.   “I actually think that harms the vote,” he said of the democracy warnings. The average person who “just puts their nose to the grindstone and goes to work, I don’t think that motivates them. I think it scares them and freezes them.” The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

"November 7, several prominent Republicans had publicly denounced Trump's claims of electoral fraud, saying they were unsubstantiated, baseless or without evidence, damaging to the election process, undermining democracy and dangerous to political stability while others supported his demand of transparency.[421] According to CNN, people close to Donald Trump, such as his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and his wife Melania Trump, urged him to accept his defeat. While Donald Trump privately acknowledged the outcome of the presidential election, he nonetheless encouraged his legal team to continue pursuing legal challenges.[422] Trump expected to win the election in Arizona, but when Fox News declared Biden the victor of the state, Trump became furious and claimed the result was due to fraud.[423] Trump and his allies suffered approximately 50 legal losses in four weeks after starting their litigation.[424] In view of these legal defeats, Trump began to employ ""a public pressure campaign on state and local Republican officials to manipulate the electoral system on his behalf"".[423][425][426][427]",2020 United States presidential election," Donald Trump
Republican Joe Biden
Democratic The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.[a] The Democratic ticket of former vice president Joe Biden and the junior U.S. senator from California Kamala Harris defeated the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence.[9] The election took place against the backdrop of the global COVID-19 pandemic and related recession. The election saw the highest voter turnout by percentage since 1900, with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008. Biden received more than 81 million votes,[10] the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a U.S. presidential election.[11] In a competitive primary that featured the most candidates for any political party in the modern era of American politics, Biden secured the Democratic presidential nomination over his closest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders. Biden's running mate, Harris, became the first African-American, first Asian-American, and third female[d] vice presidential nominee on a major party ticket. Trump secured re-nomination, getting a total of 2,549 delegates, one of the most in presidential primary history, to runner-up Bill Weld's one delegate in the Republican primaries.[12] Jo Jorgensen secured the Libertarian presidential nomination with Spike Cohen as her running mate, and Howie Hawkins secured the Green presidential nomination with Angela Nicole Walker as his running mate. The central issues of the election included the public health and economic impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; civil unrest in reaction to the police murder of George Floyd and others; the Supreme Court following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett; and the future of the Affordable Care Act.[13][14][15] Due to the ongoing pandemic, a record number of ballots were cast early and by mail.[16] Many more registered Democrats voted by mail than registered Republicans.[17][18] As a result of a large number of mail-in ballots, some swing states saw delays in vote counting and reporting; this led to major news outlets delaying their projection of Biden and Harris as the president-elect and vice president-elect until the morning of November 7, three and a half days after the election. Major media networks project a state for a candidate once there is high statistical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning that state.[19] Biden ultimately received the majority in the Electoral College with 306 electoral votes, while Trump received 232. Key to Biden's victory were his wins in the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which Trump carried in 2016 and whose combined 46 electoral votes were enough to swing the election to either candidate. Biden also became the first Democrat to win a presidential election in Georgia since 1992, in Arizona since 1996, and in Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since 2008.[20][21] Before, during, and after Election Day, Trump and numerous other Republicans engaged in an aggressive and unprecedented[22][23][24][25][26] attempt to subvert the election and overturn the results,[27] falsely alleging widespread voter fraud and trying to influence the vote-counting process in swing states,[28][29][30][31] in what was described by many as an attempted coup d'état. Attorney General William Barr and officials in each of the 50 states found no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularities in the election.[32][33] Federal agencies overseeing election security said it was the most secure in American history.[34][35][36] The Trump campaign and its allies, including Republican members of Congress,[37] continued to engage in numerous attempts to overturn the results of the election by filing numerous lawsuits in several states (most of which were withdrawn or dismissed),[38][39][40] spreading conspiracy theories alleging fraud,[41] pressuring Republican state election officials (including, notably, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in a phone call that later became widely publicized) and legislators to change results,[42] pressuring the Department of Justice to declare the election ""corrupt"" and intervene,[43][44] objecting to the Electoral College certification in Congress,[45][46] and refusing to cooperate with the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[47] With Trump vowing that he would never concede the election and after exhorting his followers to ""fight like hell"", a mob of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, during the joint session of Congress held to certify the Electoral College count.[48][49][50] On January 7, Trump acknowledged the incoming administration without mentioning Biden's name.[51][52][53] Biden and Harris were inaugurated on January 20, 2021; in a break from tradition, Trump did not attend his successor's inauguration.[54] Trump was indicted on August 1, 2023, on four counts relating to conspiring to overturn the results. Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the various political parties in the United States. Each party develops a method (such as a primary election) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. Primary elections are usually indirect elections where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that party's ticket, which is then ratified by the delegates at the party's convention (except for the Libertarian Party, which nominates its vice-presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.[55] If no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election, the United States House of Representatives will select the president from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the United States Senate will select the vice president from among the candidates who received the two highest totals. The presidential election occurred simultaneously alongside elections for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and various state and local-level elections.[56] The Maine Legislature passed a bill in August 2019 adopting ranked-choice voting (RCV) both for presidential primaries and for the general election.[57][58] Governor Janet Mills allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed its taking effect until after the 2020 Democratic primary in March and made Maine the first state to use RCV for a presidential general election. The Maine Republican Party filed signatures for a veto referendum to preclude the use of RCV for the 2020 election, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap found there were insufficient valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. A challenge in Maine Superior Court was successful for the Maine Republican Party, but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court[59][60] stayed the ruling pending appeal on September 8, 2020.[61] Nevertheless, ballots began being printed later that day without the veto referendum and including RCV for the presidential election,[62][63] and the Court ruled in favor of the secretary of state on September 22, allowing RCV to be used.[64] An emergency appeal to the Supreme Court was denied on October 6.[65] The law continues the use of the congressional district method for the allocation of Maine's electors (Nebraska is the only other state that apportions its electoral votes this way).[66] While multiple rounds of vote counting were not needed due to a single candidate receiving a majority of first-choice votes statewide and in each district, use of RCV complicates interpretation of the national popular vote because voters are more likely to vote for third-party or independent candidates.[67] On December 14, 2020, pledged electors for each candidate, known collectively as the United States Electoral College, gathered in their states' capitols to cast their official votes. Pursuant to the processes laid out by the Electoral Count Act of 1887, certificates of ascertainment listing the names of the electors and separate certificates recording their votes are distributed to various officials across the branches of government.[68][69][70] The newly elected Congress, with the Vice President in his role as Senate President presiding, met in a joint session to formally open the certificates and count the votes, which began on January 6, 2021, was interrupted by the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and finished the following day.[71] The presidential election occurred simultaneously with elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives. Gubernatorial and legislative elections were also held in several states. For the subsequent election, the apportionment of House seats among the 50 states based on the results of the 2020 United States census occurred, and the states conducted redistricting of congressional and state legislative districts. In most states, the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting, although some states have redistricting commissions. Often, a party that wins a presidential election experiences a coattail effect that also helps other candidates of that party win elections.[72] The party that won the 2020 presidential election could have also won a significant advantage in drawing new congressional and state legislative districts, which would stay in effect until 2032.[73]    Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party on June 5, 2020, when he secured enough delegates to ensure his nomination at the national convention.[74] He was formally nominated at the convention on August 18.[75]   Every incumbent president seeking another term, with the partial exception of Lyndon Johnson in 1968,[76] has been renominated by their party since 1884.[77] Donald Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, were able to easily secure the nomination after receiving enough delegates in the 2020 Republican presidential primaries.[78][79] Jo Jorgensen, who was the running mate of author Harry Browne in 1996, received the Libertarian nomination at the national convention on May 23, 2020.[80] She achieved ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.[81] Howie Hawkins became the presumptive nominee of the Green Party on June 21, 2020, and was officially nominated by the party on July 11, 2020.[82][83] Hawkins secured ballot access in 29 states and the District of Columbia, representing 381 electoral votes, and write-in access in 16 more states, representing 130 electoral votes.[84][85][e] The 2020 Democratic National Convention was originally scheduled for July 13–16 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,[88][89][90] but was delayed to August 17–20 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[91] On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention would be held in a mixed online in-person format, with most delegates attending remotely but a few still attending the physical convention site.[92] On August 5, the in-person portion of the convention was scaled down even further; major speeches, including Biden's, were switched to a virtual format.[93] The 2020 Republican National Convention took place from August 24–27 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and various remote locations. Originally, a three-day convention was planned to be held in North Carolina, but due to North Carolina's insistence that the convention follow COVID-19 social distancing rules, the speeches and celebrations were moved to Jacksonville, Florida (official convention business was still contractually obligated to be conducted in Charlotte).[94][95] Due to the worsening situation with regards to COVID-19 in Florida, the plans there were cancelled, and the convention was moved back to Charlotte in a scaled-down capacity.[96] The 2020 Libertarian National Convention was originally scheduled to be held in Austin, Texas, over Memorial Day weekend from May 22 to 25,[97][98] but all reservations at the JW Marriott Downtown Austin for the convention were cancelled on April 26 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[99] The Libertarian National Committee eventually decided the party would hold two conventions, one online from May 22–24 to select the presidential and vice-presidential nominees and one at a physical convention in Orlando, Florida, from July 8–12 for other business.[100] The 2020 Green National Convention was originally to be held in Detroit, Michigan, from July 9 to 12.[90] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the convention was instead held online, without a change in date.[101] The House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts on December 18, 2019.[102] The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,[103] and ended on February 5, resulting in acquittal by the United States Senate.[104] This is the second time a president has been impeached during his first term while running for a second term.[105][i] Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.[107][108] This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.[109] The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.[110][111] Several events related to the 2020 presidential election were altered or postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and its effects, such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines by local governments. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.[112][113] On March 12, Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.[114] The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the CNN studios in Washington, D.C.[115] Several states also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,[116] Kentucky,[117] Louisiana,[118] Ohio,[119] and Maryland.[120] As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates had halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over COVID-19 concerns. Political analysts speculated at the time that the moratorium on traditional campaigning, coupled with the effects of the pandemic on the nation, could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.[121][122][123] Some presidential primary elections were severely disrupted by COVID-19-related issues, including long lines at polling places, greatly increased requests for absentee ballots, and technology issues.[124] Due to a shortage of election workers able or willing to work during the pandemic, the number of polling places was often greatly reduced. Most states expanded or encouraged voting by mail as an alternative, but many voters complained that they never received the absentee ballots they had requested.[125] The March 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act included money for states to increase mail-in voting. By May, Trump and his campaign strongly opposed mail-in voting, claiming that it would cause widespread voter fraud, a belief that has been discredited by a number of media organizations.[126][127] Government response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled with the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding economic stimulus, became a major campaign issue for both parties.[128][129] On April 6, the Supreme Court and Republicans in the State Legislature of Wisconsin rebuffed Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers's request to move the state's spring elections to June. As a result, the elections, which included a presidential primary, went ahead on April 7 as planned.[130] At least seven new cases of COVID-19 were traced to this election. Voting-rights advocates expressed fear of similar chaos on a nationwide scale in November, recommending states move to expand vote-by-mail options.[131] On June 20, 2020, Trump's campaign held an in-person rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that the event could go ahead despite continuing concerns over COVID-19.[132] Attendance at the rally was far lower than expected, being described as a ""flop"", and it led to a significant worsening of relations between Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale.[133] 7.7 million people watched the event on Fox News, a Saturday audience record for that channel.[134] Three weeks after the rally, the Oklahoma State Department of Health recorded record numbers of cases of COVID-19,[135] and former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain died of the virus, although it was not confirmed that he caught the disease due to his attendance at the rally.[136] On October 2, 2020, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 following a positive test from his senior advisor, Hope Hicks, as part of the larger COVID-19 outbreak among White House personnel. Both the president and first lady immediately entered quarantine, which prevented Trump from further campaigning, notably at campaign rallies.[137][138][139] Later that day, the President was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center with a low grade fever, where he was reported to have received an experimental antibody treatment.[140][141] Trump's diagnosis came only two days after he had shared the stage with Biden at the first presidential debate and raised the possibility that Biden had caught the virus from Trump; Biden tested negative.[142][143] Trump was discharged from the hospital on October 5.[144] Trump being diagnosed with COVID-19 was widely seen as having a negative effect on his campaign and shifted the attention of the public back onto COVID-19, an issue which is generally seen as a liability for Trump, due to his response to the COVID-19 pandemic suffering from low approval ratings.[145][146] Being in quarantine also meant Trump was unable to attend rallies, which were a major part of his campaign. As a result of Trump contracting COVID-19, Biden continued campaigning but temporarily ceased running attack ads against him.[147][148] On October 12, one week after his discharge from the hospital, Trump resumed in-person rallies.[144] Trump continued to travel to battleground states and hold mass rallies, sometimes two or three in a day. His rallies were criticized for their lack of social distancing or mask wearing, and some polls suggested that voters saw him less favorably for potentially endangering attendees.[149][150] U.S. officials accused Russia, China, and Iran of trying to influence the 2020 United States elections.[151][152] On October 4, 2019, Microsoft announced that ""Phosphorus"", a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government, had attempted to compromise e-mail accounts belonging to journalists, U.S. government officials and the campaign of a U.S. presidential candidate.[153][154] The American Government owned Voice of America reported in April 2020 that ""Internet security researchers say there have already been signs that China-allied hackers have engaged in so-called 'spear-phishing' attacks on American political targets ahead of the 2020 vote."" Chinese spokesman Geng Shuang denied the allegations and said he would ""hope the people of the U.S. not drag China into its electoral politics"".[155] On February 13, 2020, American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump re-elected.[156][157] The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. On February 21, The Washington Post reported that, according to unnamed U.S. officials, Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders issued a statement after the news report, saying in part, ""I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear: stay out of American elections, and as president, I will make sure that you do.""[158] Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia's alleged efforts about a month prior.[159] In a February 2020 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. intelligence officials warned Congress that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to support Trump's reelection campaign; Trump was angered that Congress had been informed of the threat, and the day after the briefing castigated the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, for allowing the briefing to go forward.[160][161] China and some government-linked Chinese individuals have been accused of interfering in the election to support the candidacy of both Biden and Trump,[162] though whether it is actually doing so is disputed among the intelligence community.[161][163] On October 21, threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states. The emails warned, ""You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you.""[164] Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails, using a spoofed return address, had been sent by Iran. He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data, possibly from publicly available information, and ""This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion, sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy."" A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation.[165] In his announcement, Ratcliffe said Iran's intent had been ""to intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump"", raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump. It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe's prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage; he had added it on his own.[166] On November 18, 2021, the Justice Department charged two Iranian hackers with attempting to intimidate American voters ahead of the 2020 U.S. election by sending threatening emails and spreading false information.[167] Throughout the election period, several Colombian lawmakers and the Colombian ambassador to the United States issued statements supporting the Donald Trump campaign, which has been viewed as potentially harmful to Colombia–United States relations.[168][169] On October 26, the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia, Philip Goldberg, requested that Colombian politicians abstain from getting involved in the elections.[170] The Department of Justice is investigating whether the Trump Victory Committee accepted a $100,000 donation from Malaysian businessman and international fugitive Jho Low, who is accused of being the mastermind behind the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal involving a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.[171][172] Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of 2016's election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty-first century attacks, and in fact conducted what were characterized as preemptive counter-strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in large-scale coordination of hacking,[173] and some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities. Nonetheless, after his dismissal, in a December 2020 interview, Chris Krebs, the Trump administration's director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described monitoring Election Day from CISA's joint command center along with representatives from the military's United States Cyber Command, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Secret Service (USSS), the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment, and representatives of state and local governments, as well as his agency's analysis preceding and after that day, saying, ""It was quiet. There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on, before, or after November third.""[174] Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote-counting in some areas, Krebs also affirmed that, ""All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America.""[174] Acts of foreign interference included Russian state-directed application of computational propaganda approaches, more conventional state-sponsored Internet propaganda, smaller-scale disinformation efforts, ""information laundering"" and ""trading up the chain"" propaganda tactics employing some government officials, Trump affiliates, and US media outlets.[175] During the campaign, Trump indicated in Twitter posts, interviews, and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated; Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him.[176][177][178] In July 2020, Trump declined to answer whether he would accept the results, just as he did in the 2016 presidential election, telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that ""I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say no.""[179][180][181][182] Trump repeatedly claimed that ""the only way"" he could lose would be if the election was ""rigged"" and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election.[183][184] Trump also attacked mail-in voting throughout the campaign, falsely claiming that the practice contains high rates of fraud;[185][186][187] at one point, Trump said, ""We'll see what happens ... Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation.""[188] Trump's statements have been described as a threat ""to upend the constitutional order"".[189] In September 2020, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, who was appointed by Trump, testified under oath that the FBI has ""not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise"".[190] A number of congressional Republicans insisted they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power, but declined to criticize Trump for his comments.[191] On September 24, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate's commitment to a peaceful transfer of power.[192] Trump also stated he expected the Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in case of an election dispute, reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[193] In April 2020, Biden suggested that Trump might try to delay the election, saying he ""is gonna try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can't be held"".[194][195] On July 30, Trump tweeted that ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history"" and asked if it should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person. Experts[who?] indicated that, for the election to be legally delayed, such a decision must be made by Congress.[196][197] And the Constitution sets the end of the presidential and vice-presidential terms at January 20, a hard deadline which cannot be altered by Congress except by constitutional amendment.[198][199] Postal voting in the United States has become increasingly common, with 25% of voters mailing their ballots in 2016 and 2018. By June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was predicted to cause a large increase in mail voting because of the possible danger of congregating at polling places.[201] An August 2020 state-by-state analysis concluded that 76% of Americans were eligible to vote by mail in 2020, a record number. The analysis predicted that 80 million ballots could be cast by mail in 2020 – more than double the number in 2016.[202] The Postal Service sent a letter to multiple states in July 2020, warning that the service would not be able to meet the state's deadlines for requesting and casting last-minute absentee ballots.[203] In addition to the anticipated high volume of mailed ballots, the prediction was due in part to numerous measures taken by Louis DeJoy, the newly installed United States Postmaster General, including banning overtime and extra trips to deliver mail,[204] which caused delays in delivering mail,[205] and dismantling and removing hundreds of high-speed mail sorting machines from postal centers.[206] On August 18, after the House of Representatives had been recalled from its August break to vote on a bill reversing the changes, DeJoy announced that he would roll back all the changes until after the November election. He said he would reinstate overtime hours, roll back service reductions, and halt the removal of mail-sorting machines and collection boxes.[207] The House of Representatives voted an emergency grant of $25 billion to the post office to facilitate the predicted flood of mail ballots.[208] Although Trump has repeatedly denounced mail voting, he has mailed in ballots due to being in a different state than the one where he votes at the time of the election.[209] In August 2020, Trump conceded that the post office would need additional funds to handle the additional mail-in voting, but said he would block any additional funding for the post office to prevent any increase in balloting by mail.[210] The Trump campaign filed lawsuits seeking to block the use of official ballot dropboxes in Pennsylvania in locations other than an election office, and also sought to ""block election officials from counting mail-in ballots if a voter forgets to put their mail-in ballot in a secrecy sleeve within the ballot return-envelope"".[211] The Trump campaign and the Republican Party both failed to produce any evidence of vote-by-mail fraud after being ordered by a federal judge to do so.[211] On Election Day, a judge ordered mail inspectors to search ""mail facilities in .... key battleground states"" for ballots.[212] The agency refused to comply with the order and nearly 7% of ballots in USPS facilities on Election Day were not processed in time.[213] The Federal Election Commission, which was created in 1974 to enforce campaign finance laws in federal elections, has not functioned since July 2020 due to vacancies in membership. In the absence of a quorum, the commission cannot vote on complaints or give guidance through advisory opinions.[214] As of May 19, 2020, there were 350 outstanding matters on the agency's enforcement docket and 227 items waiting for action.[215] As of September 1, 2020, Trump had not nominated anyone to fill the FEC vacancies.[216] On September 18, 2020, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately said the precedent he had set regarding the Merrick Garland nomination was inoperative and that a replacement would be voted on as soon as possible, setting the stage for a confirmation battle and an unexpected intrusion into the campaign.[217] The death of Justice Ginsburg resulted in large increases in momentum for both the Democrats and Republicans.[218][219] The president,[220] vice president,[221] and several Republican members of Congress said a full Supreme Court bench was needed to decide the upcoming election.[222][223] On September 26, the day after Justice Ginsburg's body lay in state at the Capitol, Trump held a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House to announce and introduce his candidate, Amy Coney Barrett.[224] After four days of confirmation hearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted the nomination out of committee on October 22,[225] and on October 26, Barrett was confirmed on a party-line vote of 52–48, with no Democrats voting for her confirmation.[226] This was the closest Supreme Court confirmation ever to a presidential election, and the first Supreme Court nomination since 1869 with no supporting votes from the minority party.[226] It was also one of the fastest timelines from nomination to confirmations in U.S. history.[227][228] On October 11, 2019, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced that three general election debates would be held in the fall of 2020.[234] The first, moderated by Chris Wallace, took place on September 29, and was co-hosted by Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.[235] The debate was originally to be hosted at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, but the university decided against holding the debate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[235][236] Biden was generally held to have won the first debate,[237][238][239] with a significant minority of commentators deeming it a draw.[240][241] One exchange that was particularly noted was when Trump did not directly denounce the white supremacist and neo-fascist group Proud Boys, instead responding that they should ""stand back and stand by"".[242][243][244] On the next day, Trump told reporters the group should ""stand down"" while also claiming that he was not aware of what the group was.[245][246] The debate was described as ""chaotic and nearly incoherent"" because of Trump's repeated interruptions, causing the CPD to consider adjustments to the format of the remaining debates.[247] The vice presidential debate was held on October 7, 2020, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.[248] The debate was widely held to be subdued, with no clear victor.[249][250] One incident that was particularly commented on was when a fly landed on vice-president Pence's head, and remained there unbeknownst to him for two minutes.[251][252] The second debate was initially set to be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but the university withdrew in June 2020, over concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.[253] The planned debate was rescheduled for October 15 at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in Miami; due to Trump contracting COVID-19, the CPD announced on October 8 that the debate would be held virtually, in which the candidates would appear from separate locations. Trump refused to participate in a virtual debate, and the commission subsequently announced that the debate had been cancelled.[254][255] The third scheduled debate took place on October 22 at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee, and was moderated by Kristen Welker.[256][257] The changes to the debate rules, which included the candidates' microphones being muted while the other was speaking,[258] resulted in it being generally considered more civil than the first debate.[259] Welker's performance as moderator was praised, with her being regarded as having done a good job preventing the candidates from interrupting each other.[260] Biden was generally held to have won the debate, though it was considered unlikely to alter the race to any considerable degree.[261][262][263] The Free & Equal Elections Foundation held two debates with various third party and independent candidates, one on October 8, 2020, in Denver, Colorado,[268] and another on October 24, 2020, in Cheyenne, Wyoming.[269] The following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from September 2019 to November 2020. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, had an average polling lead of 7.9 percentage points over incumbent President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden would win the national popular vote by 4.4 percentage points. Calculated averages are not comparable to those for the Biden vs. Trump polls. As polling with third parties has been very limited, the polls included in the average are often different. The following graph depicts the difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in each swing state in the poll aggregators from March 2020 to the election, with the election results for comparison. OpenSecrets estimated the total cost of the 2020 election nearly $14 billion, making it the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle.[270] The COVID-19 pandemic was a major issue of the campaign, with Trump's responses being heavily criticized. The president spread mixed messages on the value of wearing face masks as protection, including criticizing Biden and reporters for wearing them, but has also encouraged their use at times.[271] During the campaign, Trump held many events across the country, including in COVID-19 hotspots, where attendees did not wear masks and were not socially distancing; at the same time, he mocked those who wore face masks.[272][273][274] Biden advocated for the expansion of federal funding, including funding under the Defense Production Act for testing, personal protective equipment, and research.[275] Trump also invoked the Defense Production Act to control the distribution of masks and ventilators,[276] but his response plan relied significantly on a vaccine being released by the end of 2020.[275] At the second presidential debate, Trump claimed Biden had called him xenophobic for restricting entry from foreign nationals who had visited China, but Biden responded that he had not been referring to this decision.[277] Trump claimed credit for the consistent economic expansion of his presidency's first three years, with the stock market at its longest growth period in history and unemployment at a fifty-year low. Additionally, he has touted the 2020 third-quarter rebound, in which GDP grew at an annualized rate of 33.1%, as evidence of the success of his economic policies.[278] Biden responded to Trump's claims by repeating that the strong economy under Trump's presidency was inherited from the Obama administration, and that Trump has aggravated the economic impact of the pandemic, including the need for 42 million Americans to file for unemployment.[279] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered income taxes for many Americans and lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, were a major component of Trump's economic policy. Biden and the Democrats generally describe these cuts as unfairly benefiting the upper class. Biden plans to raise taxes on corporations and those making over $400,000 per year, while keeping the reduced taxes on lower-income brackets and raise capital gains taxes to a maximum bracket of 39.6%. In response, Trump said Biden's plans would destroy retirement accounts and the stock market.[280] Trump and Biden's views on environmental policy differ significantly. Trump stated that climate change is a hoax, although he also called it a serious subject.[281] Trump condemned the Paris Agreement on greenhouse gas reduction and began the withdrawal process. Biden planned to rejoin it and announced a $2 trillion plan to combat climate change. Biden had not fully accepted the Green New Deal. Biden did not plan to ban fracking but rather to outlaw new fracking on federal land. In a debate, Trump claimed Biden wanted to ban it altogether. Trump's other environmental policies included the removal of methane emission standards, and an expansion of mining.[282] Health care was a divisive issue in both the Democratic primary campaign and the general campaign. While Biden, as well as other candidates, promised protection of the Affordable Care Act, progressives within the Democratic Party advocated to replace the private insurance industry with Medicare for All. Biden's plan involves adding a public option to the American healthcare system,[283] and the restoration of the individual mandate to buy health care, which was removed from the Affordable Care Act by the 2017 tax cut bill,[284] as well as restoring funding for Planned Parenthood. Trump announced plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, calling it ""too expensive"", but he did not say what would replace it.[285] At the time of the election, the Trump administration and Republican officials from 18 states had a lawsuit before the Supreme Court, asking the court to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[286] As a result of the murder of George Floyd and other incidents of police brutality against African Americans, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a series of protests and a wider period of racial unrest erupted in mid-2020. This was followed by the Black Lives Matter movement, which protested police brutality against black people, and became a central point of the 2020 presidential campaign.[287] Protests were mostly peaceful; fewer than 4% involved property damage or violence (with most of the latter directed at BLM protesters themselves).[288] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism, and looting caused about $1–2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[289][290] In response, Trump and the Republicans suggested sending in the military to counter the protests, which was criticized, especially by Democrats, as heavy-handed and potentially illegal.[291] Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters confronting diners in a restaurant as ""thugs"",[292] and called a street painting of the slogan a ""symbol of hate"".[293] Particularly controversial was a photo-op Trump took in front of St. John's Church in Washington, D.C., before which military police had forcefully cleared peaceful protestors from the area.[284] Biden condemned Trump for his actions against protestors; he described George Floyd's words ""I can't breathe"" as a ""wake-up call for our nation"". He also promised he would create a police oversight commission in his first 100 days as president, and establish a uniform use of force standard, as well as other police reform measures.[294] More than 158 million votes were cast in the election.[309] More than 100 million of them were cast before Election Day by early voting or mail ballot, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.[310] The election saw the highest voter turnout as a percentage of eligible voters since 1900,[311] with each of the two main tickets receiving more than 74 million votes, surpassing Barack Obama's record of 69.5 million votes from 2008.[312] The Biden–Harris ticket received more than 81 million votes, the most votes ever in a U.S. presidential election.[10][11] It was also the ninth consecutive presidential election where the victorious major party nominee did not receive a popular vote majority by a double-digit margin over the losing major party nominee(s), continuing the longest sequence of such presidential elections in U.S. history, which began in 1988 and in 2016 eclipsed the previous longest sequence, that from 1876 through 1900.[313][note 1][314] In 2020, 58 percent of U.S. voters lived in landslide counties,[315] a decline from 61 percent in 2016.[316] Trump became the eleventh incumbent in the country's history, and the first since 1992, to lose a bid for a second term. Biden's 51.3% of the popular vote was the highest for a challenger to an incumbent president since 1932.[317][318][319][m] Biden is the sixth vice president to become president without succeeding to the office on the death or resignation of a previous president.[320] Additionally, Trump's loss marked the third time an elected president lost the popular vote twice, the first being John Quincy Adams in the 1820s and Benjamin Harrison in the 1880s and 1890s.[321] This was the first time since 1980, and the first for Republicans since 1892 that a party was voted out after a single four-year term. This was the second election in American history in which the incumbent president lost re-election despite winning a greater share of the popular vote than he did in the previous election, after 1828. It is also the third election in which the two candidates that received electoral votes carried the same number of states. This also happened in 1880 and 1848. Biden won 25 states, the District of Columbia, and one congressional district in Nebraska, totaling 306 electoral votes. Trump won 25 states and one congressional district in Maine, totaling 232 electoral votes. This result was exactly the reverse of Trump's victory, 306 to 232, in 2016 (excluding faithless electors).[322] Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in Georgia since 1992 and in Arizona since 1996,[20] and the first candidate to win nationally without Florida since 1992 and Ohio since 1960, casting doubt on Ohio's continued status as a bellwether state.[323] Biden carried five states won by Trump in 2016: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. He also became the first Democrat since 2008 to carry Nebraska's 2nd congressional district, winning one electoral vote from the state. Trump did not win any states won by Clinton in 2016. Biden's three gains in the Rust Belt—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—were widely characterized as a rebuilding of the blue wall, a term widely used in the press for the states consistently won by Democrats from 1992 to 2012, broken by Trump in 2016 when he flipped those three Rust Belt states.[324][325][326][327] Nevertheless, amidst Trump's national and electoral defeat, his scoring decisive victories in Ohio, Iowa, and Florida for the second time, after their having backed Obama twice, has led many commentators to conclude they have shifted from perennial swing states to reliable red states.[328][329] In light of the attempts to contest the election results, an important question is how many votes would have had to change in particular states in order to produce a different Electoral College outcome. If Biden's three narrowest state victories—Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona, all of which he won by less than a percentage point—had gone to Trump, there would have been a tie of 269 electors for each candidate,[330][331] causing a contingent election to be decided by the House of Representatives, where Trump had the advantage. (Even though Democrats controlled the House, contingent elections are determined by state delegations in which each state receives just one vote, and since a slight majority of states in 2020 contained more Republican than Democratic representatives, Republicans would have had more votes in such an election.) This scenario would have required a popular-vote shift of 0.63% or less in each of these three states, a total of about 43,000 votes, 0.03% of votes cast nationally. A similar situation occurred in 2016, when a shift of 0.77% or less in each of the three most closely contested states (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania), or about 77,000 votes, would have resulted in the popular-vote winner Hillary Clinton also winning in the Electoral College.[332] Almost all counties previously considered reliable indicators of eventual success in presidential elections voted for Trump instead of Biden, meaning that they did not continue their streaks as bellwether counties. This was attributed to increasing political polarization throughout the country and to the urban–rural divide.[333] While Trump still dominated rural America as a whole, there were rural areas that he lost. Biden won 50.5% of the rural counties that each had mostly non-white voters, particularly in the South and the West.[334] Rural counties in the South won by Biden had greater economic distress than those won by Trump; in the Northeast, the opposite was true.[334] In the West, Biden did especially well in rural counties that had high shares of workers employed in leisure and hospitality.[334] Such counties likewise had large constituencies of immigration from other states.[334] Every state won by Biden was won by more votes than those by which Hillary Clinton won the state. The combined vote margin of these states was equal to Biden's gain over Hillary Clinton.[335] Biden became the oldest president ever elected, besting Ronald Reagan's record in 1984, and the oldest non-incumbent ever, besting Trump in 2016. Major news organizations project a state for a candidate when there is high mathematical confidence that the outstanding vote would be unlikely to prevent the projected winner from ultimately winning the state. Election projections are made by decision teams of political scientists and data scientists.[19] On the morning of November 7 at approximately 11:30 a.m. EST, roughly three and a half days after polls had closed, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, the Associated Press, CNN, and Fox News all called the election for Biden, based on projections of votes in Pennsylvania showing him leading outside of the recount threshold (0.5% in that state).[336][337][338][339][340][341] That evening, Biden and Harris gave victory speeches in Wilmington, Delaware.[342] On the invitation of the U.S. State Department, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which has been monitoring U.S. elections since 2002 (as it does for major elections in all other OSCE member countries), sent 102 observers from 39 countries.[343][344][345] The task force consisted of long-term observers from the ODIHR office (led by former Polish diplomat Urszula Gacek) deployed to 28 states from September on and covering 15 states on election day, and a group of European lawmakers acting as short-term observers (led by German parliamentarian Michael Georg Link), reporting from Maryland, Virginia, California, Nevada, Michigan, Missouri, Wisconsin, and D.C.[343][345] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was scaled down to a ""limited election observation mission"" from the originally planned 100 long-term observers and 400 short-term observers.[343] An interim report published by the OSCE shortly before the election noted that many ODIHR interlocutors ""expressed grave concerns about the risk of legitimacy of the elections being questioned due to the incumbent President's repeated allegations of a fraudulent election process, and postal vote in particular.""[343][346] On the day after the election, the task force published preliminary findings,[344] with part of the summary stating: The 3 November general elections were competitive and well managed despite legal uncertainties and logistical challenges. In a highly polarized political environment, harsh campaign rhetoric fuelled tensions. Measures intended to secure the elections during the pandemic triggered protracted litigation driven by partisan interests. The uncertainty caused by late legal challenges and evidence-deficient claims about election fraud created confusion and concern among election officials and voters. Voter registration and identification rules in some states are unduly restrictive for certain groups of citizens. The media, although sharply polarized, provided comprehensive coverage of the campaign and made efforts to provide accurate information on the organization of elections.[347] Link said that ""on the election day itself, we couldn't see any violations"" at the polling places visited by the observers.[344] The task force also found ""nothing untoward"" while observing the handling of mail-in ballots at post offices, with Gacek being quoted as saying: ""We feel that allegations of systemic wrongdoing in these elections have no solid ground. The system has held up well.""[345] The OSCE's election monitoring branch published a more comprehensive report in early 2021.[345][348] Candidates are listed individually below if they received more than 0.1% of the popular vote. Popular vote totals are from the Federal Election Commission report.[1] Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates by congressional districts. The winner of each congressional district gets one electoral vote for the district. The winner of the statewide vote gets two additional electoral votes.[354][355] States where the margin of victory was under 1% (37 electoral votes; all won by Biden): States where the margin of victory was between 1% and 5% (86 electoral votes; 42 won by Biden, 44 by Trump): States/districts where the margin of victory was between 5% and 10% (80 electoral votes; 17 won by Biden, 63 by Trump): Blue denotes states or congressional districts won by Democrat Joe Biden; red denotes those won by Republican Donald Trump. Counties with highest percentage of Democratic vote:[356] Counties with highest percentage of Republican vote: Voter demographic data for 2020 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on exit polls completed by 15,590 voters in person as well as by phone.[358] The Brookings Institution released a report entitled ""Exit polls show both familiar and new voting blocs sealed Biden's win"" on November 12, 2020. In it, author William H. Frey attributes Obama's 2008 win to young people, people of color, and the college-educated. Frey contends Trump won in 2016 thanks to older White without college degrees.[361] Frey says the same coalitions largely held in 2008 and 2016, although in key battleground states Biden increased his vote among some of the 2016 Trump groups, particularly among White and older Americans.[361] Trump won the white vote in 2016 by 20% but in 2020 by only 16%. The Democratic Party won black voters by 75%, the lowest margin since 1980. Democrats won the Latino vote by 32%, which is the smallest margin since 2004, and they won the Asian American vote by 27%, the lowest figure since 2008.[361] Biden reduced the Republican margin of white men without college educations from 48% to 42%, and the Democrats made a slight improvement of 2% among white, college-educated women. People age 18 to 29 registered a rise in Democratic support between 2016 and 2020, with the Democratic margin of victory among that demographic increasing from 19% to 24%.[361] Post-election analysis using verified voter data found the Associated Press's Votecast was more accurate than the exit polls.[362][363] Biden won 65% of the Latino vote according to Edison Research, and 63% according to the Associated Press. Voto Latino reported that the Latino vote was crucial to the Biden victory in Arizona. 40% of Latino voters who voted in 2020 did not vote in 2016, and 73% of those Latino voters voted for Biden (438,000 voters).[364] Florida and Texas, which have large Latino populations, were carried by Trump. In Florida, Trump won a majority of Cuban American voters in Miami-Dade County, Florida.[365] The Latino vote was still crucial to enable Biden to carry states such as Nevada.[366] Latino voters were targeted by a major Spanish-language disinformation campaign in the final weeks of the election, with various falsehoods and conspiracy theories being pushed out by WhatsApp and viral social media posts.[367][368][369] Demographic patterns emerged having to do with country of origin and candidate preference. Pre- and post-election surveys showed Biden winning Latinos of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican,[370] and Spanish heritage,[371] while Trump carried Latinos of Cuban heritage. Data from Florida showed Biden holding a narrow edge among South Americans.[372] Biden won 87% of the Black vote, while Trump won 12%.[373] Biden's advantage among Black voters was crucial in the large cities of Pennsylvania and Michigan; the increase in the Democratic vote in Milwaukee County of about 28,000 votes was more than the 20,000-vote lead Biden had in the state of Wisconsin. Almost half Biden's gains in Georgia came from the four largest counties – Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Cobb – all in the Atlanta metro area with large Black populations.[374] Trump improved his overall share of the Black vote from 2016 by 4% and doubled the Black vote that Mitt Romney received in 2012.[375][376][373] Polls showed that 68% of Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) voters supported Biden/Harris, while 28% supported Trump/Pence. Karthick Ramakrishnan, a political science professor at the University of California Riverside and founder of AAPI Data, said Asian Americans supported Biden over Trump by about a 2:1 margin. Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Indian Americans, and Chinese Americans favored Biden by higher margins overall compared to Vietnamese Americans and Filipino Americans.[377] Many voters were turned off by Trump's language some of which was widely considered racist such as (""China virus"" and ""kung flu"") but, according to Vox reporter Terry Nguyen, many Vietnamese voters (and especially elderly, South Vietnamese migrants who populated coastal centers in the 1970s) appreciated his strong anti-China stance.[378] Data from FiveThirtyEight indicated 65% of Indian American voters backed Joe Biden, and 28% supported Donald Trump.[377] Some Indian Americans self-identified with Kamala Harris, but others approved of Donald Trump's support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[379] In a speech given to 50,000 Indian-Americans during his 2019 visit to the US, Modi praised Trump with remarks that were interpreted as an indirect endorsement of his candidacy.[380] Indian right-wing organizations like the Hindu Sena had performed special havans and pujas for Trump's electoral victory.[381] Pre-election voter surveys by Indian Country Today found 68% of American Indian and Alaska Native voters supporting Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[382] In particular, the Navajo Reservation, which spans a large quadrant of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico, delivered up to 97% of their votes per precinct to Biden,[383] while overall support for Biden was between 60 and 90% on the Reservation.[384] Biden also posted large turnout among Havasupai, Hopi, and Tohono O'odham peoples,[385] delivering a large win in New Mexico and flipping Arizona. In Montana, while the state went for Trump overall, Biden won counties overlapping reservations of the Blackfeet, Fort Belknap, Crow and Northern Cheyenne.[386] The same pattern held in South Dakota, with most of the counties overlapping the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux, Oglala Sioux, Rosebud Sioux and Crow Creek tribes going for Biden. For example, in Oglala Lakota County, which overlaps with the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Biden won 88% of the vote.[386] Trump's strongest performance among Native tribes was with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, where he won a strong majority in Robeson County and flipped Scotland County from Democratic to Republican.[387] Trump had campaigned in Lumberton, in Robeson County, and had promised the Lumbees federal recognition.[387] Although polls generally predicted the Biden victory, the national polls overestimated him by three to four points, and some state polling was even further from the actual result and greater than 2016's error (one or two points).[388] The numbers represented the highest level of error since the 1980 presidential election.[389] This polling overestimation also applied in several Senate races, where the Democrats underperformed by about five points relative to the polls,[390] as well as the House elections, where Republicans gained seats instead of losing as polls predicted. Most pollsters underestimated support for Trump in several key battleground states, including Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin. The discrepancy between poll predictions and the actual result persisted from the 2016 election despite pollsters' attempts to fix problems with polling in 2016, in which they underestimated the Republican vote in several states. The imprecise polls led to changes in campaigning and fundraising decisions for both Democrats and Republicans.[388] According to The New York Times, polling misses have been attributed to, among other issues, reduced average response to polling; the relative difficulty to poll certain types of voters; and pandemic-related problems, such as a theory which suggests Democrats were less willing to vote in person on Election Day than Republicans for fear of contracting COVID-19.[388] According to CNN, research presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research indicated one of the primary problems was an inability by pollsters to include a certain segment of Trump supporters, either due to inaccessibility or lack of participation.[389] New Statesman data journalist Ben Walker pointed to Hispanics as a historically difficult group to poll accurately, leading to pollsters underestimating the level of Trump support within the demographic group.[391] Election analyst Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote that the polling error was completely normal by historical standards and disputes the narrative that polls were wrong.[392] Election night, November 3, ended without a clear winner, as many state results were too close to call and millions of votes remained uncounted, including in the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada.[393] Results were delayed in these states due to local rules on counting mail-in ballots.[394] In a victory declared after midnight, Trump won the swing state of Florida by over three percentage points, an increase from his 1.2 percentage point margin in 2016, having seen significant gains in support among the Latino community in Miami-Dade County.[395] Shortly after 12:30 a.m. EST, Biden made a short speech in which he urged his supporters to be patient while the votes are counted, and said he believed he was ""on track to win this election"".[396][397] Shortly before 2:30 a.m. EST, Trump made a speech to a roomful of supporters, falsely asserting that he had won the election and calling for a stop to all vote counting, saying that continued counting was ""a fraud on the American people"" and ""we will be going to the U.S. Supreme Court.""[398][399] The Biden campaign denounced these attempts, claiming the Trump campaign was engaging in a ""naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens"".[400] In Pennsylvania, where the counting of mail-in ballots began on election night, Trump declared victory on November 4 with a lead of 675,000 votes, despite more than a million ballots remaining uncounted. Trump also declared victory in North Carolina and Georgia, despite many ballots being uncounted.[401] At 11:20 p.m. EST on election night, Fox News projected Biden would win Arizona, with the Associated Press making the same call at 2:50 a.m. EST on November 4;[402][403] several other media outlets concluded the state was too close to call.[404][405] By the evening of November 4, the Associated Press reported that Biden had secured 264 electoral votes by winning Michigan and Wisconsin, with Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada remaining uncalled.[406] Biden had a 1% lead in Nevada[407] and maintained a 2.3% lead in Arizona by November 5,[408] needing only to win Nevada and Arizona or to win Pennsylvania to obtain the necessary 270 electoral votes.[406] Some Trump supporters expressed concerns of possible fraud after seeing the president leading in some states on Election Night, only to see Biden take the lead in subsequent days. Election experts[409] attributed this to several factors, including a ""red mirage"" of early results being counted in relatively thinly populated rural areas that favored Trump, which are quicker to count, followed later by results from more heavily populated urban areas that favored Biden, which take longer to count. In some states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, Republican-controlled legislatures prohibited mail-in ballots from being counted before Election Day, and once those ballots were counted they generally favored Biden, at least in part because Trump had for months raised concerns about mail-in ballots, encouraging his supporters instead to vote in person. By contrast, in states such as Florida, which allowed counting of mail-in ballots for weeks prior to Election Day, an early blue shift giving the appearance of a Biden lead was later overcome by in-person voting that favored Trump, resulting in the state being called for the president on Election Night.[410][411][412] On November 5, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to stop vote-counting in Pennsylvania. The Trump campaign had alleged that its observers were not given access to observe the vote, but its lawyers admitted during the hearing that its observers were already present in the vote-counting room.[413] Also that day, a state judge dismissed another lawsuit by the Trump campaign which alleged that in Georgia, late-arriving ballots were counted. The judge ruled no evidence had been produced that the ballots were late.[414] Meanwhile, a state judge in Michigan dismissed the Trump campaign's lawsuit requesting a pause in vote-counting to allow access to observers, as the judge noted that vote-counting had already finished in Michigan.[415] That judge also noted the official complaint did not state ""why"", ""when, where, or by whom"" an election observer was allegedly blocked from observing ballot-counting in Michigan.[416] On November 6, Biden assumed leads in Pennsylvania and Georgia as the states continued to count ballots, and absentee votes in those states heavily favored Biden.[417] Due to the slim margin between Biden and Trump in the state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced on November 6 that a recount would be held in Georgia. At that point, Georgia had not seen ""any widespread irregularities"" in this election, according to the voting system manager of the state, Gabriel Sterling.[418] Also, on November 6, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito issued an order requiring officials in Pennsylvania to segregate late-arriving ballots, amid a dispute as to whether the state's Supreme Court validly ordered a 3-day extension of the deadline for mail-in ballots to arrive.[419] Several Republican attorneys general filed amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court in subsequent days agreeing with the Pennsylvania Republican Party's view that only the state legislature could change the voting deadline.[420] Protests against Trump's challenges to the election results occurred in Minneapolis, Portland, New York, and other cities. Police in Minneapolis arrested more than 600 demonstrators for blocking traffic on an interstate highway. In Portland, the National Guard was called out after some protesters smashed windows and threw objects at police.[428] At the same time, groups of Trump supporters gathered outside of election centers in Phoenix, Detroit, and Philadelphia, shouting objections to counts that showed Biden leading or gaining ground.[428] In Arizona, where Biden's lead was shrinking as more results were reported, the pro-Trump protesters mostly demanded that all remaining votes be counted, while in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump's lead shrank and disappeared altogether as more results were reported, they called for the count to be stopped.[429] Trump and a variety of his surrogates and supporters made a series of observably false claims that the election was fraudulent. Claims that substantial fraud was committed have been repeatedly debunked.[432][433] On November 9 and 10, The New York Times called the offices of top election officials in every state; all 45 of those who responded said there was no evidence of fraud. Some described the election as remarkably successful considering the coronavirus pandemic, the record turnout, and the unprecedented number of mailed ballots.[33] On November 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a statement calling the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history"" and noting ""[t]here is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.""[35] Five days later, Trump fired the director of CISA, whom he had appointed in 2018.[434] As ballots were still being counted two days after Election Day, Trump falsely asserted that there was ""tremendous corruption and fraud going on"", adding: ""If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us.""[435] Trump has repeatedly claimed as suspicious that mail-in ballots showed significantly more support for Biden.[436] This blue shift phenomenon is believed to occur because more Democrats than Republicans tend to vote by mail, and mail ballots are counted after Election Day in many states. Leading up to the 2020 election, the effect was predicted to be even greater than usual, as Trump's attacks on mail-in voting may have deterred Republicans from casting mail ballots.[437] In early January 2021, Trump falsely proclaimed that he had by rights won all 50 states in the presidential election and a 535 to 3 electoral college victory. On January 2, during his phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia Secretary of State, Trump said, ""As you know, every single state. We won every state; we won every statehouse in the country... But we won every single statehouse.""[438] Two days later, on January 4, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Dalton, Georgia, supporting Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. During his speech at the rally, Trump again asserted that he won ""every single state"", and ""We win every state, and they're going to have this guy [Biden] be President?""[439] Many claims of purported voter fraud were discovered to be false or misleading. In Fulton County, Georgia, the number of votes affected was 342, with no breakdown of which candidates they were for.[440] A viral video of a Pennsylvania poll worker filling out a ballot was found to be a case of a damaged ballot being replicated to ensure proper counting, while a video claiming to show a man taking ballots illegally to a Detroit counting center was found to show a photographer transporting his equipment.[441][442] Another video of a poll watcher being turned away in Philadelphia was found to be real, but the poll watcher had subsequently been allowed inside after a misunderstanding had been resolved.[443] A viral tweet claimed 14,000 votes in Wayne County, Michigan, were cast by dead people, but the list of names included was found to be incorrect.[444] The Trump campaign and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson also claimed a man named James Blalock had voted in Georgia despite having died in 2006, but in fact his 94-year-old widow had registered and voted as Mrs. James Blalock.[445] In Erie, Pennsylvania, a postal worker who claimed the postmaster had instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after Election Day later admitted he had fabricated the claim. Prior to this recantation, Republican senator Lindsey Graham cited the claim in a letter to the Justice Department calling for an investigation, and a GoFundMe page created for the postal worker ""patriot"" raised $136,000.[446] Days after Biden had been declared the winner, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asserted without evidence that the Democratic Party was welcoming fraud and illegal voting.[447] Republican former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich stated on Fox News, ""I think that it is a corrupt, stolen election.""[448] Appearing at a press conference outside a Philadelphia landscaping business as Biden was being declared the winner, Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani asserted without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots were questionable.[449] Responding to Giuliani, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said: ""Many of the claims against the commonwealth have already been dismissed, and repeating these false attacks is reckless. No active lawsuit even alleges, and no evidence presented so far has shown, widespread problems.""[33] One week after the election, Republican Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt said he had not seen any evidence of widespread fraud, stating, ""I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all and see them spread."" He added that his office had examined a list of dead people who purportedly voted in Philadelphia but ""not a single one of them voted in Philadelphia after they died."" Trump derided Schmidt, tweeting, ""He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption & dishonesty. We win!""[450] Attorneys who brought accusations of voting fraud or irregularities before judges could not produce valid evidence to support the allegations. In one instance, a Trump attorney sought to have ballot counting halted in Detroit on the basis of a Republican poll watcher's claim that an unidentified person had said ballots were being backdated; Michigan Court of Appeals judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed the argument as ""inadmissible hearsay within hearsay"".[451][452] Some senior attorneys at law firms working for Trump, notably Jones Day, expressed concerns that they were undermining the integrity of American elections by advancing arguments without evidence.[453] Trump and his lawyers Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly made the false claim that the Toronto, Ontario-based firm Dominion Voting Systems, which had supplied voting machines for 27 states, was a ""communist"" organization controlled by billionaire George Soros, former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez (who died in 2013), or the Chinese Communist Party, and that the machines had ""stolen"" hundreds of thousands of votes from Trump. Defamatory rumors about the company circulated on social media, amplified by more than a dozen tweets or retweets by Trump. The disinformation campaign prompted threats and harassment against Dominion employees.[456] A December 2020 poll showed 77% of Republicans believed widespread fraud occurred during the election, along with 35% of independent voters.[457] Overall, 60% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 34% did not, and 6% were unsure. Another poll taken in late December showed a similar result, with 62% of Americans polled believing Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, while 37% did not.[458] This split in popular opinion remained largely stable, with a January 10, 2021, poll commissioned by ABC News showing 68% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate and 32% did not.[459] These numbers remained largely stagnant, with a June 2021 poll from Monmouth showing 61% believed Biden won fair and square, 32% believed he won due to fraud, and 7% were unsure.[460] More than a year later, public opinion on the matter still remained stagnant, with a poll commissioned by ABC News finding that 65% of Americans believed Biden's win was legitimate, 33% believed it was not legitimate, and 2% were unsure. The same poll also found that 72% of Americans thought the people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were attacking democracy, while 25% thought they were protecting democracy, and 3% were unsure.[461] A March 2022 poll commissioned by the conservative Rasmussen Reports found that 52% of voters think that it is likely that cheating ""affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election."" while 40% of voters believe that it is unlikely. 33% say that cheating was very likely, 19% say it was somewhat likely, 13% say it was somewhat unlikely, and 27% say it was very unlikely.[462] Motivated by the myth of widespread fraud, Republican state lawmakers initiated a push to make voting laws more restrictive.[463] After the election, the Trump campaign filed lawsuits in multiple states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.[464] Lawyers and other observers noted the suits were unlikely to affect the outcome. Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt said, ""There's literally nothing that I've seen yet with the meaningful potential to affect the final result.""[465] Some law firms moved to drop their representation in lawsuits challenging results of the election.[466] Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn Biden's win in Georgia through litigation; suits by the Trump campaign and allies were rejected by both the Georgia Supreme Court[467] and by federal courts.[468][469] Trump also sought to overturn Biden's win by pressuring Kemp to call a special session of the Georgia General Assembly so state legislators could override the Georgia election results and appoint a pro-Trump slate of electors, an entreaty rebuffed by Kemp.[470] On December 20, Giuliani filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court, asking them to overturn the results of the Pennsylvania election and direct the state legislature to appoint electors. The Supreme Court was regarded as very unlikely to grant this petition, and in any case Biden would still have a majority of Electoral College votes without Pennsylvania.[471] The Court set the deadline for reply briefs from the respondents for January 22, 2021, two days after President Elect Biden's inauguration.[472] On December 9, Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court, asking the court to overturn the results in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia. Attorneys general of seventeen other states also signed onto the lawsuit.[473][474][475] 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives, more than two-thirds of the Republican caucus, signed an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.[476] The suit was rejected by the Supreme Court on December 11.[477][478] Early in the morning on November 4, with vote counts still going on in many states, Trump claimed he had won: ""This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election, frankly we did win this election.""[480] For weeks after the networks had called the election for Biden, Trump refused to acknowledge that Biden had won. Unlike every losing major party presidential candidate before him, Trump refused to formally concede, breaking with the tradition of formal concession started in 1896, when William Jennings Bryan sent a congratulatory telegram to President-elect William McKinley.[481] Biden described Trump's refusal as ""an embarrassment"".[482] In the wake of the election, Trump's White House ordered government agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team in any way,[483] and the General Services Administration (GSA) refused to formally acknowledge Biden's victory,[484] Trump finally acknowledged Biden's victory in a tweet on November 15, although he refused to concede and blamed his loss on fraud, stating: ""He won because the Election was Rigged."" Trump then tweeted: ""I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.""[485][486] In a June 2021 interview with Sean Hannity, Trump stated that ""we didn't win"" and said that he wished President Biden success in international diplomacy, which Forbes declared as Trump ""[coming] as close as he's ever been to conceding his 2020 election loss.""[487] Although all major media outlets called the election for Biden on November 7, the head of the General Services Administration (GSA), Trump appointee Emily W. Murphy, refused for over two weeks to certify Biden as the president-elect. Without formal GSA ascertainment of the winner, the official transition process was delayed.[488] On November 23, Murphy acknowledged Biden as the winner and said the Trump administration would begin the transition. Trump said he had instructed his administration to ""do what needs to be done"" but did not concede, and indicated he would continue his fight to overturn the election results.[489] Both before and after the election, Trump and other Republican leaders publicly considered asking certain Republican-controlled state legislatures to select presidential electors favoring Trump, even if Biden won the popular vote in those states.[490] In Pennsylvania, a state which Biden won, the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a federal judge to consider allowing the Republican-controlled state legislature to select electors.[491] Legal experts, including New York University law professor Richard Pildes, have raised numerous legal and political objections to this policy, noting that in various battleground states, Democratic Party members holding statewide office would thwart such efforts,[492] and ultimately Congress would probably reject the votes of legislatively appointed electors over those elected by the voters.[493] Law professor Lawrence Lessig noted that while the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to determine how electors are selected, including the power to directly appoint them, Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 gives Congress the power to determine when electors must be appointed, which they have designated to be Election Day, meaning that legislatures cannot change how electors are appointed for an election after this date.[494] In modern times, most states have used a popular vote within their state as the determining factor in who gets all the state's electors,[492] and changing election rules after an election could also violate the Constitution's Due Process Clause.[495] In November, Trump focused his efforts on trying to delay vote certifications at the county and state level.[496] On December 2, Trump posted a 46-minute video to his social media in which he repeated his baseless claims that the election was ""rigged"" and fraudulent, and he called for either state legislatures or courts to overturn the election and allow him to stay in office.[497] He continued to pressure elected Republicans in Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania in an unprecedented attempt to overturn his loss. Some commentators have characterized Trump's actions as an attempted coup d'état or self-coup.[47] On December 15, the day after the electoral college vote, Republican Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who was previously said he would not recognize the election results, publicly accepted Biden's win, saying, ""Today, I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.""[498] A December 18 meeting in the White House discussed Michael Flynn's suggestion to overturn the election by invoking martial law and rerunning the election in several swing states under military supervision.[499][500][501] Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville later issued a joint statement saying: ""There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.""[502] In a December 20 tweet, Trump dismissed accusations that he wanted to declare martial law as ""fake news"".[503] In a December 21 news conference, outgoing attorney general William Barr disavowed several actions reportedly being considered by Trump, including seizing voting machines, appointing a special counsel to investigate voter fraud, and appointing one to investigate Hunter Biden.[504] As the Trump campaign's lawsuits were repeatedly rejected in court, Trump personally communicated with Republican local and state officials in at least three states, including state legislators, attorneys general, and governors who had supported him during and after the elections. He pressured them to overturn the election results in their states by recounting votes, throwing out certain votes, or getting the state legislature to replace the elected Democratic slate of Electoral College members with a Republican slate of electors chosen by the legislature.[505] In late November, he personally phoned Republican members of two county electoral boards in Michigan, urging them to reverse their vote certifications.[506] He invited members of the Michigan state legislature to the White House, where they declined his suggestion that they choose a new slate of electors.[507] He repeatedly spoke to the Republican governor of Georgia and the secretary of state, demanding that they reverse their state's election results, and retaliating when they did not, strongly criticizing them in speeches and tweets, and demanding that the governor resign.[508] During the first week of December, Trump twice phoned the speaker of the Pennsylvania state House of Representatives, urging him to appoint a replacement slate of electors; the speaker said he did not have that power but later joined in a letter encouraging the state's representatives in Congress to dispute the results.[505] On January 4 The Washington Post reported that in a phone call on January 2, Trump pressured Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to overturn the state's result, telling him ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" and threatening him with legal action if he did not cooperate.[42][509] On January 4, 2021, Democratic congressional leaders, believing Trump ""engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes"", requested the FBI to investigate the incident.[510] In addition, while some House Republicans tried to defend Trump's Georgia call, Democrats began drafting a censure resolution.[511] Two months later The Washington Post acknowledged that they had misquoted Trump, and added a correction to the article.[512] Also on January 2, 2021, Trump took part in a mass phone call with nearly 300 state legislators from Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in which he urged them to ""decertify"" the election results in their states.[513] On November 11, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ordered a statewide hand recount of the vote in addition to the normal audit process. At the time, Biden held a lead of 13,558 votes.[514] The audit was concluded on November 19 and affirmed Biden's lead by 12,284 votes. Therefore, the results of the hand recount netted Trump 1,274 votes. The change in the count was due to a number of human errors, including memory cards that did not upload properly to the state servers, and was not attributable to any fraud in the original tally.[515][516] After certifying the results Republican governor Brian Kemp called for another hand audit, demanding to compare signatures on absentee ballot requests to actual ballots, despite the fact that this request was impossible,[468] as signatures on mail-in ballot applications and envelopes are checked when they are originally received by election offices, and that ballots are thereafter separated from envelopes to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.[517][518] The Trump campaign requested a machine recount, which was estimated to cost taxpayers $200,000 in one Georgia county alone.[519] On December 7, Biden was confirmed as the winner of the recount requested by Trump's campaign.[468] On November 18, the Trump campaign wired $3 million to pay for partial recounts in Milwaukee County and Dane County, Wisconsin, where Milwaukee and Madison, the two largest cities in the state and Democratic strongholds, are located.[520][521] During the recount, Milwaukee County election commissioner Tim Posnanski said several Republican observers were breaking rules by posing as independents.[522] The recount started November 20 and concluded on November 29, increasing Biden's lead by 87 votes.[523] The presidential electors met in the state capitol of each state and in the District of Columbia on December 14, 2020, and formalized Biden's victory, casting 306 votes for Biden/Harris and 232 votes for Trump/Pence.[524][525] Unlike the 2016 election, there were no faithless electors.[526] In six swing states won by Biden, groups of self-appointed Republican ""alternate electors"" met on the same day to vote for Trump. These alternate slates were not signed by the governors of the states they claim to represent, did not have the backing of any state legislature, and have no legal status.[525][527] Even after the casting of the electoral votes and rejection of his lawsuits seeking to overturn the election by at least 86 judges,[525] Trump refused to concede defeat.[524][525][528] In a speech following the Electoral College vote, Biden praised the resiliency of U.S. democratic institutions and the high election turnout (calling it ""one of the most amazing demonstrations of civic duty we've ever seen in our country"") and called for national unity. Biden also condemned Trump, and those who backed his efforts to subvert the election outcome, for adopting a stance ""so extreme that we've never seen it before – a position that refused to respect the will of the people, refused to respect the rule of law and refused to honor our Constitution"" and for exposing state election workers and officials to ""political pressure, verbal abuse and even threats of physical violence"" that was ""simply unconscionable"".[529][528] The 117th United States Congress first convened on January 3, 2021, and was scheduled to count and certify the Electoral College votes on January 6, 2021. There were 222 Democrats and 212 Republicans in the House; there were 51 Republicans, 46 Democrats, and two independents in the Senate. Several Republican members of the House and Senate said they would raise objections to the reported count in several states,[530][531] meeting the requirement that if a member from each body objects, the two houses must meet separately to discuss whether to accept the certified state vote.[532][533] A statement from the vice president's office said Pence welcomes the plan by Republicans to ""raise objections and bring forward evidence"" challenging the election results.[534] On December 28, 2020, Representative Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in Texas challenging the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, claiming Vice President Pence has the power and ability to unilaterally decide which slates of electoral votes get counted.[535][536] The case was dismissed on January 1, 2021, for lack of both standing and jurisdiction.[537][538] The plaintiffs filed an appeal, and the appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the appeals court the next day.[539] As vice president, Pence was due to preside over the January 6, 2021, congressional session to count the electoral votes, which is normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election, demanding both in public and in private that Pence use his position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump and Pence the winners of the election.[540] Pence demurred that the law does not give him that power.[541] Starting in December, Trump called for his supporters to stage a massive protest in Washington, D.C., on January 6 to argue against certification of the electoral vote, using tweets such as ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!""[542] D.C. police were concerned, and the National Guard was alerted because several rallies in December had turned violent.[543] On January 6, 2021, shortly after Trump continued to press false claims of election fraud at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., a crowd of Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol, interrupting the Joint session of the United States Congress where the Electoral College ballots were being certified and forcing lawmakers to flee the chamber. As part of an organized effort by Republican lawmakers to challenge the results in close states, the House and the Senate were meeting separately to debate the results of Arizona's election and accepting the electoral college ballots submitted. Several other challenges were also planned. Congress reconvened that same night, after the Capitol was cleared of trespassers, and leaders of both parties, including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Speaker Mitch McConnell urged the legislators to confirm the electors. The Senate resumed its session at around 8:00 p.m. to finish debating the objection to the Arizona and Pennsylvania electors were also considered. The joint session completed its work shortly before 4:00 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[544][545][546][547][548][549][550] The rioters entered the House and Senate chambers and vandalized offices. Five people died as a result: one person was shot by police, one Capitol Police officer died from a stroke after fisticuffs with rioters,[551] one person died of a heart attack, another of a stroke, and the final death is still under investigation. Trump was accused of inciting the violence with his rhetoric,[552] an accusation reinforced with an article of impeachment on January 13 for ""incitement of insurrection"".[553] Several commentators viewed the attack on the Capitol Building as an indicator of political instability that could lead to political violence in future elections, ranging from domestic terrorism to a second American Civil War.[554][555][556][557][558][559] On January 11, 2021, Representative Cori Bush filed a resolution calling for the possible expulsion of more than 100 Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives who voted against certifying results of the presidential election, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said the Senate Ethics Committee ""must consider the expulsion, or censure and punishment, of Senators Cruz, Hawley, and perhaps others.""[560] On March 31, 2021, the Republican caucus of the Arizona State Senate hired several outside firms to examine the results of the presidential and senatorial elections in Maricopa County, where Biden had won by a large margin.[561] There had been three previous audits and recounts of that county's results.[562] The examination was initially funded by $150,000 from the State Senate operating budget; additional funding was to come from outside sources.[563] In July the lead firm conducting the review released a summary of major donors, indicating $5.7 million was raised from five groups associated with individuals who had cast doubt on the presidential election.[564] The audit began on April 22, 2021, and was expected to last 60 days.[565] The investigation was still ongoing in August when a judge issued an order for the release of documents.[566] On September 24, a preliminary release of the audit claimed to have found minor discrepancies in the original, state-certified count, which had actually widened Biden's margin by 360 votes.[567] On May 10, 2021, over 120 retired U.S. generals and admirals published an open letter alleging that there had been ""election irregularities"", suggesting that the election had not been ""fair and honest"" and did not ""accurately reflect the ""will of the people"", and arguing for tighter restrictions on voting.""[568] On May 12, 2021, U.S. Representative Liz Cheney was removed from her party leadership role as Chair of the House Republican Conference, partially for continuing to assert that the election had been fair and that the election results were final.[569][570][571] Well into Biden's presidency, Trump continues to insist that he had actually won the 2020 election.[572] As of August 2021, surveys found that a majority of Republicans believe it.[573] A widespread rumor predicted that Trump would be somehow reinstated to the presidency in August 2021, although the predicted date of August 13 passed without incident.[574] Legend[575] Total television viewers

,"Biden battles Trump, lack of enthusiasm among Black voters","It is unclear if Black Americans will be energised to come to vote, potentially defining the outcome of the election. Racial inequality in the United States came into sharp focus this year, and became a defining topic of the national debate, after police killings of Black Americans ignited months of widespread protests and galvanised the nation to demand racial justice and police reforms. The unrest has forced US President Donald Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election on a “law and order” platform, and his main challenger, Democratic nominee Joe Biden, to wrestle with the complicated issue of race in America, and try to appeal to Black voters. But with less than two months before the election, in the middle of a pandemic and record-high unemployment rates, whether Black Americans will be energised to come out in large numbers to vote remains uncertain – potentially defining the outcome of the 2020 election. A recent poll shows Biden by far outperforming Trump among Black voters, with 78 percent support. “Most Black voters are going to support Joe Biden,” said Ravi Perry, professor and chair of the Department of Political Science at Howard University, a historically Black university. “But there are differences in enthusiasm,” Perry tells Al Jazeera, “where Black women, for instance, have far more enthusiasm towards Biden, and many young people, support him but with far less enthusiasm.” Earlier this month, both candidates visited Kenosha, Wisconsin, a battleground state, and the site of the most recent turmoil following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who remains hospitalised after being shot in the back seven times by a white police officer while authorities were trying to arrest him in late August. Speaking at a local church in Kenosha after a private meeting with Blake and his family, Biden said the latest events would help Americans confront centuries of systemic racism. In contrast, Trump did not mention Blake by name, refused to acknowledge systemic racism and instead blasted the protesters and offered his unequivocal support to law enforcement. Data shows that Black voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic Party since at least the 1960s, when the party passed civil rights legislation that outlawed racial segregation and prohibited racial discrimination in voting. But Black turnout, which rose in the 2008 and 2012 elections when the US elected and then re-elected the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, waned in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic presidential nominee. More profoundly, there is a growing level of cynicism among Black voters, pollsters have argued, particularly among young and male voters, and point to 2016 – when Clinton lost to Trump amid a six percentage points decline among Black voters – which proved critical in battleground states. Trump’s campaign this year has been trying to appeal to Black voters, particularly Black male voters and improve on his 2016 results, when 8 percent of Black people voted for him. According to a recent poll, 13 percent of Black voters said they plan to vote for Trump this election. Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury said, according to recent data he compiled, about half of Black voters believe the Democratic Party takes Black voters for granted and may choose to stay home or vote for Trump. “What we saw at the Republican National Convention was a very overt attempt to speak directly to the issues that are most important to Black men: criminal justice reform and unemployment,” Woodbury said. On the first night of the convention in August, the only Black Republican US senator, Tim Scott of South Carolina, relayed his personal success story, “Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,” he said. And Trump gave a full pardon to Jon Ponder, a Black convicted felon turned criminal justice activist. Several other Black speakers took the stage during the four-day event, including NFL players and a civil rights activist, and some touted Biden’s gaffe when he said that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” “The course of this election year will show that Black men are not a marginal part of his (Trump’s) strategy, but a path to victory,” Woodbury told Al Jazeera, “and he’s leaning into it.” And yet for many, voting Trump out of office, is a motivation on its own. Trump promoted the “birther movement”, alleging that Obama was not born in the US. He refused to condemn white supremacists and more recently, he allegedly called Black people “too stupid” to vote for him, according to his estranged former lawyer Michael Cohen. James Lance Taylor, a professor at the University of San Francisco, said many Black people will vote for Biden for no other reason than “to deal with the emergency of removing Donald Trump from office”. Many of the demonstrators who took to the streets after the police killing of George Floyd in May were making calls to “defund the police,” which would divert funds away from police departments and prisons in favour of investments in social services and re-examine what offences require a militarised response. Biden has said, “I don’t support defunding the police.” Instead, he has proposed a $300m investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities. According to a Gallup survey taken in July, 70 percent of Black Americans support or strongly support reducing police department budgets. But despite its popularity among Black Americans, strategists said if Biden backed the idea, he would run the risk of losing the support of moderate older white voters, a key demographic. “Defund the police may sound pretty good on Twitter, but to an awful lot of voters, including African Americans, it doesn’t make much sense,” Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist told Al Jazeera. “They want better policing, they want smarter policing, they don’t want the police defunded,” Manley said. Instead of embracing “defund the police,” Biden, who served as Obama’s Vice President for eight years, nodded to Black voters by choosing Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate, making her the first Black woman to be nominated on a major party’s ticket. “Black folks noticed and were excited by it,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. “There is a segment of our community that thinks Kamala Harris’ record as district attorney and attorney general is shaky,” he said in reference to her years as a prosecutor when she embraced a “top cop” label. “But the overall feeling is definitely that is a step in the right direction, a sense that he recognises us.” The coronavirus pandemic, a disease which has killed more than 192,000 Americans and disproportionately affected Black communities, has added an additional layer of uncertainty regarding how many and who will be able to cast their vote in November. Most states said they will expand their mail-in voting systems amid health concerns about crowds and long lines. It remains unclear how turnout will be affected. But for most, Albright says, the desire to see Trump out of office, casts an urgency on the importance of voting this year that will outweigh all other considerations. “Even among people who are not enthusiastic about Biden, people are more clear, now we know better,” he said, “We see what a Trump presidency looks like and how it is impacting our lives and our health.” Lim­it­ing im­mi­gra­tion has been a fo­cus for Don­ald Trump and Joe Biden is pledg­ing to re­verse many of Trump’s poli­cies. Out­come of pres­i­den­tial con­test hinges on mail-in bal­lots, vot­er en­gage­ment and the im­pact of coro­n­avirus.

,Trump vs. Biden: How COVID-19 Will Affect Voting for President,"JUNE 19, 2020 9 MIN READ Republicans’ and Democrats’ distinct responses to the pandemic could influence in-person and mail-in voting—and who wins BY GLORIA DICKIE Ira L. Black Getty Images (Trump); Mandel Ngan Getty Images (Biden) In late April Democrat Kweisi Mfume of Maryland won a special election for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in a landslide victory against his Republican rival. More remarkable than his win, which garnered three quarters of the vote, however, was that more than 110,000 Baltimoreans in the district cast their ballot by mail. Only 1,000 voted at one of three polling centers open there. In Georgia’s primaries in early June, more than one million voters used mail-in ballots, a huge increase over previous elections. In Wisconsin, voters are suing for greater access to such ballots because many polling places have closed in response to COVID-19—which has made it much harder to vote in person in the state’s primaries. These are just some of the political battles that have played out during the pandemic, when many people feel it is too risky to gather in public to do things such as vote in person. On June 2 eight states and Washington, D.C., held their primary elections, four of which had been postponed because of the disease. Half of the eight states had turnouts surpassing their 2016 levels—after taking extra efforts to ensure citizens received vote-by-mail ballots. But the others fell short despite such measures. Public health experts predict the coronavirus will still be a threat this fall. Americans can expect that some social distancing recommendations, such as staying six feet away from others and avoiding large gatherings, will remain during the November presidential election, in which Donald Trump will face off against Joe Biden. Political scientists say the ability to vote by mail, as well as attitudes about the danger of voting in person—which vary by party affiliation—could swing the contest. Election officials are implementing several fixes to allow people to vote safely, such as ramping up online registration and expanding mail-in voting. Rollouts of these measures across the U.S. have not been equal, however. And voting processes could differ from state to state come November. Some key swing states, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, do not automatically send out vote-by-mail ballots but require people to apply for them. Another 16 states only allow mail-in voting for people with a particular reason, such as a disability. Republicans have long asserted that voting by mail favors Democratic contenders. (Trump has also claimed, falsely, that such voting encourages fraud. Evidence shows it does not.) But Democrats have countered that the opposition comes because mail-in ballots make it easier for minorities, immigrants and young people to vote, and those groups tend not to vote for Republicans. For example, North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature placed limits on early voting after it found that African-Americans were more likely to vote early and to vote for Democrats. Theoretically, states with a robust vote-by-mail system and enthusiasm for ousting Trump could expect to see a blue wave in November, says political scientist Rachel Bitecofer of Christopher Newport University and the Niskanen Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Bitecofer’s predictions for the 2018 midterm elections were largely correct. Other political scientists say that if states do not implement expansive systems for such voting, Democrats—who, according to recent polls, are more fearful of the virus—might stay home. And that scenario would favor Republicans on the ballot. The pandemic will likely dampen large political rallies and conventions this summer, putting candidates in a tough spot: they have to keep Americans safe, but they also need to rally voters and build enthusiasm for their campaign. Trump insists that his rallies and the Republican National Convention will proceed despite the pandemic—and has now moved part of the convention to Florida after opposition to a fully attended event in North Carolina, reportedly without social-distancing measures, came from the latter state’s governor. Biden, however, has largely moved his campaign online and plans for the Democratic National Convention to remain fluid. TIM KEANE JEFF TOLLEFSON & NATURE MAGAZINE LAUREN LEFFER AMY MAXMEN & KFF HEALTH NEWS “I expect both campaigns will structure their campaign events to fit into their overall narrative about how the county should be responding to the COVID-19 crisis,” says Marc Meredith, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. “I also expect that the conflict between Trump and North Carolina’s governor over the [Republican convention] is a preview of the conflict that will repeatedly play out between the Trump campaign and state and local governmental officials—especially [in] Democratic states.” But Meredith says that campaigning’s impact on voter turnout is often overstated. A long-standing political science doctrine, called the minimal effects hypothesis, holds that presidential campaigns have a marginal effect on voting decisions. He does worry, however, that the pandemic will limit voter registration. Typically, volunteers with registration forms mill around political rallies, set up tables at college campuses or knock on doors in neighborhoods. Such in-person tactics will be very much reduced. “Door-to-door canvassing is one the most effective ways to mobilize nonvoters to become voters, as it generates social pressure,” Meredith says. A 2000 Yale University study found that personal canvassing substantially increased voter turnout. According to Bitecofer, such voter-registration efforts are key in deciding elections. Her model holds that turnout, not swing voters, ultimately determines who wins and who loses. With this situation in mind, campaigns will likely move to mobilize alternative techniques to target new voters by phone and online. Whichever camp can do so better could shift election results in its favor. Voting for president, unlike campaigning, cannot be done online. Mail-in ballots seem to be the obvious cure for an election plagued by a pandemic. Though studies of past elections indicate that voting by mail did not affect turnout to favor either Democrats or Republicans, 2020 is tilting that notion on its head. Thad Kousser, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, says he used to be dubious of the claim that mail-in voting hurts Republicans. But after he conducted a recent survey on electoral processes and the coronavirus—results were released in a preliminary, non-peer-reviewed paper on April 30—Kousser amended his stance. “I think we are seeing evidence of an emerging trend in which a new partisan divide is opening up over voting by mail,” he says. When Kousser asked both Republicans and Democrats about their most preferred method of voting, in absence of any information on the coronavirus, a higher percentage of Democrats said they wanted to vote by mail. When he asked the same question accompanied by scientific projections about the spread of the coronavirus, the partisan gap doubled. “Democrats and independent voters were much more likely to say they wanted to vote by mail after being reminded of COVID-19,” Kousser says. “But the Republicans don’t seem to be influenced by the scientific projections. There is clearly polarization when it comes to whether people believe COVID-19 is a significant risk and want to change their behavior.” He stresses, however, that his survey looked at people’s most preferred voting method and did not suggest that Republicans absolutely would not vote by mail. Rather it showed that if given an array of options, more Democrats than Republicans would choose mail-in voting during the pandemic. Five states—Oregon, Colorado, Utah, Washington and Hawaii—have already established all-mail voting, in which every resident is mailed a ballot automatically. In another 29 states and Washington, D.C., residents must actively request a mail-in ballot from election officials but do not have to give a reason. The six swing states of Florida, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all belong to this second group. The rest of the states have rules that only allow such voting if a citizen has a specific excuse, such as age, illness or disability. But several of them say they will allow more mail-in voting this year because of the pandemic.   These policies, particularly in the swing states, means a vote-by-mail partisan divide could significantly influence who becomes president. If less supportive Republicans don’t request a ballot in time or are unable to go to the polls in sufficient numbers, the Democratic candidate could claim victory in November. To underline this point: In one hard-fought primary race for Wisconsin’s Supreme Court, mail-in ballots favored a liberal candidate over a conservative one and suggested liberal Democrats voted by mail while conservative Republicans voted in person. A New York Times analysis found that the liberal-leaning candidate challenging for the seat generally performed at least 10 percentage points better than the conservative incumbent in such ballots. At one precinct in particular, the conservative justice garnered 64 percent of the Election Day vote, while the challenger took 70 percent of the votes cast by mail. Those mail-in ballots helped to carry the race for the liberal. Voting by mail may be especially important in November if the number of physical polling stations are reduced because of COVID-19. In the Wisconsin primary, only five of Milwaukee's typical 180 polling sites were open. Getting enough poll workers to sites may add to the trouble. More than half of poll workers in the last two general elections were age 61 or older, according to the Pew Research Center. And in the 2018 election 27 percent of such workers were older than 70. This group faces the greatest threat from the coronavirus and has been told all year to stay home to be safer. In both Wisconsin’s and Georgia’s recent primaries, fewer than usual workers showed up. The concern is reasonable: since the primary in Wisconsin, state health officials have identified 71 people who contracted the coronavirus from polling centers. To make mail-in voting work well for the November election, infrastructure will need to be ramped up in the 45 states that have not been automatically mailing ballots, says Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan research group that advises election officials. She adds that such efforts to bolster vote by mail need to start “immediately.” “There are a lot of parallels with the COVID-19 virus in terms of medical equipment,” McReynolds says. “If we’re not prepared, and in many ways the health care system wasn’t adequately prepared, then we’re scrambling to do it at the last minute. States need to evaluate what their needs are now and put those orders out.” States need to order things such as counting equipment (high-speed scanners that can process and count a huge influx of absentee ballots), new printers to produce mail-in ballots en masse and possibly ballot-sorting technology with signature verification, she says. Officials also need to ensure that Native-American voters on tribal lands, who may lack access to reliable mail service, can vote at sanitized, mobile polling units. Without the right equipment and procedures, there is already evidence from the primaries that states will run into trouble in November. In Indiana’s June 2 primary, state officials allowed residents to vote by mail. But some people who requested absentee ballots never received them. Election officials in Washington, D.C., also struggled to fulfill all the requests they received for mail-in ballots, forcing voters to wait in long lines at just 20 in-person polling stations that remained open. And in Pennsylvania, which passed legislation last year to move to a no-reason-needed mail-in approach, the system buckled under increased absentee-voting pressure. Thousands received the wrong ballot. And more than a week later, votes remained uncounted. Senate Democrats requested $2 billion in March for infrastructure to expand online voter registration, early voting and voting by mail. The amount was opposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. And in the end, the Senate passed a bill offering just $400 million for such expansion. A malfunctioning vote-by-mail system during the general election, when turnout will be much greater, could hurt Biden by making in-person voting more important. A preprint paper released in March found that Republicans were less likely to practice social distancing measures than Democrats, perhaps because of the same skepticism about projections of disease spread that Kousser found. “If Democrats are taking more precautions because of the coronavirus, we may see them not turn out as much as they would have without the pandemic,” says Shana Kushner Gadarian, the study’s co-author and a political scientist at Syracuse University. “That is pretty disturbing.” What the virus will actually do to November turnout for each candidate will not be known until after Election Day, of course. The early evidence from primary elections, combined with the results of national surveys, indicates that an expansion of voting by mail will favor Biden. Strong voter registration efforts by the Republican Party could still offset that advantage. And if states are unwilling or unable to bolster mail-in voting infrastructure—particularly in the six battleground states—and enough Biden supporters are too worried about the disease to vote in person while his opponent’s voters feel unhindered, the pandemic could pave the way for Trump’s reelection.

,Biden wants to win over young voters. They want him to do more about climate change,"JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: Vice President Kamala Harris is headed to the international climate summit known as COP28 in Dubai this weekend. The White House says President Joe Biden asked Harris to go to emphasize the importance of the conference and to showcase U.S. leadership on climate at home and abroad. But young people in particular have been pushing Biden to do more when it comes to climate. They have been calling for Biden himself to attend the global meeting. Here to talk about the politics around all of this is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hey, Mara. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Juana. SUMMERS: So Mara, why is the question of who will attend this summit so significant? LIASSON: Well, first of all, the purpose of the summit is to see if these big fossil fuel-consuming countries can meet their promises to keep the Earth from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Politically, who goes for the United States is important because this is an example of the difficulty Biden has had with young voters. Young people care very deeply about climate, about the state of the Earth that they're going to inherit, and the White House was feeling the pressure. A source familiar with the plans to send the vice president told our colleague Deepa Shivaram that that pressure made them decide to send Vice President Harris. So climate was a big part of Biden's campaign for president in 2020. He's taken some big actions related to climate change since then. He's in Colorado today actually talking about wind power. The Inflation Reduction Act that he signed put huge investments into climate policy - $370 billion. He doesn't get a whole lot of credit for that. But young voters want him to do more. They want him to solve problems and not just on climate. They want the high cost of housing addressed. They want the Israeli-Hamas war to be ended. They want student loan forgiveness. And they're frustrated that Biden can't do more. SUMMERS: I want to stick with the war here for a second because that is an area that has been another really big disconnect between the administration and young voters, right? LIASSON: Absolutely. The war in the Middle East is a motivating issue for young voters, young people right now. This is one place where Biden and young people pushing for an end to Israel's military actions are actually at odds. On climate, they agree. They just think Biden should be doing more. The Middle East is where there is a real policy difference between young voters, between voters of color - very important parts of the Democratic base - and the Biden administration. Whether this issue will hurt Biden next year depends on how long the Hamas-Israeli war lasts. But right now, it's showing some deep rifts inside the Democratic Party which could be a real problem for Biden. Now, climate is not going away. It's going to be an issue now. It's going to be an issue next year. We'll have to see how big of an impact it has on motivating young people to either vote for Biden, stay home or find a third party alternative. SUMMERS: OK, back to the summit. Vice President Harris is going to go. What has her role been in engaging with these young voters that the administration needs? LIASSON: The White House has used her as an ambassador to young voters, to the Democratic base, on a whole lot of issues. She's gone on the road. She's talked on college campuses about climate change, about abortion, about gun laws. It hasn't all been smooth for her. At one of her last stops, protesters were shouting about the administration's approach to Gaza. But it's just not clear if Harris is going to be the person to galvanize the youth vote. SUMMERS: I mean, young people were a huge part of the Biden coalition in 2020, as you know well. What does it mean in 2024 if they do not show up and vote? LIASSON: It means there's a huge problem for Joe Biden. This is really important. He is not at risk of losing young voters to Trump. He's at risk of young voters not being enthusiastic. This is going to be a close election, a turnout election. Biden needs every single base Democratic voter to show up at the polls. We know from polling that Republicans are already more enthusiastic about voting in 2024 than Democrats are, so Biden can't afford any apathy among his supporters. And, you know, having a voter who stays home or votes for a third party is really the same thing as losing a vote to Trump because the person who gets a plurality of votes in states is the one who wins all the electors. That's our system. It's not a popular vote system. That's why turnout and enthusiasm really matters. SUMMERS: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you as always.

,Black Georgian men helped Biden win the White House – are they losing faith?,"Some African American men in the key swing state are feeling neglected and are critical of the president’s support for Israel but others warn not to confuse enthusiasm with electability M
orehouse College, a 156-year-old Black men’s liberal arts college in Atlanta, Georgia, has produced graduates such as Martin Luther King and Spike Lee. It has been an essential campaign stop for Democratic politicians such as Barack Obama, John Lewis and, last September, Kamala Harris. But as another presidential election looms, Joe Biden can take nothing for granted here. “A resounding no,” was 28-year-old Ade Abney’s verdict on whether the US president has delivered on his promises to Black voters. “I voted for Biden in 2020 but next year I don’t know who I’m going to vote for. It probably will not be him.” Georgia is among half a dozen swing states that will decide the all-important electoral college next November. Despite its history as a bastion of conservatism in the south, Democrats have scored notable wins in presidential and Senate elections in recent years. African American voters have been fundamental to that success, with Biden securing 88% of the Black vote in 2020. But opinion polls suggest an erosion of support for the president. An October survey by the New York Times and Siena College found that, while 76% of Black voters in Georgia favour Biden, 19% prefer his likely rival Donald Trump – an unprecedented share for a Republican in modern times. It was enough to give Trump a six-point lead in the state overall. The current shift is particularly acute among Black men for reasons that include a perception that Trump would cut taxes and offer better economic opportunities. Abney, a Morehouse graduate who now works at the college, said: “I was in a barbershop and the barbershop conversation was how they like Trump. “The reason was at least when he was in office they felt as though they were able to make more money. A lot of people attribute that specifically to him. A lot of that conversation was pretty clear in terms of OK, well, I had more money when he was in office so I want him back.” Standing beside Abney at the tree-lined college entrance, Dejaun Wright, 23, offered even sharper criticism of Biden. “There’s a lot of broken promises, a lot of a lack of integrity,” the philosophy student said. “He campaigned on promises such as student loan forgiveness and every instance where he’s shown interest in that, he’s always applied a caveat: oh, well, I said student loan forgiveness, but I only forgive $10,000. “A lot of the things that he promised he’s offered either with a caveat or he just hasn’t offered at all. It’s a slap in the face. If you are going to build a campaign and then build a presidency off of lies, or at least not keeping your promises, then I don’t know if I can trust you again.” At liberal colleges such as Morehouse, there is also rising discontent over 81-year-old Biden’s staunch support for Israel, even as it unleashes an aerial and ground blitz against Hamas that is causing thousands of civilian deaths and a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Wright added: “I’m not appreciative of how vocal he’s been in his blind support of Israel. No sense of criticism there whatsoever. He’s actively been ignoring all of us. We’ve all been saying we don’t support this war in Israel. We don’t like our tax money funding a genocide like this, especially considering the amount of debt we have.” Black men do still vote overwhelmingly Democrat, and it’s only a small segment who might be turning away. In 2020 87% of Black men supported Joe Biden, which although down slightly from the 95% who voted for Barack Obama in his first campaign was better than the 82% who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. (Black women support Democrats even more strongly: in 2016 and 2020, 94% and 95% voted for Biden.) Only 12% of Black men voted for Trump in 2020 and no Democrat has attracted less than 80% of Black voters since the civil rights era. Small numbers could nevertheless make a big difference. Like Florida in 2000 or Ohio in 2004, Georgia has become a closely fought battleground that could decide the presidency. In 2020 Biden won the state by a margin of just 11,779 votes, or 0.24%, becoming the first Democrat to carry the state in 28 years. Trump’s false claims and efforts to overturn the result led to criminal charges and a potential trial next year. Democrats’ gains continued two months later, when Raphael Warnock became the first African American from Georgia elected to the Senate and Jon Ossoff became the state’s first Jewish senator. Last year, Warnock won re-election in a runoff against the Republican Herschel Walker, an African American former football star who failed to make significant gains among Black voters. But Stacey Abrams, bidding to become America’s first Black female governor, was defeated by the Republican incumbent, Brian Kemp. In the House of Representatives, the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene cruised to re-election. The state remains so finely balanced that even a fraction of Black voters switching to Trump, voting third party or simply staying at home on election day could make all the difference. Cliff Albright, a co-founder and executive director of the Black Lives Matter Fund, does not believe there is more of an enthusiasm gap now than at the same stage in 2019, when Black voters were unexcited about Biden. “People confuse electability for enthusiasm,” he said. “We weren’t that enthusiastic and we’re still not that enthusiastic. But that’s not news. “It’s just showing up differently because we’re a year out from the election. My prediction is that as we get closer, that pragmatism will set back in and people will start to realise more that this is not a referendum about Biden. This is a choice between this person and the one that we know is anti-us or somebody else who’s equally as bad.” Albright does not believe polls that say Trump will improve on his share of the Black vote next time. But he acknowledges that Biden’s handling of the war in Gaza could hurt him among young Black voters, especially with independent candidates such as Cornel West offering a clear alternative by demanding a ceasefire. “A lot of Black folks see ourselves in the Palestinian struggle,” he said. “A lot of us view that as a David and Goliath situation, a colonial situation. We see ourselves in what’s happening. When we see armed military using teargas and rockets and all that, we also see the George Floyd protests and ourselves going up against tanks and police forces. “There’s some very strong feelings about what many have called a genocide that is taking place in front of our eyes. Not only are you supporting the Israeli government’s ability to carry out this war but you are literally transferring more and more money so that they can do so. It’s not just political cover. It is actual financial and military support. He continued: “You get the Black folks, especially younger Black folks, that are like, ‘you keep saying you don’t have money for us but you’ve got money to go over here to kill some other folks that actually look like us.’ People can say, ‘oh, Trump would be worse,’ but that doesn’t change that what these folks are seeing right now is not Trump doing it. They’re seeing President Biden do it and so that is going to impact. “And many of these young folks, once they turn you off, you’re done. He could come back next month and increase the student debt cancellation. He could come up with some new gun legislation. He could go even further on some of the climate change issues. But many of these folks that right now are furious about what’s going on in Gaza, none of that would change their minds. They’re that mad.” Israel is not the only foreign policy issue weighing on Black voters. While his unwavering support for Ukraine’s war against Russian aggression – Congress has already allocated $111bn in assistance – has earned global plaudits, it appears to be playing differently in some African American communities. Kendra Cotton, chief executive of the New Georgia Project (NGP), a non-partisan organisation that works to empower voters of colour, said she didn’t think much of Ukraine until she “saw all of the African immigrants getting kicked off those trains. Then my eyes glassed over and I was like, this ain’t my problem and I didn’t want anything to do with it. “While I empathise with what’s going on in Ukraine, what I know is, if my Black behind was over there, they’d have kicked me off the trains too, so good luck to you.” She added: “We have people under these overpasses right here living in tents … People are trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents. “So, when you’re talking about billions in aid leaving the country, people don’t know how to qualify that in their minds: OK, but what are you doing domestically? Because when you talk about domestic issues, all you hear is we ain’t got it, there’s no money for that.” The NGP has registered almost 50,000 voters this year as it continues to fight voter purges in the state. In a September survey it found approval of Biden’s job performance down to just 61% among Black Georgia voters, and only 45% of Black 18 to 24-year-olds. Keron Blair, chief of field and organising for the NGP, argues that the White House has less of a policy problem than a communication one. He said: “I talk to people who’ve had thousands of dollars in student loans forgiven. We hear from people who got money directly into their pockets because of IRA [Inflation Reduction Act]. We hear from communities that have received resources for infrastructure. We see the broadband initiative. “That has not been communicated in a serious and strategic way to voters and so people are always going to ask, I voted last time, what happened? If they don’t know the things they are seeing and experienced are the result of choices made by the administration, they’re going to feel like not much has shifted.” Indeed, the gap between positive economic data and a sense of malaise on the ground is evident among Black voters. Gregory Williams, 37, a health coach, said: “The economy doesn’t feel like it’s strong. Everything feels out of whack. Inflation is crazy. Cities that are far out are expensive. Everything is just up right now. It’s hard to even get a loan for a house. Atlanta has the most evictions it’s ever had in its history.” Williams does not rule out voting for Trump. “It depends if he makes sense. He might not be saying what people want him to say but there’s a lot of things that he does and it seems like it helps. It gets a visual effect. People see things happening.” Jasper Preston, 35, a programme director at a homelessness non-profit, added: “Biden’s presidency has been an absolute nightmare for me personally. All the progress I made becoming more financially secure has been completely undone. I find myself worse off than during the Obama years and that has caused quite a setback. I have four children so it’s been very unpleasant trying to make ends meet.” Preston is a longtime Trump supporter who was ridiculed for it by his siblings living on the South Side of Chicago. But not any more, he said. “One privately gave me a call to very secretly admit that she is no longer a Democrat and will be voting for Trump in this upcoming election. She can’t tell anybody around South Side Chicago because, well, it’s South Side Chicago. “The same for my other siblings in Chicago as well as in here in Georgia. People are realising, ‘Oh, my wallet has definitely been drastically affected by this new administration, and all the promises they made based on skin colour turned out to be lies, and apparently promises about skin colour don’t make for a good president.’” In his victory speech after winning the 2020 election, Biden acknowledged that when his campaign was at its lowest ebb, African American voters stood up for him. “You’ve always had my back, and I’ll have yours,” he promised. In his inaugural address two months later, he named racial justice as one of four national crises that would take priority during his administration. While Biden has poured money into historically Black colleges and universities and appointed record numbers of people of colour as judges, efforts at police reform or to protect voting rights have stalled in Congress. When the president travelled to Atlanta last year to make his most aggressive case yet for reform of the Senate filibuster rule, some campaigners boycotted the event. Shelley Wynter, a conservative radio host and member of the Georgia Black Republican Council, said: “A Biden partisan person will tell you all these things that he’s done, but none of it was specifically for Black people. If Ukraine gets attacked and you can find billions and billions of dollars to send to Ukraine, you could have sent money into inner-city urban areas to say, ‘Hey, let’s do this.’” He continued: “If I vote for you and I’ve continuously voted for you and I’m the strongest, most loyal base of voters that you have, and you’ve still got nothing specifically for this group yet you can do stuff for other people, that’s why people are shifting, particularly Black men. “I equate what’s going on to what happens in a Black church. If you go to an average Black church, you’re going to see 90% women, a sprinkling of men. Most of those men are going to be older guys. Men are raised in a church and they see the ministers driving a Rolls-Royce while they are still in a hooptie struggling, and they start to get turned off and they stop going. “But their wives continue to go. That’s what the Democratic party is becoming: a party of Black women and a sprinkling of Black men, because Black men are going to Trump, they’re not going to the Republican party – and it’s a big difference.” Wynter argues that many have come view to Trump’s racism as a myth, empathise with his legal troubles and dismiss dire warnings that he would behave like a dictator in a second term. “It’s like, ‘I’m already living in a dictatorship, I’m already oppressed as a Black man, so all those things that they’re saying about Trump don’t resonate because I’m already there. “‘So now let me pay attention to the things that I really care about, which is my money, and this guy allows me to keep my money in my pocket. Tax cuts, less regulations for the entrepreneurial-spirited guy.’ That’s what they see. It’s a real tangible thing. ‘In 2019, I had X amount of money after I got paid every two weeks. Now I have less. It’s very tangible. I can see it, I can feel it. You telling me he’s evil? I can’t see or feel that. But I can see more money in my pocket.’” Democrats acknowledge the work that must be done to rebuild Biden’s 2020 coalition. Earlier this month his election campaign released a new ad, “List”, making the case that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act are helping people in African American communities. Despite worrying polls and signs of donor fatigue, the party is on a winning streak in recent elections and ballot measures on issues such as abortion rights. Back at Morehouse, there are still plenty of students keeping faith with the president. Damarion King, 18, studying political science, said: “I believe Joe Biden is doing a fantastic job, passing so many bipartisan bills. I don’t think his age is a factor in this election, at least for me. He’s doing the job. He’s doing his work for the people of America and I strongly support him.” King is sceptical that Black men who voted for Biden in 2020 will defect to Trump next year, not least because of the former president’s 91 criminal charges. “Anybody in the Black working class who’s saying that Trump is a better businessman is wrong. He’s gone bankrupt multiple times. He can’t be that great of a businessman.” ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/18/black-voters-biden-opinion-approval-georgia,
,AP: Biden breaks Obama's record for most votes cast for US presidential candidate,"        While it's too soon to know whether former Vice President Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States, the Democratic nominee has already reached a major election landmark.  As of early Wednesday afternoon, Biden had received the most votes for any presidential candidate in U.S. history with more than 70 million votes already tallied, according to the Associated Press count. Until now, former President Barack Obama held the record after he received 69,498,516 votes in the 2008 election. At the time, Joe Biden was his running mate. On Wednesday afternoon, the Associated Press count as of 2 p.m. Eastern said Biden received 70,238,852 votes, and it's still going. Ballots are still being counted in battleground states Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. RELATED: Presidential Election 2020: Live results from across the US RELATED: Presidency hinges on tight races in battleground states Millions of Americans cast ballots in a historically contentious election with few problems. About 103 million votes were cast before Election Day, an early voting push prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. That took some of the pressure off polling places on Tuesday, which generally saw short or no lines as coronavirus cases were on the rise. Daily confirmed cases were up 43% over the past two weeks in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Every Election Day comes with problems as millions of people try to cast ballots simultaneously in 50 states. But experts were relieved they were relatively rare at a time when partisan battles over voting reached a fever pitch. “We were bracing for the worst, and we've been pleasantly surprised,” said Kristen Clarke of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights. There were also only a few other issues with voting technology. Electronic pollbooks from voting equipment vendor KnowInk failed in Ohio’s second-largest county and in a small Texas county, forcing voting delays as officials replaced them with paper pollbooks. Those who did vote on Election Day included some who wanted to vote by mail but waited too long to request a ballot or didn’t receive their ballots in time. Election offices had to scramble to rejigger procedures to allow for a huge surge in mail voting as voters sought a way to avoid exposure to the coronavirus at the polls. Despite warnings of clashes between Trump and Biden supporters, there were no wide-scale instances of voter intimidation. Indeed, in battleground Michigan, demonstrators from the opposing camps initially shouted at each other through bullhorns outside a suburban Detroit polling place, but ended up joining together to sing “God Bless America.” There were reports, as there are every election, of efforts to discourage people from voting that surfaced in robocalls in a few states. The FBI was investigating. But there were no large-scale cyber attacks that upended voting. RELATED: FBI investigates Election Day 'robocalls' telling voters to 'stay home' Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, said in a statement that he was “confident the actions we’ve taken against adversaries over the past several weeks and months have ensured they’re not going to interfere in our elections.” Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.

,'They have not earned your vote': Trump allies urge Georgia Republicans to sit out Senate runoffs,"Allies of President Donald Trump's efforts to challenge last month's election urged Republicans in Georgia on Wednesday to stay at home for the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, arguing Trump supporters shouldn't take part in another ""rigged election."" Attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell told a crowd of Trump loyalists not to vote for either of the two Georgia incumbent Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue, during a ""Stop the Steal"" gathering in Alpharetta, Georgia.  The event, billed as a press conference but resembling the raucousness of a Trump rally, was filled with unfounded claims about  the election won by President-elect Joe Biden. Attention also turned to the two runoff elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate. ""Where is Kelly Loeffler here? Where is David Perdue?"" said Wood, who unsuccessfully sued Georgia seeking to stop the presidential election's certification. ""He ought to be standing right here. ""Do not be fooled twice,"" he added. ""This is Georgia. We ain't dumb. We're not going to vote on Jan. 5 on another machine made by China. You're not going to fool Georgians again. If Kelly Loeffler wants your vote, if David Perdue wants your vote, they've got to earn it."" Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide 'It has to stop': Georgia official calls on Trump to 'stop inspiring' death threats over election Georgia election officials have been under fire from Trump and his supporters after an initial state-ordered recount affirmed that Biden won Georgia by 12,284 votes. The Trump campaign requested a second recount, which was expected to be released Thursday. The remarks underscored the delicate politics the two Republican senators must navigate to turn out a base convinced the presidential election was stolen. Trump, who is holding a rally Saturday for Perdue and Loeffler in Valdosta, Georgia, has urged Republicans to vote for the senators even if they're upset with the presidential election outcome. But Wood said the Georgia senators must ""demand publicly, repeatedly, consistently"" for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to call a special legislative session to address the 2020 presidential election. ""And if they do not do it, they have not earned your vote. Don't you give it to them. Why would you go back and vote in another rigged election? For God's sake, fix it. You've got to fix it before you do it again."" Neither Loeffler, running against Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock, nor Perdue, running against Democrat Jon Ossoff, attended the rally. Kemp has said state law prohibits him from ""interfering"" with an election. 'Fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation':Georgia official says Trump supporters misled Wood delved into the Senate runoff elections after Georgia Rep. Vernon Jones, a Democratic lawmaker who had endorsed Trump during the campaign, repeatedly urged the crowd to ""hold the line"" by voting for Loeffler and Perdue. ""Now I love Vernon Jones,"" Wood said. ""Vernon Jones and I are more alike than different, but I'm going to disagree with Vernon Jones."" Powell, a conservative former prosecutor and former Trump attorney, doubled down on claims she has pushed for weeks that an algorithm flipped votes from Trump to Biden. She also urged Georgia Republicans to sit out the January election. ""There should not be a runoff, certainly not on Dominion machines,"" Powell said, referring to the voting machine company. ""I think I would encourage all Georgians to make it known that you will not vote at all until your vote is secure. And I mean that, regardless of party. We can't live in a free republic unless we know our votes are legal and secure."" She said  Georgia must adopt voter identification and paper ballots – both of which are already used in the state – as well as require thumbprints on absentee ballots. More:Attorney General Barr says Justice Dept. finds no evidence of fraud to alter election outcome At one point, Wood led chants of ""Do your job!"" aimed at U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who told The Associated Press this week that his department has found no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have changed the outcome of the election. Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting implementation system manager, said, ""We encourage all voters to vote in an election"" in response to the pleas from Wood and Powell. He said Powell lied when she said algorithms flipped votes, noting that a hand recount of the results reaffirmed Biden won the election by more than 12,000 votes. Sterling also said Powell lied when, in response to a question from the crowd, she accused the Georgia secretary of state's office of not conducting an actual hand recount. ""They lied to the people who are believing them to their face,"" he said. ""It's this kind of lying and this kind of rhetoric that is continuing to inflame passions on the ground unnecessarily, and it's wrong."" Reach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.

,"Trump Tells His Supporters Not to Vote in the Next Election, Which Would Actually Be Great for Humanity","  BY BESS LEVIN If you’ve lived through the last five years and haven’t been forced to medicate yourself to the point of unconsciousness, you’re probably aware that Donald Trump has been very bad for society, on account of the racism and the corruption and the mass casualties and the general, ongoing assault on democracy. Because of that, it would be ideal if neither the 45th president nor his acolytes sat at the seat of power ever again, though, unfortunately, that’s no sure thing. For one thing, Republicans have a shot at flipping the Senate in 2022, and there are a disturbing number of GOP lawmakers there whom Trump has wrapped around his morally bankrupt finger. For another, Trump is reportedly “laying the groundwork” for a 2024 run, and if you recall, 74 million people inexplicably voted for him in 2020, which wasn’t enough to actually win but was a disturbing number nevertheless. Obviously also at issue is that since Trump lost to Joe Biden, Republicans have responded by attempting to disenfranchise as many Democratic voters as possible. Allies of the former guy have been paving the way to meddle in future elections by passing bills that “allow Republican-controlled state legislatures or election boards to sideline or override local election administrations in Democratic strongholds,” which would, per The Atlantic, let state legislatures or their appointees interfere “in local decision-making, purge voter rolls, and manipulate the number and location of polling places. It would also allow Republicans in Arizona, Georgia, and elsewhere to do something Trump tried and failed to do in 2020: throw out ballots in rival strongholds in order to overturn a statewide result.” Which is bone-chillingly terrifying.

But you know what would be great? If somehow we could wave a magic wand and ensure that none of the people who support Trump or Trump-endorsed candidates show up to vote, which would be a tremendous turn of events for humanity, though one that would clearly never happen unless—what? What’s that you say? Donald Trump has, in an incredible self-own, told his base to stay home and not vote in the next two elections? This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Setting aside for a moment the idea of Trump instructing millions of people not to vote, which would have the obvious effect of helping the other side, it’s important to note that Trump is still—still!—clinging to the idea that the 2020 election was stolen and there is a chance it could be overturned and he could be “reinstated” at the White House. That’s extremely scary because, in case anyone missed it the first thousand times, there is absolutely zero evidence that fraud played a role in the last election, despite multiple attempts by conservatives to conduct “audits” of results in battleground states, which have thus far only proven how badly Trump lost. Nevertheless, we absolutely love the idea of Trump throwing a hissy fit and saying, “Oh yeah? You won’t overturn Joe Biden’s win? My people will show you!” First, because it underscores how very, very stupid he is, and second, because he and his allies have done this in the past and it predictably worked out great for Democrats. As the Daily Beast notes: After prominent Trump supporters similarly told Georgia Republicans to sit out the two runoffs in that state late last year, calling it “another rigged election,” voters ended up giving Democrats control of the Senate. As Kentucky-based GOP strategist Scott Jennings told Politico in January, “That’s on [Trump]. He told them their votes didn’t count, and some of them listened.” In a sad attempt to spin Trump’s directive as the exact opposite of what he said, GOP rally organizer John Fredericks told The Washington Post he thought Trump was simply warning voters that they need to get more involved to safeguard future elections, an explanation we’re sure the ex-president will blow up by clarifying that no, he specifically meant for people to stay home.

,Millions of Pennsylvanians skip every election. Here’s why this year could be different," Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are aggressively pursuing people who vote sporadically or have never voted at all. Melissa Durko, a baker, and her boyfriend, Drew Heaton, a chef, sit in the backyard of their South Philadelphia rowhouse. Neither will vote in the upcoming presidential election as a matter of principle. (Emma Lee/WHYY) Ask us: What do you want to know about voting and the 2020 election? Debra Beckey thinks the country needs change in November. In the 62-year-old Wynnewood resident’s mind, things have gone downhill under President Donald Trump. The rich aren’t paying enough in taxes. The coronavirus has spread unnecessarily. Democratic candidate Joe Biden deserves a shot, says the retired drug counselor. “I really think it’s time to get someone else,” she said. “I just don’t want to see Trump get in office again.” As a resident of a crucial swing state that could determine the presidency, Beckey’s vote is coveted. For months, political campaigns have been barraging people like her with fliers, commercials and online ads urging them to participate in the election. Beckey’s take would be good news for Biden — but there’s just one problem. She isn’t planning to vote. “A lot of times when I voted I got picked a lot for jury duty,” she said. “So I stopped registering to vote, and I don’t get picked for jury duty anymore.” There are millions of Pennsylvanians who, for whatever reason, make the same decision. Beckey is part of a group more populous in Pennsylvania than those who supported either Trump or Hillary Clinton in 2016: nonvoters. Neither the president nor the former Secretary of State garnered 3 million votes in the last cycle. But 39% of Pennsylvanians eligible to participate stayed on the sidelines — totaling nearly 4 million people. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are aggressively pursuing people who vote sporadically or have never voted at all — winning over even a tiny slice of that four million could help tip the state. A survey of Pennsylvanians who did not vote in 2016, found nearly half of nonvoters wanted to cast ballots on Election Day, but were held back by logistical issues — bucking the stereotype of nonvoters as people who are checked out of politics. Experts say this uniquely charged election, combined with easier access to mail-in voting, could get those nonvoters to come out to the polls in unprecedented numbers. “Interest is through the roof and the availability of mail-in participation options should more than offset any possible negative impacts of the pandemic,” said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. Your 2020 guide to voting in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania is dealing with a huge mail-in voting spike, sluggish mail, a slew of lawsuits and mail-in-ballot laws that could change. Here’s what you need to know. 3 years ago After the 2016 election, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study surveyed about 7,300 nonvoters nationwide about their political attitudes and actions, including 472 in Pennsylvania. Last summer, Susquehanna University political science professors Nicholas Clark and Rolfe Peterson published a paper analyzing why those nonvoters didn’t vote. For Keystone Crossroads, Clark crunched the Pennsylvania numbers alone. His finding: 45% of surveyed nonvoters said they wanted to cast a ballot, but did not due to personal reasons, including not being registered, having to work or being sick. “I don’t think [nonvoters] are apathetic and uninterested in what’s going on,” said Clark, whose findings mirrored the national analysis. “Some of those people are simply not able to vote.” Reading resident Cinthya Delarosa, 33, planned to vote Democratic in the local races last fall, but was derailed by an eviction notice she received the day before Election Day. “That voting day I couldn’t think about nothing but … where we were going to stay,” Delarosa told Keystone Crossroads in February.  Robert Giovanetti, 53, had never cast a ballot before he was convicted of felony perjury in 2012. The Lebanon County resident said someone during his trial told him that felons are not allowed to vote — a common misconception among the hundreds of thousands of people in Pennsylvania with felony convictions. Giovanetti grew up in a family of union steelworkers — all lifelong Democrats. But in 2016, he was swayed by Trump’s promise to revitalize the steel industry. That year, he stayed home on Election Day thinking he couldn’t participate. Now, he plans to cast the first vote of his life to reelect the president. “I feel a hell of a lot happier [that I can vote for Trump]” Gionavetti said. The Trump campaign is counting on turning out more people like Giovanetti this year to make up for expected losses in the suburbs. One recent study found that nonvoters in Pennsylvania and other key battleground states prefer Trump. Overall, Democrats maintain an 8.1% edge in registered voters in Pa., but that’s down from 9.5% last year.  “Our permanent ground game, combined with our unparalleled $350 million data operation, allows us to identify those Pennsylvanians who may not have voted in the last election but support all the President has accomplished in just his first term,” Trump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager said in a statement. But the Biden campaign thinks that this year’s contest is motivating left-leaning sporadic voters and nonvoters to action. The expansion of early voting options has opened the process to more people and early indications heavily favor Democrats. Of the nearly 670,000 Pennsylvanians who have already submitted ballots for this cycle, about 75% are registered Democrats. “No matter … if they’ve never voted before at all, Pennsylvanians from all walks of life are joining the Biden coalition,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Michael Feldman in a statement.

In 2016, Elliot Martin wasn’t particularly excited about either candidate running for president, but leaned towards voting for Clinton. However on election day the handyman, now 28, was traveling out of state. “There’s probably a good chance that I would have voted if I had been in Pennsylvania,” said Martin, who lives in Lancaster. “But I didn’t know how to [get] an absentee ballot.” This year, he’s already made a plan to be at the polls on November 3. “A lot of Trump’s decisions have been pretty gross to me,” he said. “That’s for sure inspired me to vote.” About a quarter of Pennsylvania’s 2016 nonvoters were classified in the Susquehanna University survey data as “conditional” — meaning they were interested in politics, but none of the candidates inspired them enough to cast a ballot. In 2016, Philadelphia resident Melissa Durko couldn’t bring herself to vote for a system she felt had failed her time and again — and that’s the case for her again this year. “If we were no longer in a two-party system … I would consider voting,” said Durko, 31, who wants to see the U.S. adopt a state-sponsored universal health care system. “It’s basically the same person with two different masks — that’s all that it is right now.” Durko and her boyfriend, who also does not vote, have been facing unprecedented pressure this year from friends, family, and even their roommate to vote for Joe Biden. She said that’s only solidified their commitment to staying home. “I feel this way because the political system is failing me,” Durko said, while running a white noise machine so her roommate would not overhear the interview. Researcher Nicholas Clark said Democrats and Republicans typically don’t make much of an effort to win over this kind of nonvoter. “If they’ve decided that they don’t like either campaign, there is not much that the campaigns can do,” he said. But that also might be different this year. In September, Pennsylvania Democrats convinced the state supreme court to boot the Green Party off the presidential ballot, leaving left-leaning voters without another option at the top of the ticket. That means Biden may secure more voters like Joshua Reaves, a 25-year-old organizer with the Philly Socialists. He’s turned off by Biden’s centrism and his opposition in the 1970s to federally-mandated school desegregation through busing. But, he said, he’s willing to do what it takes to get Trump out of office. “I think everyone I know is really disappointed by Joe Biden, but still plans on casting a ballot for him,” Reaves said, calling it a “marked departure” from what his friends did in 2016. About 5% of Pennsylvania’s nonvoters in 2016 were classified by the Susquehanna University report as being “obstructed”: they actually tried to vote, but were thwarted by something like long lines at the polls, an undelivered absentee ballot, or intimidation at the polling place. The other major group in the survey were classified as “apathetic” — those simply uninterested in the political process. About 18% of the surveyed nonvoters fell into that group. Four years ago, Avery Johnson was one of them. “I was very ignorant to [politics],” said the 25-year-old Philadelphia resident. A lot has changed since then. Last year, Johnson had a baby. Then, in May, her grandmother got sick with coronavirus. All the while, gun violence has exploded in her West Philadelphia neighborhood. Johnson is worried about the world her son is growing up in. She thinks President Trump’s downplaying of the pandemic and what she describes as a lack of respect for Black people is making things worse. Now, for the first time in her life, Johnson plans to go to the polls. On Nov. 3, she says she’ll push the button for Biden. “I don’t know if my vote can make a change, I’m not sure, but I have a son to look after,” Johnson said. “It’s worth a try.” WHYY is your source for fact-based, in-depth journalism and information.

,How COVID-19 Changed Everything About the 2020 Election,"I
n the 2020 that might have been, nobody is sick and politics is the center of the universe. The Democratic Party has just nominated Joe Biden and his running mate at its mid-July convention in Milwaukee, while Republicans are gearing up to renominate Donald Trump in Charlotte, N.C. At his usual rallies, Trump is pointing to the roaring economy to make his case for re-election, while Biden struggles to stir up crowds with his plea for a return to normalcy. Trump’s allies continue to promote conspiracy theories about the Biden family’s entanglements in Ukraine, leading increasingly desperate Democrats to push for a second impeachment in the House. Both parties are campaigning furiously across the country, knocking on millions of doors to turn out voters in November.    But in the 2020 that’s actually happening, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed everything–from how the campaign is conducted to how we vote to what we value. It has canceled conventions, relegated fundraising and campaigning to the digital realm, and forced many states to rapidly change how people get and submit their ballots, with unpredictable and potentially disastrous results. The acute crises have refocused the nation’s attention, bringing issues like public health and economic and racial inequality to the fore and prompting the public to revisit what characteristics it wants in its leaders. For four years, Trump has been the dominant force and inescapable fact not only of national politics but also of American life. Now he finds himself displaced as the central character in his own campaign by a plague that answers to no calendar, ideology or political objective. Just as the virus has changed the way adults report to offices and children go to school, upending whole industries in the process, it has spurred a massive shift in the fundamental act of American democracy: how we select the President who will be charged with ending the pandemic’s reign of destruction, dealing with its aftermath and shaping the nation that rises from its ashes. And as with so many other changes wrought by the coronavirus, the practice of American politics may never be quite the same again. This was always going to be an unusual contest–the high-stakes re-election campaign of a historically divisive President at a pivotal moment for the nation, a referendum on his norm-shattering style and disruptive vision, a test for his scattered opposition to prove which side of a polarized political spectrum represents the mainstream. As the campaign enters its final three-month stretch, Trump trails badly in national and battleground-state polls as Americans give his dismal handling of the pandemic a failing grade. But the end of Trump’s turbulent term will be written by the virus. It startled us with its rise and spread in January and February, suspended normal life in March and April, and lulled many into complacency before whipsawing us again with its resurgence in June and July. Who knows what kind of October surprise it may have in store? Like most things these days, presidential politics has adapted in ways that can get a little weird. For example, on Facebook one recent Thursday evening, Donald Trump Jr. is rhapsodizing with the aging former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka about childhood physical abuse. “Maybe a few more kids in this country need a little bit more ass whoopin’ than participation medals!” says Trump Jr., who wears an open-necked purple polo shirt and AirPods. Ditka, whose phone is tilted upward toward his bottle-brush mustache, looks confused. “How can you say that?” he replies. “These poor kids.” The broadcast, an installment of Trump Jr.’s Triggered podcast, epitomizes the content the Trump campaign is feeding hungry supporters online. On another recent evening, it hosted “The Right View,” in which Trump Jr.’s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump’s wife Lara, and Trump campaign aides Mercedes Schlapp and Katrina Pierson laud the debunked virtues of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID treatment in a segment that will eventually rack up more than half a million views on Facebook. The campaign was already creating such online content, but it’s newly central in a world where rallies risk becoming superspreader events. Sign up for the Inside TIME newsletter to get the exclusive story behind TIME covers. The Biden campaign has also moved online, where its presence, like its candidate, is more sedate and traditional. “Events” are advertised to local supporters and organized around constituency groups or issues, just as they would be in a normal campaign. Biden’s wife Jill appears, via Zoom, at a “virtual campaign stop” with the mayor of West Palm Beach, Fla., to talk about his plans for seniors; former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams hosts an online “racial and economic justice roundtable” with business owners in Detroit; Biden himself joins his former running mate, Barack Obama, for a stagey 15-minute “conversation” about the Trump Administration’s failures. Despite the pandemic, Trump had hoped to keep up the rallies central to his political mythology. But an attempted return to the stage in Tulsa, Okla., on June 20 turned into a debacle, with a sparse, mostly maskless crowd that barely filled the bottom deck of the indoor arena. Lately he’s settled for online “tele-rallies,” glorified conference calls that Trump supporters in key states are invited to tune in to a couple of times a week. At a recent one targeting voters in Maine and New Hampshire, Trump dutifully shouts out the local Republican candidates, extols lobster fishermen and vows to get tough on Canadian currency manipulation. Almost 13,000 people are listening live, and hundreds of thousands more will eventually “view” the half-hour audio stream. “The future of our nation will be defined by patriots who love our country and want to build it up and make it bigger and better and stronger–or it will be defined by the radical left. And usually radical left Democrats are left-wing extremists who hate our country,” he intones. In person, this kind of line would draw a roar from Trump’s throngs of admirers, but online, the only feedback is the silent scroll of Facebook comments. Trump’s political adviser Jason Miller says the tele-rallies have been a hit. “The genius of Donald Trump is that he knows how to foster and build one-on-one relationships with his voters,” he says. But it’s clear the virtual gatherings are no substitute for the real thing. Lacking his usual source of mass adulation, the President has taken to touting the crowds that line the streets when he visits various states on official business. Some local candidates–mainly Republicans–are still holding in-person events despite the risks. But the pandemic has become a vector for partisan attacks. When a GOP Senate candidate in Virginia posted a video of himself attending an indoor political event without a mask, the state Democratic Party seized on the image to call him “dangerously irresponsible.” Many state Democratic parties have chosen to hold all-virtual conventions, but several of their GOP counterparts have tried to blaze ahead. The Republican Party of Texas took its case all the way to the state Supreme Court, which sided with the Houston mayor who had canceled its in-person convention. The hastily assembled virtual confab that ensued featured extensive technical difficulties–at one point, Texas Monthly reported, pranksters invaded an online planning document and added “Peepeepoopoo” to the schedule–and by the end angry delegates ousted the state chairman. It’s been a similar story at the national level. Democrats decided early on that the planned July convention in Milwaukee would not be feasible; it was pushed back to mid-August and radically scaled down, with delegates staying home and voting remotely and Biden himself staying away. The GOP has had a bumpier road. In June, Trump moved the convention from Charlotte, N.C., to Jacksonville, Fla., in a fit of pique over the North Carolina Democratic governor’s insistence on safety protocols. As Florida’s COVID-19 caseload surged this summer, party officials made a series of frantic adjustments, culminating in a last-ditch effort to hold the festivities in an outdoor stadium in the August heat. Finally, in late July, Trump announced the Jacksonville program would be scotched; the current plan, which is still being developed, is to hold a small number of party meetings in North Carolina and have the President accept the nomination with a televised speech at a location to be determined. The lack of traditional conventions is perhaps not such a loss. Events where party insiders in smoke-filled rooms once actually picked presidential nominees and running mates have become, in the modern era, little more than infomercials. But they serve as a major engine of the parties’ fundraising–another operation that’s moved online in the age of coronavirus. The swanky catered affairs that donors once paid tens of thousands of dollars per plate to attend are now BYOB livestreams. Campaigns have had to get creative as the novelty fades. “When the stay-at-home orders started, campaigns immediately started doing virtual events–a Zoom fundraiser, a field-organizer hangout,” says Brian Krebs, who works at a Democratic digital-campaign firm called Rising Tide Interactive. “But the bar is rising now that a lot of people are Zoomed out. You’ve got to have a special guest or some kind of hook. People aren’t going to show up if it’s just 12 squares talking.” On the other hand, celebrity guests can be easier to land when they can appear at your fundraiser without leaving L.A. The Texas Democratic Senate nominee MJ Hegar recently recorded an event with the cast of Supernatural and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, none of whom were physically present. Hegar campaign volunteers have also gotten creative with their outreach, holding a voter-registration texting session that doubled as a Taylor Swift listening party. Around this time in an election, campaigns traditionally shift from registering, identifying and persuading voters to pushing them to the polls. The GOP is still doing so, knocking on a million doors a week, the Republican National Committee claims. But on the left, an intense debate has broken out about the ethics of going door-to-door amid a plague. Research suggests that in-person conversations with voters are the most effective way to get them to turn out. But most liberal groups and the Biden campaign aren’t planning on door knocking this year, viewing it as too risky for workers and voters alike. One group that forged ahead, the Progressive Turnout Project, had to suspend its operations in a dozen states after several employees tested positive for COVID-19. The irony is more Americans are eager for political engagement this year. In a Fox News poll in July, 85% said they were extremely or very motivated to vote, and the percentage of respondents who told Gallup they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting was up 10 points from 2016. Despite the difficulties of pandemic voting, primaries in states such as Texas and Georgia have set turnout records. At the same time, new voter registrations have plummeted because of the closure of government offices like departments of motor vehicles. In Pinal County, Arizona, a small progressive organization called Rural Arizona Engagement had gotten only a quarter of the way to its voter-registration goal when it had to stop canvassing in March. Attempts to continue the work by phone were mostly unsuccessful. Even though Arizona is currently a coronavirus hot spot, the group hopes to go back into the field to turn out the vote. “We feel like if we can follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and train our staff in a way that protects them and the people we’re talking to, this is a year that requires this work to be done,” says the group’s co–executive director Natali Fierros Bock. The pandemic, she says, has heightened people’s awareness of why their vote matters. (It’s also increased canvassers’ success rate: with so many people isolated in their homes, more are willing to answer the door and talk with a stranger.) Despite robust public support for wearing masks, the Pinal County board of supervisors decided against a mask mandate for businesses, and the rabble-rousing county sheriff, Mark Lamb, announced he would not enforce the state’s stay-at-home order. (Lamb was forced to cancel a planned appearance with Trump at the White House when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 in June.) “People are starting to connect the dots,” Fierros Bock says, “and consider who is serving in these local offices and how much power they wield.” The pandemic landed in the midst of America’s primary-election season, forcing state election officials to adapt on the fly. The results offer a glimpse of the massive challenges the general election will pose–and the disasters that could ensue. One of the first test runs came in Ohio, whose primary was scheduled for March 17, just days after the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic, the NBA abruptly suspended its season and states across the country began rapidly shutting down. When Republican Governor Mike DeWine sought to delay the primary, some candidates sued, and courts ruled he didn’t have the power to do so. Finally, at 4 a.m. on Election Day, with workers already starting to set up for balloting, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the state’s health director could order the polls closed as an emergency measure. But the GOP-controlled legislature wouldn’t go along with DeWine’s proposal to move the vote to June, so a mail-only election with an April 28 deadline was held instead. Other states soon had their own experiences with the logistical, constitutional and political complexities of pandemic voting. In Wisconsin’s April 7 primary–held on schedule after a last-minute standoff between its Democratic governor and Republican legislature–hundreds of polling locations were forced to close when poll workers fearful for their safety declined to show up. Hundreds of thousands of voters still turned out, standing in socially distanced lines for hours to cast their ballots. (One scientific study later tied the election to a surge in COVID-19 cases, though other researchers disagreed with that assessment.) Georgia’s June 9 primary melted down amid short staffing and technical problems, leading to endless lines and significant disenfranchisement that Democrats charged was an intentional bid by GOP officials to suppress the vote. In New York, a state that normally votes almost entirely in person, election officials blame an unprecedented flood of absentee ballots for the fact that more than a month after the June 23 election, they still haven’t declared a winner in some contests. In each case, the coronavirus struck at a system that was already fragile. “It is a mistake to think of the pandemic as something separate from other problems with our election systems,” says Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of California, Irvine. “It interacts with the existing pathologies to make things worse.” Hasen’s most recent book, Election Meltdown, was published on Feb. 4, the day after the calamitous Iowa Democratic caucuses, whose delayed results illustrated the problems balky election infrastructure can produce even without a worldwide epidemic. Many states that have been administering elections in person for decades are now attempting to pivot to mail voting, allowing people to vote absentee without an excuse or by citing COVID-19 as a legitimate medical reason. But not all. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Democratic lawsuit that sought to allow all Texas voters to choose mail ballots. In Georgia, the GOP secretary of state mailed every voter a ballot application for the primary but will not do so for the general election. “I think it’s because there was historic turnout, particularly among Democratic primary voters, and [Republicans] don’t want to encourage that in the general election,” says Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project. Some states, including California, Nevada and Vermont, will mail ballots to all voters, joining five existing states with universal mail voting. Many others will send all voters an absentee-ballot application, but experts warn they may not be prepared for the flood that is coming. Postage, postmark and notarization or witness requirements vary widely from state to state. States facing pandemic-induced budget crunches aren’t necessarily in a position to pay for protective equipment and millions of stamps, but Congress has allocated only a fraction of the election funding they’ve requested. The U.S. Postal Service, itself teetering on the brink of insolvency, is ill equipped to handle the surge, and Democrats allege the popular agency, recently entrusted to a Trump ally, may be intentionally slowing the mail in urban areas in order to help the President. States’ voting procedures continue to shift as the vote nears, making it difficult for voters to keep track of what’s required. What worries election experts the most is that all these challenges and changes could throw the result into doubt. Barring a blowout, election night is likely to end without a clear winner, and it could take weeks or months to count all the votes. “What we didn’t see in the primary, even where there was confusion or it took weeks to count, was someone calling the election rigged or stolen,” says Aditi Juneja, an attorney who staffs the bipartisan National Task Force on Election Crises. “We want to make sure that happens in the general election. If the outcome is unclear or uncertain, that leaves space for bad actors to make wild claims.” That, of course, is exactly what Trump has been doing. Continuing the drumbeat he began in 2016, the President has repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the vote, wrongly insisting that mail voting is not secure and that the election will be “rigged.” Trump claims there is a difference between vote by mail, which generally refers to ballots mailed to all voters, and absentee voting, when voters typically must request a ballot. But experts say there’s no difference in terms of security. Trump attacked Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, for going “rogue” when she mailed absentee-ballot applications before the state’s primary–a step many of her GOP counterparts had also taken. “It is not helpful when false or misleading information, mudslinging and partisan rhetoric are injected into the discourse,” Benson tells TIME. “It causes people to have doubts about the sanctity of the process and the validity of their vote. The truth is, we are working every day to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat.” On July 30, Trump suggested postponing the presidential election, prompting an immediate outcry from Republicans and Democrats alike. “The concerns the President has raised are not valid in the state of Ohio,” Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose, a Republican, tells TIME. “Both political parties in Ohio have trusted our system for 20 years and work hard to get voters to take advantage of voting by mail.” As for postponing the election, “That is not something we should even be considering,” he says. Election experts of both parties worry that Trump’s pernicious campaign to undermine confidence in the election’s integrity is a pretext for refusing to accept the result if he loses, throwing the nation into constitutional crisis or worse. When a bipartisan group of academics and former officials called the Transition Integrity Project recently war-gamed a contested election, every iteration of the exercise produced “both street-level violence and political impasse,” the group’s organizer, Georgetown Law professor Rosa Brooks, told the Boston Globe. When the reality of the pandemic began to set in, Trump’s approval rating initially went up, as often happens for Presidents in times of crisis. The percentage of Americans who approve of Trump–which has stayed within a narrow band throughout his term–reached 46% in late March, the highest level since his Inauguration, according to the polling average maintained by FiveThirtyEight. Then it began to plummet. Today, barely 40% approve of Trump’s performance, while nearly 55% disapprove. Americans now disapprove of his handling of the pandemic by a 20-point margin. Biden holds significant leads in key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Florida and Michigan. States such as Texas, Arizona and Georgia, which Democrats haven’t won at the presidential level in decades, may now be up for grabs. Many top Republicans fret that their candidates are in for a wipeout up and down the ballot. “The breadth and depth of Trump’s weakness is hard to overstate,” says Democratic pollster Margie Omero, a member of the Navigator Research team that has surveyed more than 24,000 Americans on a rolling basis since March. “There was a little bit of rally-round-the-flag at the beginning–people wanted him to succeed–and then when it was clear that he wasn’t taking it seriously, you saw that change.” In truth, Trump was an unusually weak incumbent long before the pandemic hit, the only President never to top 50% approval in Gallup’s regular tracking. His current rating remains higher than his nadir of 35% in August 2017, after the white-supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. Democrats’ current 8-point advantage on the generic ballot is about the same as their margin in the national vote in 2018. Biden has consistently held an edge over Trump, posting margins similar to or greater than the current state polls since before he even entered the race. A large portion of the American electorate seems to have made up its mind about this President early on, abandoning him–and his party–and never looking back. Indicators that normally correlate to incumbents’ political fortunes, such as the economy, may not apply this year, says GOP pollster Patrick Ruffini. The situation is simply too anomalous. Many people see the pandemic as a fluke wrought by China, and may be receptive to the argument that the economic pain is not the President’s fault. Trump may also be benefiting from the popular emergency economic relief legislation Democrats helped him enact. “The country can unite behind its leaders in a crisis if they feel like things are at least moving in the right direction,” Ruffini says. “The summer’s case spike seemed to break off that possibility for the President. He’ll still have a chance to show that things have turned a corner before November, but time is running very short.” COVID-19 has changed the tenor of the election in unmistakable ways. Optimism has nosedived: the share of people who believe the U.S. is on the right track has declined 20 points since March. The pandemic has brought new urgency to issues like access to health care, inequality and the social safety net, while driving Trump’s preferred topics of immigration and trade out of the picture. “The voters are fundamentally the same, but the context of the 2020 election has changed,” says UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, author of Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America. Trump’s character flaws suddenly loom larger for voters. “For a long time, it was annoying but it didn’t necessarily change anything in their lives–‘I wish he’d stop tweeting, but the economy’s good,'” says Lanae Erickson, senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, which commissioned polls and focus groups of thousands of voters in suburban swing districts. “What this has done is to put the perception they already had about Trump together with real, horrific impacts on them and their family and their country.” Asked an open-ended question about Trump’s vision for the country, about half the respondents in Third Way’s surveys volunteered “self-serving” or “divisive.” Respondents also rejected his calls for “law and order” in response to street protests. Asked who is hurt by Trump’s vision, 30% of undecided suburban voters said “all of us.” “It used to be people would say LGBT people, or women, or people of color,” Erickson says. “Now, 4% say immigrants, 6% say minorities–but 30% say all of us.” Some focus-group participants were asked what they were looking for in the election. The responses were heavy on leadership qualities: people yearned for someone who was strong, compassionate and listened to experts. People agreed that Trump was strong (and questioned Biden’s strength) but rated the President abysmally on the other two. Just as Trump’s worst qualities were magnified, Biden’s strengths suddenly seem matched to the moment. When he announced his candidacy a year ago, he said he was compelled to run by Trump’s equivocal response to Charlottesville. Some Democrats criticized his mantra of a “battle for the soul of the nation” as too puffy or vague at a time when his rivals were pumping out ambitious left-wing policy proposals. But a character-based campaign, tinged with nostalgia, now looks not just prescient but essential, whether or not you believe Biden has what it takes to deliver on it. Trump’s campaign insists he is positioned for victory despite the headwinds. Public polls are undercounting Republicans, says Miller, the Trump political adviser, and the President’s supporters are more enthusiastic about voting by a 2-to-1 ratio. “Are people going to stand in line for two hours to vote for someone they’re not enthusiastic about?” he asks. But analysts in both parties are skeptical. “Overwhelmingly, voters believe the pandemic and the resulting economic meltdown are the most important issues facing the country,” says GOP pollster Whit Ayres. “Efforts to change the subject might work with people who are already in favor of the President, but there’s no evidence they’re working with the people who need to be brought into his coalition if he’s going to win.” If the pandemic has revealed the fault lines in American society, it has exposed something else too: some things are still too important to get caught up in politics. Trump’s attempts to make public health a partisan matter have mostly failed. Large majorities of Americans support their states’ pandemic restrictions, believe it’s more important to rein in the virus than to get the economy up and running, think more needs to be done and–by resounding margins–support mask wearing. The national mood has undergone a wholesale shift in this most tumultuous of election years. In Third Way’s studies, voters talked about feelings of sadness, anger, anxiety and fear. Pollsters’ response rates have skyrocketed because so many lonely, homebound people are answering the phone just to have someone to talk to. America is a divided nation, but also one that craves communion and solidarity. When a Black man was brutally murdered on video by police in Minneapolis, people took to the streets in unprecedented numbers. Three-quarters of Americans said they backed the recent racial-justice protests, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement surged, stunning political observers. It’s hard to imagine this happening without Trump. But it’s hard to imagine it without COVID-19 too. When one day Americans look back on this plague, the campaign it coincided with will be an inextricable part of the story. The U.S. has held elections under difficult circumstances before: wars, depressions, natural disasters. Each time, in the face of difficulty, we voted on schedule; each time, democracy gave us the opportunity to choose how we would steer out of the crisis. –With reporting by MARIAH ESPADA and ABBY VESOULIS Correction, August 6 The original version of this story misstated the location of the celebrity guests at a MJ Hegar virtual event.

Bill McKibben,"Instead of Challenging Joe Biden, Maybe the Green Party Could Help Change Our Democracy","  To distract myself from wondering if my chest is tightening, I sometimes think about other things that could go really wrong this year. The list is long, but somewhere near the very top is the thought that the President could somehow eke out a close election victory, despite—well, despite everything. There’s no guarantee it won’t happen. The Democrats didn’t find a perfect candidate, and there’s going to be an endless blizzard of Facebook lies, and team Trump is topnotch at voter suppression. But there are ways to lessen the odds a little, and a good one would be to not have a third-party challenge from the left this year, at least in the six or seven battleground states that are going to make the difference. That means asking the Green Party to stand down in those places. People with impressive left credentials—Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, Ron Daniels—did this already, in January, in a well-argued open letter. But it didn’t seem to work: the Party’s most likely Presidential candidate, Howie Hawkins, declared that he would run even if the Democrats nominated Bernie Sanders, who, Hawkins told an interviewer, had been “a little slow” in his plans for reform. Hawkins has run many times for governor of New York, and also for the House and the Senate from that state, while never getting more than five per cent of the vote. (He did come in a respectable second in a Fourth District city-council race in his home town of Syracuse, in 2013.) “Recognizing the danger of Trump does not mean that electing any damned Democrat should trump all other considerations,” Hawkins said. So I probably won’t be able to persuade him, either, but let me at least offer the suggestion that there’s a particularly useful reform that Greens—and others interested in a more vibrant politics—could be working on, instead, this autumn. To understand why this reform—ranked-choice voting—seems so important to me, let me say that, by ideology, I’m pretty much a Green. One of my favorite politicians anywhere is Bob Brown, a former member of the Australian Senate, who, in 1972, helped found what was arguably the first Green Party (and also saved a large portion of Tasmania’s classic wilderness). I’ve given speeches on behalf of German Greens and European Union Greens and local Green parties in many states and cities, and, whenever Canada holds an election, I stay up to watch the returns from the island district in the Pacific, off Vancouver, just to make sure that Elizabeth May, who for many years led the nation’s Green Party, has retained her seat. So I’m about as small-“g” green as green gets, having spent my adult life working on the greatest environmental crisis in the history of our civilization, the rapid heating of our planet. But I haven’t supported the Green Party in national elections in this country, and that’s because of the way our electoral laws work. The obvious difference between the United States on the one hand and most of Europe on the other is that we have a de-facto plurality-winner-take-all two-party system that makes it all but impossible for a small party to make a non-perverse difference, while European countries have parliamentary systems with electoral mechanisms that encourage small parties to play constructively pivotal roles. Time and again, by winning five or ten or twenty per cent of the vote, and a like share of seats, the Greens who operate in parliamentary democracies have ended up with enough representatives to give them bargaining power when it came time to form coalition governments. And those bargains make big differences: having the Greens in a power-sharing government was a major reason that Germany pioneered renewable energy; currently, in British Columbia, a Green-Liberal coalition has bolstered opposition to giant pipelines. In the United States, winning a few percentage points of the vote gets you nothing, except a chance to argue about whether you were the spoiler. Ralph Nader, in 2000, and Jill Stein, in 2016, have roundly insisted that they weren’t, arguing that the Democrats who were defeated in crucial states by margins smaller than their vote totals there did not run skillful enough campaigns. Relitigating that history seems less essential than looking ahead: the last poll I saw for Wisconsin showed that the race between a Democrat and Trump, for the state that many analysts predict will sway the election, was currently within three percentage points. So, if a Green Party candidate is on the ballot and attracts even a smidgen of support—well, it could end very badly indeed. And why would you take that chance this year? That’s not to say that America wouldn’t be better off with more electoral alternatives. We clearly would. And to get them we needn’t wait for some unlikely constitutional change that might produce a parliamentary system. Instead, we can work to get more states to follow the lead of Maine, which last year introduced a ranked-choice voting system for most elections. Here’s how it works: if there are ten candidates on your ballot, you list your choices from one to ten. You can proudly vote for the Green candidate as your No. 1 choice for Congress, and, if she comes in last, you haven’t lost your vote or spoiled someone else’s chances. That’s because that vote would then be eliminated and your second-ranked vote would be counted instead, and so on, until someone has won a majority. VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER A Reporter’s Video from Inside the Capitol Siege This is not some impossible dream of a reform—pundits used to say “as Maine goes so goes the nation,” and, indeed, last year, after Maine adopted the plan, so did New York City, with the support of seventy-three per cent of its voters. “Before the pandemic, R.C.V. was gaining momentum, with efforts teed up in several states to advance it via ballot initiative or legislative lobbying,” Josh Silver, the director of the electoral-reform campaign RepresentUs, said. “A ballot initiative for R.C.V. is likely in Alaska this year, and possibly in North Dakota and Massachusetts. There is a huge opportunity for legislative lobbying efforts in many other states, blue and red, as evidenced by the deep-red Utah legislature’s vote to allow their cities to enact R.C.V.” That is to say, Green enthusiasts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania could skip Presidential campaigning and, instead, push their legislatures hard to put R.C.V. on the agenda. The pandemic has only increased the urgency, because the one drawback of a now necessary vote-by-mail system is that candidates sometimes drop out of elections after you’ve mailed in your ballot. Silver again: “This happened to millions of voters in this year’s primary, and R.C.V. fixes it. We must lean in hard to this opportunity.” If we managed to enact this reform, the result would be a much better system in many ways. One is that you could really build small progressive parties without potential supporters worrying that they’d inadvertently elect Trumpish figures; if the Greens, or any third party, are ever going to have a real breakthrough on a national level, it will be because people can vote for them without fear, real or imagined, of being a spoiler. But there’s another reason, too, which I got to see close up while covering elections as a young city-hall reporter in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which for decades was the only major city in the country to use R.C.V. It’s that these elections not only allow for more ideological diversity but also tend to reduce the truly hateful divisiveness that’s become such a feature of our elections. If you’re a candidate in a ranked-choice election, you have a strong incentive not to be a sneering jerk to your competitors, because that kind of behavior reduces your chances of getting crucial No. 2 votes. You have to make your case, and you have to at least understand someone else’s. Obviously, campaigning for R.C.V. is less sexy than campaigning for President, and it will take a little while (though the whole Green Party project seems premised on a kind of radical patience). If the Party insists on running a Presidential candidate in the few states where it really matters, I hope people will not waste their votes on them. That’s not because I think Joe Biden is a hero; it’s because I think he’s not only better than the alternative but also pushable. Politics doesn’t end on Election Day—if you’re serious about change, politics in some ways begins once the votes are counted, with the less exciting business of prodding politicians to keep promises or opening up the political space for them to do what they want. In that world, which is always the real world, the job is to elect a politician whom you have a chance of pushing, one who might take advantage of openings that movements can provide. So, for instance, I had no problem working hard to elect Barack Obama as President (and Joe Biden as Vice-President), and also no problem helping gather some of the largest demonstrations of their Administration outside the White House. We were pushing for Obama to keep his pledge to be a climate activist by opposing the construction of the Keystone Pipeline; he eventually came on board. That was a hugely important development in the fight against climate change—and it launched similar movements around the world. With Trump’s election, of course, that kind of opening ceased—there’s no point pushing someone who takes pride in destruction. Now, there’s a very real chance that the pipeline will be built. Magnify that scenario across all the issues of the day and you see why most climate activists I know just shake their heads at the thought of a third-party challenge this November. It took me a while to reach that point. In the first Presidential election I ever voted in, in 1980, I voted for Barry Commoner, of the Citizens Party (albeit in the safely blue state of Massachusetts). But the results of that and subsequent elections convinced me that Americans would do well to avoid third parties at the national level until our electoral structure shifts. That’s why, I think, Bernie Sanders has run for President as a Democrat and has always insisted that he would support the Party’s eventual nominee. As he told Biden on Monday afternoon, in his endorsement announcement, “I’m asking every Democrat, I’m asking every Independent, I’m asking a lot of Republicans to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy.” (He has also shown that you can change politics in dramatic ways from within the Democratic Party.) After Sanders lost in 2016 Democratic primary, I campaigned strenuously for Hillary Clinton across the swing states of the Midwest, and it was there that I began to worry that the Green Party was doing just well enough to threaten real trouble. So, that October, I wrote about the importance of voting for Clinton, even if she wasn’t your first choice. I don’t want to wait that long this time, and I know from reading the work of such long-standing Green activists as Ted Glick that there’s an active debate within the Green Party about the wisdom of competing in this year’s Presidential election. I hope it’s never necessary to write any take on this subject again. And not because the Greens or other idea-oriented parties disappear but because we rebuild our electoral system in easily doable ways that would allow for better elections.

,Biden blasts ‘un-American’ voting limits; Texas Dems act," President Joe Biden delivers a speech on voting rights at the National Constitution Center, Tuesday, July 13, 2021, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)          PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Joe Biden declared preserving voting rights an urgent national “test of our time” on Tuesday but offered few concrete proposals to meet it. Texas Democrats took their own dramatic action to stymie Republican efforts to tighten ballot restrictions in their state. Biden, who has proclaimed protecting ballot access the central cause of his presidency, has faced sharp criticism from allies for not doing more, though political headwinds and stubborn Senate math have limited his ability to act. Despite his ringing words Tuesday, he avoided any mention of trying to alter the Senate filibuster rule that stands in the path of federal legislation. Speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Biden called state efforts to curtail voting accessibility “un-American” and “un-democratic” and launched a broadside against his predecessor, Donald Trump, who baselessly alleged misconduct in the 2020 election after his defeat. Biden called passage of congressional proposals to override new state voting restrictions and to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that were curbed in recent years by the Supreme Court “a national imperative.” Yet, instead of raising the possibility of fighting the filibuster, he appeared to tacitly acknowledge the fading hopes for the bills, saying he would launch a nationwide campaign to arm voters with information on rule changes and restrictions ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. “We have to prepare now,” the president said.  Biden’s sharp rhetoric drew praise from progressive groups in his party but did little to assuage the mounting pressure on him to throw his weight behind replacing the filibuster. “The president believes that we have to make the filibuster work the way it used to,” said White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who added Biden has not changed his opposition to eliminating it altogether. Biden’s remarks came a day after Texas Democrats decamped for Washington in an effort to deny their GOP-controlled Legislature the necessary quorum to pass a bill placing new restrictions on voting in the state. The lawmakers, who arrived in the nation’s capital Monday night, said they were prepared to stay in Washington — out of the reach of Texas law enforcement — until a special legislative session concludes early next month. Their action marks a dramatic new showdown over voting in America. Standing near the steps of the U.S. Capitol for a news conference ahead of a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democrats promised to “stay out and kill this bill.” However, state Rep. Chris Turner, the leader of the Texas Legislature’s House Democrats, said their efforts would ultimately be futile unless congressional Democrats take bolder action to overcome a Senate Republican blockade of the sweeping federal voting bill. The legislation, known as the For the People Act, would create national standards for voting that could roll back some of the restrictions that have been approved or are advancing in Republican-led states, including Texas. “We can’t hold this tide back forever. We’re buying some time. We need Congress and all of our federal leaders to use that time wisely,” Turner said. Several states have enacted new voting restrictions, and others are debating them, as the GOP has seized on Trump’s false claim of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election as a rationale for curtailing ballot access. “No other election has ever been held under such scrutiny, such high standards,” Biden said of the 2020 race. Some GOP-led states have worked to roll back the vote-by-mail expansion that was put in place in the past presidential election due to COVID-19 fears. Others have tried to strengthen voter identification requirements and curtail hours and locations for early voting and ballot drop-offs. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he would keep calling special sessions through next year if necessary to pass his state’s legislation, and raised the possibility of Democrats facing arrest upon returning home. Asked whether Biden thinks the Texas legislators are doing the right thing by leaving the state, Jean-Pierre said “he applauds their courage.” She said that in the administration’s view, the Texas bill is an “assault on democracy.” Vice President Kamala Harris, who is leading the administration’s efforts on voting rights, praised the Texas legislators during a meeting with them in Washington. “Defending the right of the American people to vote is as American as apple pie,” she told the lawmakers, comparing their actions to women’s suffrage and civil rights marches. Democrats on Capitol Hill have tried to respond with a sweeping federal voting and elections bill that Senate Republicans have united to block. Most Republicans have similarly dismissed a separate bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore sections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court has weakened. Those roadblocks have increased focus on Senate filibuster rules, which, if left in place, would seem to provide an insurmountable roadblock, requiring 60 votes in the evenly split, 100-member chamber to even bring up controversial legislation. Moderate Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona also have so far expressed reluctance to changing the Senate rules. Many Democrats have expressed frustration with the lack of a greater White House push to change the filibuster, with civil rights activists stressing that Biden was elected with broad support from Black people whose votes are often put at risk by voting restrictions. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended Biden’s address, called it a “good speech,” but also said, “I told him that I was going to stay on him about the filibuster.” He described Biden as noncommittal on the issue. Biden, himself a veteran of the Senate, has offered some support for filibuster changes. But he has not put his full political weight behind the issue, believing it counterproductive in both the legislative and political fights over voting. He and Harris met last week with some of the civil rights leaders, who made clear that they expected a legislative solution. “Our backs are against the wall. This is the moment. We have no more time,” said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, after the meeting. “I told the president: We will not be able to litigate our way out of this threat to Black citizenship.” “Administrative action, litigation, and organizing are critical to combat this, but these tactics are not a substitute for congressional action on the For the People Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,” Karen Hobert Flynn, president of the group Common Cause, said Tuesday. “As the president ramps up his use of the bully pulpit and engages with senators, we urge him to make clear that the Senate minority’s use of the filibuster—a Jim Crow relic, in the words of former President Obama—must never stand in the way of the freedom to vote.” Although not abandoning hope of legislative action, the West Wing has been shifting focus to other measures to protect voting, including legal remedies pursued by the Justice Department and action in individual states, according to officials. There also will be an emphasis on boosting voter turnout, with aides pointing to success Democrats had in getting out votes last year during the height of the pandemic. Officials concede, though, that turning out voters is always harder in a nonpresidential election year. —- AP writer Darlene Superville contributed from Washington.

,CMV: Not voting for Biden in 2024 as a left leaning person is bad political calculus," Biden's handling of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts has encouraged many left-leaning people to affirm that they won't be voting for him in the general election in 2024. Assuming this is not merely a threat and in fact a course of action they plan to take, this seems like bad political calculus. In my mind, this is starkly against the interests of any left of center person. In a FPTP system, the two largest parties are the only viable candidates. It behooves anyone interested in either making positive change and/or preventing greater harm to vote for the candidate who is more aligned with their policy interests, lest they cede that opportunity to influence the outcome of the election positively. Federal policy, namely in regards for foreign affairs, is directly shaped by the executive, of which this vote will be highly consequential. There's strong reason to believe Trump would be far less sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than Biden, ergo if this is an issue you're passionate about, Biden stands to better represent your interest. To change my view, I would need some competing understanding of electoral politics or the candidates that could produce a calculus to how not voting for Biden could lead to a preferable outcome from a left leaning perspective. To clarify, I am talking about the general election and not a primary. Frankly you can go ham in the primary, godspeed.      u/baroquespoon (OP) has awarded 5 delta(s) in this post. All comments that earned deltas (from OP or other users) are listed here, in r/DeltaLog. Please note that a change of view doesn't necessarily mean a reversal, or that the conversation has ended. Delta System Explained | Deltaboards So the issue here is the 3 positions you list at the end of your post. ""Accelerationism"" or parties being ""tge same"" is a popular strawman coming from a position of ignorance. The point, which can be discussed at length, is that centrists like Biden and their failures directly lead to far-right popularity. This phenomenon has been studied exhaustively. Now if you're talking exclusively voting strategy, the left does not subscribe to your theory of change. The left fundamentally wants to end the current system before the current system inevitably leads to catastrophe and understands that voting, or acting within the system, cannot work to that end. The left believes, and I think with good authority, that a figure like Trump is an inevitable product of the political and economic system as currently practiced and voting for a Biden does nothing to really solve that problem. You need to actually think this logic through more. So a person's character and actual decisions don't matter? Just as long as he's more left leaning than the other guy. Think about what this would mean for a conservative. Everytime you highlight something bad about Trump's personal life, or decision he's made that goes against the grain amongst conservatives, broken promises etc... that is all basically bullshit in your eyes. The only thing that matters is he's more right leaning than the other guy. Question: when we're talking about ""bad political calculus"" here, why is this framing explicitly around blaming voters for things they can't control? Maybe you consider this outside the scope of your view, but I don't really see the difference in spirit. You have a group of people saying, ""I don't want to vote for someone who does xyz,"" and the response is to berate them. Not to actually stop doing xyz. Not to run a candidate that isn't doing xyz. Just to continually tell them that they are evil and wrong If we expand this outside of ""the left,"" Biden's polling numbers are fucking awful with pretty much everyone except for anti-Trump republicans, who aren't going to vote for him anyway. We are a year out from the vote. Biden is, statistically, the worst person in the party (next to his VP), to run against Trump if you wan to win. Again, this is without ""the left."" Which continues to beg the question: who is the one making the ""bad political calculus"" here, really? ""The left"" generally believes that in a democracy, government power is derived from, and beholden to, the people. The idea that everyone has to just keep voting blue no matter what or who is antithetical to that idea I'm a right-wing person who will not vote for Trump. Is that bad political calculus? He's not yet the official nominee. If for some reason the nominee was someone else, that it would make sense to not vote for Biden. So the issue first, then the calculus. Biden is currently firmly in support of funding Israel and is in no way at all opposed to what the IDF is currently doing.
While I don't think Trump would have any more sympathy for Palestinians, I don't think he has any less sympathy either, once you hit the 'I literally don't care if you all die' point, you can't go lower.
Trump I also genuinely believe is actually less inclined to war with Iran or other countries than Biden would be.
Trump also personally hates Bibi Netanyahu. So if you're single issue voting, I would vote for Trump on that one issue. Now on the calculus itself, It's extremely clear what the democrats have been trying to do, They are essentially saying Option B is soooo bad that you MUST vote for Option A, and we REFUSE to negotiate or change any policies or anything on the Option A side. I think a valid response to that is to at the very least refuse to agree to vote for A. Make them do something, make them make some concession, make your vote conditional on changing policies to be something you want. The Democrats best case scenario right now would be for Biden to drop out entirely, refusing to vote for him would help accomplish that and you might get someone who could both beat Trump and have actual left leaning policies. In the longer term too though, if Biden does end up losing to Trump, you at least set the stage for the future.
When Clinton lost, they didn't learn any lessons, they blamed Bernie and Russians and Sexism all this stuff. With Biden there's gonna be no excuse, He will lose because he offered Nothing to anyone and was basically a Republican-lite. So then after the Trump Dictatorship ends upon his death in 2031 the dems might decide to stop trying to run Corporate Democrats in the next election.  To clarify, I have no issue with people threatening to not vote, as I think there is political calculus there. What I take issue with is the act of not voting itself, which is what I assume many people will happily follow through on. I want to understand their calculus at that juncture, not the threat beforehand. What is a threat that is not followed up on? Why would a left leaning person need to feel compelled to vote for a right wing candidate like Biden? I know Americans think that the Democrats are left wing but they're equivalent to European Christian democratic parties in policy. Biden's term has proven that he hasn't done anything significantly different to Trump. Children are still in cages, healthcare is still a luxury few can easily afford, they didn't codify Roe Vs Wade during the first two years where they had a majority in both Houses, they've increased the funding and arming of Israel and Saudi Arabia... need I go on? Unless the Democrats are forced to earn the votes of the Left, and those who feel there is no point to vote, then the cycle will continue. The lesser evil is not lesser if the only objective difference is rhetoric.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1858lk8/cmv_not_voting_for_biden_in_2024_as_a_left/,
,"A robocall impersonating Joe Biden telling voters to stay home is the dawn of a devastating new era for phone spam: 'We knew this day would happen, and now it's here'","Over the weekend, some Democrats received calls telling them to skip the New Hampshire primary. The voice on the call was a deep fake recording of President Joe Biden. As AI becomes cheaper and stronger, experts say we've entered a dangerous new era for spam calls. After New Hampshire voters received robocalls using a deep faked voice of President Joe Biden telling them to skip the state's upcoming primary election, robocall fraud experts warned Business Insider the incident is ""just the tip of the iceberg"" and expect more to come.

""I would say no question in my mind, this will be the roughest presidential year that we've ever seen as far as robocalls and activity like this,"" Nelson added. This year in particular, Nelson said, will be bad for robocalls not just because it's an election year, but also because the scammers are gaining access to more advanced technology.

For the latest updates, results and coverage, visit CNBC’s latest live blog. Election Day has now carried over into Wednesday morning with no clear winner emerging yet in a tight contest. With polls now closed, President Donald Trump is projected to win Ohio, Florida and Texas, while former Vice President Joe Biden is ahead in Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin. The races in Georgia and North Carolina are too close to call as Trump holds slight leads. Attention is now turning to the industrial Midwest, but final results may not come for Michigan and Wisconsin until later Wednesday morning. Pennsylvania may not be called until later in the week. Biden, in an address to supporters in Delaware, urged patience as votes are counted and expressed confidence that he would ultimately prevail. As of 4:46 a.m. ET, Biden has picked up 224 electoral votes vs. 213 for Trump, according to NBC News projections. Despite Biden’s narrow lead, Trump tried to claim victory in an address to supporters, but millions of legally cast ballots are still being counted. NBC News has not made a call in the race. Republicans and Democrats are also battling for control of the Senate. Democrats flipped a seat in Colorado with John Hickenlooper’s victory over GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, while Republicans picked up a seat in Alabama with former college football coach Tommy Tuberville’s defeat of Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. The House of Representatives is projected by NBC News to remain under Democratic control. Here’s when states will start counting ballots. Here’s what you need to know so far: New Jersey, Montana, South Dakota and Arizona voters authorized the legalization of marijuana for recreational use, according to NBC News. South Dakota voters also moved to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. — Noah Higgins-Dunn Nevada said its next election result update wouldn’t come until 9 a.m. local time on Thursday. The elections division of Nevada’s secretary of state office shared on Twitter the breakdown of votes that have been counted so far and those that still need to be added to the tally. So far, Nevada has counted all in-person early votes, in-person Election Day votes and mail ballots through Nov. 2, the account tweeted. But mail ballots received on Election Day or over the next week will still need to be counted, as well as provisional ballots. It’s hard to estimate how many ballots are still outstanding, according to the officials, since the state sent mail ballots to every voter, though it doesn’t expect all of those ballots to be cast. Biden held a narrow lead as of Wednesday morning. — Lauren Feiner Biden leads in the Electoral College as of 5:35 a.m. ET Wednesday though votes in several close races are still being counted. Both candidates still need to gain several more states to reach an Electoral College majority of at least 270. —Lauren Feiner Democratic nominee Joe Biden has pulled ahead of President Donald Trump in the crucial swing state of Wisconsin, according to NBC News’ latest tally of votes. With 89% of the expected vote in, Biden has 1,575,490 votes, or 49.3%, compared to Trump’s 1,564,877 votes, or 49%. — Kevin Stankiewicz Joe Biden is projected to win Hawaii’s four electoral votes, according to NBC News. The Aloha State, which is the birthplace of former President Barack Obama, was widely expected to break for Biden over President Donald Trump. At the time that Hawaii was projected to fall in Biden’s column, the former vice president had amassed 224 electoral votes, compared with Trump’s 213. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump on Wednesday declared that he would “be going to the U.S. Supreme Court” as part of a fight over the outcome of the presidential election, saying “we want all voting to stop.”  “We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list,” Trump said from the White House. However, there are two issues with the president’s statements. First, Trump’s comments came more than an hour after the final U.S. polls closed in Alaska, so voting has indeed stopped, and there is no evidence that ballots are still being cast after the legal deadline. Rather, elections officials in states are counting and processing millions of legally cast votes. Secondly, it was not immediately clear what Trump meant by “going to the Supreme Court.” That is because the country’s high court typically reviews decisions made by lower courts. For example, in the 2000 election, there were numerous rulings made by lower courts over the Florida recount effort that were ultimately appealed up to the Supreme Court. Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign manager criticized Trump’s comments, but vowed to be ready to counter any legal action. “If the president makes good on his threat to go to court to try to prevent the proper tabulation of votes, we have legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort. And they will prevail,” Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a written statement Wednesday morning. — Kevin Stankiewicz, Christina Wilkie Joe Biden’s campaign manager said in a statement Wednesday morning that President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the counting of votes should stop was was “outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect.” “It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” Jen O’Malley Dillon said in the written statement. “The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted. Because that is what our laws — the laws that protect every Americans’ constitutional right to vote — require,” she added. Trump’s comments from the White House earlier Wednesday, in which he also falsely said he won the presidential election, came as millions of legally cast ballots have yet to be counted in the U.S. Elections. Officials in states across the country have warned that tallying the official vote this year could take longer than normal due in part to a surge of mail-in ballots this year. — Kevin Stankiewicz As of this moment in the race, Joe Biden has clinched 220 electoral votes, while President Donald Trump has secured 213 votes, according to NBC News projections. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House. NBC has yet to make calls in more than a half-dozen crucial states, and thousands of votes — including rafts of mail-in votes in some states and counties — have yet to be tallied up. Both candidates can envision various pathways to 270 votes, based on the states that have yet to be won. Trump, for example, could hit that target by scoring wins in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada. Biden is also hoping to win Pennsylvania — but pathways to the White House are still available to him if he loses the Keystone State and even Wisconsin. The former vice president could, for instance, win if he carries Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan — assuming he wins at least one vote from Maine, which is considered highly likely. Here are the states that are still too early, or too close, for NBC to call: — Kevin Breuninger Facebook
began alerting users early Wednesday that ballots are still being counted, after President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he had won the presidential election, even though millions of votes had yet to be counted. “Once President Trump began making premature claims of victory, we started running notifications on Facebook and Instagram that votes are still being counted and a winner is not projected,” Facebook said in a tweet. “We’re also automatically applying labels to both candidates’ posts with this information.”, NBC News has not yet projected the presidential election results.  The company in September announced that it would add a label to any post from a candidate or campaign that tries to declare victory before the final results are in. -- Jessica Bursztynsky Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County is suspending scanning mail-in ballots until 10 a.m. ET Wednesday, NBC News reported. Allegheny County spokesperson Amie Downs said in a statement that staff has been asked to report in at 10 a.m. to begin scanning “shortly after.” About half of the 348,485 mail-in and absentee ballots that have been returned have already been scanned and uploaded, according to Downs. Roughly 29,000 will be manually reviewed through the Return Board process. The remaining 146,537 will be scanned starting late morning Wednesday, according to Downs. All ballots are being stored in a warehouse with county police on patrol as well as 24-hour video surveillance, Downs said. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump addressed supporters early Wednesday from the White House and tried to claim victory in the presidential election, even as states across the U.S. continue to count millions of legally cast ballots. NBC News also has not made a call in the race. Trump described the continued tallying of votes, which has caused his advantage in states such as Georgia to dwindle, as “an embarrassment to our country.” However, it has widely been expected that it could take days for official election results, including in states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, due in part to the surge in mail-in voting this year. In his address, Trump also touted his performance in Texas, Ohio and Florida, which NBC News projects the president will win over Democratic nominee Joe Biden. — Kevin Stankiewicz Several key races in the fight for Senate control were unresolved early Wednesday. NBC News projects Republicans will hold at least 47 seats after the 2020 election. Democrats will have at least 46, including two independents who caucus with the party. Seven races were still undecided. They include the Arizona special election, which was too early to call as Democrat Mark Kelly led Republican Sen. Martha McSally. Elections in North Carolina and Georgia, where GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and David Perdue, respectively, defend their seats, were too close to call. Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ reelection bid in Maine was too early to call. At least the GOP-controlled seat in Colorado and Democratic-held seat in Alabama are projected to flip. Republicans currently have a 53-47 majority in the Senate. — Jacob Pramuk With Joe Biden’s wins in Minnesota and Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, the Democratic presidential candidate picks up 11 electoral votes, NBC News projects. Biden has now secured 220 electoral votes while President Donald Trump has 213, according to NBC News projections as of 1:45 a.m. ET. —Hannah Miao Twitter
 has appended a warning over a tweet from President Donald Trump claiming that the opposition is trying to steal the election. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” the president’s tweet reads. Twitter attached a label over the tweet, reading “Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.” Facebook also flagged both posts on its platform, with separate messages on each. — Megan Graham Former Vice President Joe Biden will win Nebraska’s second congressional district, NBC News projects, flipping blue one electoral vote that President Donald Trump won in 2016. Nebraska and Maine are the only states that don’t play by the winner-take-all rules under the Electoral College. Instead, both have adopted laws that distribute their electoral votes in part by the statewide popular vote winner and in part by who gets more votes in each of their congressional districts. Nebraska has five electoral votes — four of which were projected by NBC to go to Trump. — Kevin Breuninger Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is projected to win Minnesota, according to NBC News. Minnesota is worth 10 electoral votes. The state has chosen Democratic presidential candidates for the last 11 elections. However, Trump only trailed Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by 1.5% in 2016. — Todd Haselton and Hannah Miao One of the last competitive Senate races on the 2020 election map may take a while to resolve. The Maine contest pitting Republican Sen. Susan Collins against Democratic state House Speaker Sara Gideon was too early to call early Wednesday, according to NBC News. Gideon’s campaign suggested it could take days to declare a winner. “It’s clear this race will not be called tonight and we are prepared to see it through to the finish,” campaign manager Amy Mesner said. “Over the coming days, we will make sure that every Mainer has their voice heard in this election.“

Collins projected confidence to her supporters on Tuesday night, saying that “with any luck at all, we’ll keep on going for Maine and for America.” If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, the state’s ranked-choice voting system would kick in. If that happens, it could take days to decide the winner. — Jacob Pramuk President Donald Trump is projected to win Montana and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win Rhode Island, according to NBC News. Montana is worth three Electoral College votes and was expected to go to Trump, who won the state in 2016. Rhode Island is worth four electoral votes for Biden. —Todd Haselton President Donald Trump will win Texas, pocketing its haul of 38 electoral votes, according to NBC News projections. With more than 90% of the vote in, Trump led Democrat Joe Biden by about 6 percentage points, according to NBC News. Texas has long been a Republican stronghold, but some public opinion polls before the election showed a close race between Biden and Trump. The president won Texas by 9 points in 2016. Capturing its large batch of electoral votes this year is key for him to win a second term. — Kevin Stankiewicz With President Donald Trump’s projected win in Iowa, electoral vote shares currently stand at 205 votes for Democratic challenger Joe Biden and 171 for the president, according to NBC News projections. The electoral vote update as of 12:55 a.m. ET is still missing projections from key races, with final results for states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania not expected potentially for days after election night. —Hannah Miao Joe Biden told supporters early Wednesday he was “confident” he would capture Arizona and its 11 electoral votes, a state that President Donald Trump won in 2016. “We’re still in the game in Georgia, although that’s not one we expected, and we’re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan,” Biden added during his post-midnight address in Wilmington, Delaware. The races in Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan are still too early to call, according to NBC News. — Kevin Stankiewicz President Donald Trump is projected to win Iowa, according to NBC News. The state is worth six Electoral College votes. Trump won the election in Iowa in 2016 with 51.2% of the vote. Republican Sen. Joni Ernst will win Iowa’s Senate race, NBC News projected. The first-term senator faced a serious challenge from Democrat Theresa Greenfield, who had never held elected office.  — Todd Haselton and Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump sounded off on Twitter as Democrat Joe Biden took the stage to express his optimism about the presidential contest. Trump, in a series of tweets, claimed his campaign was up “BIG,” even as many ballots in key states were still being counted. He also announced that he would make a statement, presumably in person, sometime “tonight.” Trump corrected one of the tweets, which initially misspelled “polls.” Twitter quickly flagged that tweet with a warning label, which said Trump’s post “might be misleading about” the election. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” the tweet said. Earlier, Trump’s tweet spelled polls “Poles.” — Kevin Breuninger Democratic nominee Joe Biden said early Wednesday morning that he was confident he would defeat President Donald Trump in the presidential election, but urged patience as votes were counted across key Rust Belt states, Arizona and Georgia. “Look, we feel good about where we are. We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election,” Biden said as he spoke to supporters in Wilmington, Delaware. “We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, it was going to take a while. We’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished.” — Kevin Stankiewicz President Donald Trump is projected to win battleground Florida’s 29 electoral votes, according to NBC News. The president won Florida by 1.2% in 2016. —Hannah Miao President Donald Trump is projected to win Idaho, according to NBC News. The state is worth four electoral votes.

Hillary Clinton won Virginia in 2016. NBC projects Democrat Sen. Mark Warner will win reelection. — Todd Haselton An official call on the presidential race looks unlikely to come on election night as three critical states continue to tally their votes. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which hold a combined 46 electoral votes, have been a target for Democrats to win after President Donald Trump narrowly carried the states in 2016. They carry almost a fifth of the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the presidency. Many had expected Pennsylvania’s tally to come later than election night since officials are not allowed to open mailed ballots until Election Day. Officials in Michigan and Wisconsin warned that votes could continue to be tallied until early Wednesday morning or even that night. —Lauren Feiner Polls in Hawaii closed at midnight ET. The state, which Democrats have carried for nearly three decades, has four electoral votes. It’s the second-to-last poll to close, followed by Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump will win Ohio and its 18 electoral votes, according to projections from NBC News. With almost 90% of Ohio’s vote in, Trump leads Democratic nominee Joe Biden by about 8%, according to NBC News. Trump also carried the state in 2016 by 8% en route to his upset victory. The closely watched swing state has increasingly trended toward Republicans in recent years. -- Kevin Stankiewicz Both campaigns have turned their attention to the Midwest as President Donald Trump neared victory in Florida and North Carolina. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa are all still too close to call. Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin may take days to count mail-in votes, making it unlikely a winner would be named on election night.

Michigan needs a full day before it reports its count, according to MSNBC. Seven of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties won’t count mail-in ballots until Wednesday, according to local officials. Philadelphia stopped counting mail-in ballots and will resume Wednesday. — Alex Sherman The U.S. dollar strengthened against China’s currency around 10:30 p.m. ET, with foreign exchange markets demanding more yuan for every greenback. The U.S. dollar hit a high of 6.7741 against the Chinese yuan, reaching its highest level since Oct. 2, when the dollar traded as high as 6.7776 against the yuan. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan is important given the large volume of trade between the two nations. The dollar had been falling versus the yuan in anticipation of a Biden win, traders said. — Thomas Franck Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham will hold onto his South Carolina U.S. Senate seat after a tough challenge from Democrat Jaime Harrison,, NBC News projected. Harrison, whose campaign focused in part on Graham’s loyalty to President Donald Trump raised a whopping $57 million in the third quarter, outpacing the incumbent senator. As Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Graham had pushed forward Trump’s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans voted to confirm Barrett late last month as voters across the country had already begun to cast early ballots in the 2020 election. In 2016, Graham opposed confirming then-President Barack Obama’s high court nominee, citing the election year, but this time he argued that the alignment of the president’s party and the GOP’s control of the Senate made the circumstances unique. —Lauren Feiner President Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Wyoming and Mississippi, according to NBC News. Wyoming has three electoral votes, while Mississippi has six. Trump won both states in 2016 and was widely expected to carry them again this year. Republican Cynthia Lummis also will win the U.S. Senate race in Wyoming, according to NBC News projections. She previously represented the state in the House of Representatives. —Kevin Stankiewicz President Trump is projected to win three of the five electoral votes in Nebraska, according to NBC News.

With these three projected wins, Biden picks up 76 electoral votes. —Hannah Miao The mood is “great” in the White House’s East Room, where a couple of hundred people gathered to watch election results, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC’s Kayla Tausche. The gathering comes less than two months after the White House hosted guests at an event announcing Amy Coney Barrett as the Supreme Court nominee, which the nation’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci later labeled a “super-spreader event.” President Donald Trump and several other White House officials fell ill with the virus shortly after the event. —Lauren Feiner The following states will close their polls for the night at 11 p.m. ET. — Carmen Reinicke Democratic candidate Joe Biden is projected to win Illinois, according to NBC News.

The state is worth six electoral votes. — Todd Haselton Democrats will keep their House majority, NBC News projects. While Democratic control of the House is confirmed, the party is looking to expand its majority in the chamber. Currently, Democrats hold 232 House seats. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans vie for control of the Senate. The GOP picked up a seat with Tommy Tuberville’s projected win in Alabama, while Democrats picked up a seat with John Hickenlooper’s projected win in Colorado, according to NBC News projections. —Hannah Miao Republican Tommy Tuberville is projected to win the Alabama U.S. Senate race against incumbent Democrat Doug Jones, according to NBC News. Jones won the seat narrowly in the 2017 special election. Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach, was well known in Alabama and aligned himself closely with President Donald Trump. The GOP picked up a Senate seat with Tuberville’s projected win. Earlier, NBC News projected Democrat John Hickenlooper flipped the Republican-held Colorado Senate seat. —Hannah Miao President Donald Trump is projected to win Louisiana and Kansas, according to NBC News. Louisiana is worth eight electoral votes and Kansas is worth six electoral votes. — Todd Haselton President Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in Ohio, but the race is too early to call, according to NBC News.

President Donald Trump won Iowa, Montana and Utah in 2016. —Hannah Miao Colorado Senate nominee John Hickenlooper will defeat Republican incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner, NBC News projected, flipping the seat to Democratic control. Democrats need to gain four seats in the Senate to take control of the chamber. The victory of Hickenlooper, the former two-term governor, brings them one step closer to that goal. Gardner’s reelection bid had long been considered an uphill battle. Colorado has widely backed Democratic candidates in statewide races, including Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid for the White House and Michael Bennet’s Senate race that year. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race in South Carolina, according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia’s junior senator, is also projected to defeat her Democratic rival, according to NBC. Neither result was unexpected. Trump beat then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race by more than 40 percentage points in West Virginia, exit polls showed. Now, as in 2016, he is projected to walk away with the state’s five electoral votes. Capito was widely favored to defeat Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin. — Kevin Breuninger Arkansas is the only state closing polls for the night at 8:30 p.m. ET. The state has six electoral votes. — Jessica Dickler Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win Connecticut, according to the NBC News Decision desk.

Polls in Tennessee closed at 8 p.m. ET. — Carmen Reinicke Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will win reelection in Kentucky, NBC News projected. The Republican will defeat Democratic former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath. While McGrath drew gobs of money as she took on the top Senate Republican, polls consistently showed her trailing McConnell in the red state. It only remains to be seen whether McConnell will lead a GOP in the Senate majority or minority in January. While he has distanced himself from Trump in some areas — particularly on both the White House’s handling of its coronavirus outbreak and on the size of a potential stimulus package — McConnell has found common ground with Trump on numerous critical issues. Most recently, he moved swiftly to confirm Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett before the election. — Jacob Pramuk The presidential race in Florida is too close to call and in Pennsylvania it’s too early, according to NBC News. Both states are key for both President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden as they battle it out for the White House on election night. The polls going into Election Day showed both candidates basically tied in those states. Florida and Pennsylvania combined are worth 49 Electoral College votes. — Brian Schwartz President Donald Trump is projected to win Kentucky’s eight electoral votes, according to NBC News. Polls showed Kentucky, the home of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was heavily favored for Trump over Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The Bluegrass State has voted for the GOP’s presidential candidate in every race since 2000. In the 2016 election, Trump won more than 62% of Kentucky’s electorate over Hillary Clinton. — Kevin Breuninger President Donald Trump is projected to win the presidential race in Oklahoma, NBC News projects. Trump won the state’s seven electoral votes in 2016 as well, with 65% of the vote. Polls closed at 8 p.m. ET.
— Jessica Dickler The Senate races in Maine and Alabama, two of the most important in the fight for control of the chamber, are too early to call, according to NBC News. Polls showed the two states were among the most likely to flip party control entering Election Day. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is trying to defend her seat against Democratic state House Speaker Sara Gideon. Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Doug Jones aims to hold off former college football coach Tommy Tuberville in Alabama, a red state. Republicans hope to hold their 53-47 majority in the Senate. — Jacob Pramuk Democratic nominee Joe Biden is projected to win electoral votes in Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey, according to the NBC News Decision Desk.

While no ballots or machinery were damaged, the incident delayed officials’ ballot counting by about four hours, according to Fulton County spokesperson Regina Walker. Fulton County includes metro Atlanta and is the most populous county in Georgia. Walker told NBC News that county officials are pushing to complete vote tallies Tuesday night, though she did not give an estimated completion time. Georgia is considered a battleground state in 2020 with competitive presidential, Senate and House races. The incident was first reported by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. —Hannah Miao The next round of states are closing their polls at 8 p.m. ET. -- Jessica Bursztynsky Senate races in Georgia and South Carolina remain too close to call, according to NBC News projections. Both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats are up for grabs in 2020. Republican Sen. David Perdue faces Democrat Jon Ossoff. Top candidates for the other open Georgia U.S. Senate seat are Republican Sen. Kelley Loeffler, Democrat Matt Lieberman, Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Doug Collins. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in either race, the top two finishers will compete in a critical January runoff election. In South Carolina, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison are competing for a Senate seat. These races could help help determine the majority party of the U.S. Senate following the 2020 election. Polls closed at 7 p.m. ET in both states. —Hannah Miao The presidential contests in the battleground states of North Carolina and Ohio are too close to project a winner, according to NBC News. In North Carolina, 15 Electoral College votes are at stake in the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Most of the more than 2,500 precinct polling places in the Tar Heel State were set to close at 7:30 p.m. ET, but four were granted deadline extensions of up to 45 minutes because of delays in opening Tuesday morning. Ohio has 18 electoral votes at stake. Polls were set to close at 7:30 p.m. ET in the Buckeye State. - Dan Mangan The Senate race in North Carolina is too early to call, according to NBC News. The election pits Republican Sen. Thom Tillis against Democratic former state Sen. Cal Cunningham. Polls entering Election Day showed a neck-and-neck contest for the seat. The race will play a major role in determining whether Republicans keep their 53-47 Senate majority. — Jacob Pramuk Former Vice President Joe Biden will win the presidential contest in Vermont, Sen. Bernie Sanders’ home state, NBC News projects. Biden was heavily favored to win the deep-blue Northeastern state’s three electoral votes. Vermont has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every race since 1992. Sanders, an independent and self-described democratic socialist, has served in the Senate since 2007. He ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primaries but became a surrogate for the nominee. — Kevin Breuninger The next round of states will close their polls at 7:30 p.m. ET. -- Jessica Bursztynsky President Donald Trump will win the presidential vote in Indiana, Vice President Mike Pence’s home state, NBC News projects. Polls entering Election Day showed the Republican incumbent heavily favored to carry the state. Trump will win Indiana’s 11 electoral votes, as he did in 2016. Pence was Indiana governor from 2013 to 2017 and a member of Indiana’s congressional delegation from 2001 to 2013. Federal election watchers will also keep an eye on the state’s 5th Congressional District, a suburban seat Republicans are trying to defend. — Jacob Pramuk The first round of states are about to close their polls for the night at 7 p.m. ET. — Jessica Bursztynsky Facebook
is notifying U.S. users they can still vote if they are already in line after polls close Tuesday. The company will show these notifications at the top of users’ Facebook and Instagram apps, a spokesman for the social media company said. The notifications will be shown to people of voting age as polls start to close in their states, and they’ll be shown nationwide on Instagram starting at 7 p.m. ET. The notifications will also direct users to election updates from the company’s voter information center, where they can get accurate election information. — Salvador Rodriguez A slim majority of voters nationwide want the Supreme Court to keep the Affordable Care Act as it is, according to NBC News exit polls. Fifty-three percent of voters would keep the 2010 health-care law as it is, and 42% percent would overturn it, according to a poll of early and Election Day voters. Low-income voters show the strongest support for Obamacare, according to the NBC poll. Sixty-one percent of voters with family income under $50,000 would keep the Affordable Care Act the same, compared with 44% of voters with family incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 and 55% with incomes over $100,000. Health-care policy was cited by voters as one of the most important issues in the 2018 midterm election but has been overtaken in the presidential election by the economy, coronavirus pandemic and racial injustice, according to NBC. About 11% of voters said health-care policy was the most important issue in deciding their vote. — Carmen Reinicke Votes in Georgia will be tallied by noon Wednesday “at the very latest,” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told NBC News. Record early voting turnout will help the state count votes “faster than many other states,” Raffensperger said. Votes could be tallied as soon as Tuesday night, he added. As of Tuesday afternoon, Raffensperger’s office said lines to vote averaged just a two minute wait. Georgia awarded its 16 electoral votes to President Donald Trump in 2016 but is considered a close race this election. — Lauren Feiner U.S. stock futures rose about 10 minutes after the start of the extended trading as select polls in Kentucky and Indiana closed, marking the beginning of an overnight session expected to twist and turn depending on the election results. Dow futures were last seen up 150 points after at first opening little changed. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.5% and 0.35%, respectively. The positive move in futures came after stocks clinched yet another strong day of gains during Tuesday’s regular session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
 closed 554.98 points higher, or up 2.1%, at 27,480.03. Cyclical industrial and financials were the best-performing sectors in the S&P 500, gaining more than 2% each. The S&P 500

Forty-two percent of respondents said rebuilding the economy was the most important issue, even if it hurt efforts to contain the virus. The exit polls also outlined the most important issues for voters as they decided to cast their ballots. About a third of voters said the economy was the most important issue; 21% said racial injustice was the most important issue, while 18% said it was the Covid-19 outbreak. — Jessica Bursztynsky Democrat Joe Biden took a step back Tuesday afternoon to reflect on the presidential campaign that’s coming to an end. Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, after a full day of campaign stops in Pennsylvania, Biden said he had no regrets for how he ran the race. He also said he was superstitious about making predictions on Election Day. “I think we’re going to reestablish that blue wall” in the Midwest, he said. The former vice president also marveled at the expanded electoral map this year for Democrats, who are competitive across the Sun Belt for the first time in decades. “You can’t think of an election in the recent past where so many states were up for grabs,” Biden said. “The idea I’m in play in Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida? I mean, come on. Texas??” Biden was likewise sanguine about President Donald Trump, who reportedly may try to claim victory on Tuesday night before the votes are counted. Biden is scheduled to speak in Wilmington. “If there’s something to talk about tonight, I’ll talk about it,” he said. “If not I’ll wait till the votes are counted the next day.” — Christina Wilkie A federal judge ordered U.S. Postal Service inspectors to sweep mail processing facilities in 12 postal districts nationwide on Tuesday afternoon for ballots to ensure that they are delivered by voting deadlines. The order came on the heels of a new court filing by the Postal Service that showed the fifth consecutive day of fewer on-time ballot deliveries. The Postal Service said its processing score fell from roughly 91% to a new low on Monday of 89.59%, and the districts affected by the order have particularly low deliver ratings. The order, by Judge Emmet Sullivan in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., directed that Postal Service inspectors begin their sweeps no later than 12:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and to continue looking through 3 p.m. ET. The facilities subject to the order are central Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; Detroit; Colorado/Wyoming; Atlanta; Houston; Alabama; northern New England; greater South Carolina; South Florida; Lakeland, Florida; and Arizona. Sullivan also ordered that the Postal Service, by no later than 4:30 p.m. ET, “shall file a status update certifying compliance with this paragraph upon confirming, in the most efficient manner available, that sweeps were conducted and that no ballots were left behind.” Postal Service data reveals that around 300,000 ballots nationwide have been scanned after being accepted into the mail system without later scans showing their delivery. — Dan Mangan More than 100 million voters cast their ballots early in the 2020 election, according to data from the NBC News Decision Desk and TargetSmart, an analytics firm. That total more than doubles the number of early and absentee ballots cast in 2016 — about 46 million. The historic number was fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats were more likely to vote early or absentee, according to the data, though Republicans are counting on their voters to show up in larger numbers on Election Day. About 43% of early or absentee votes were cast by Democrats and about 37% were cast by Republicans. Women also cast more ballots early than men did. Women cast about 53% of early ballots and men cast about 44%, while the data does not include gender for the remaining voters. -- Tucker Higgins President Donald Trump is back at the White House and is scheduled to remain there through Election Day. The president will be briefed on the race throughout the day at the White House, a person close to the Trump campaign told NBC News. As election returns roll in Tuesday night, Trump will be in the Oval Office with family and top aides to monitor the results, NBC reported. A “war room” has also been set up in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, located next to the White House, according to NBC. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh told NBC that the war room setup “needed to be in close proximity to the president and there is no expense whatsoever to American taxpayers for the use of a room in the EEOB, where events like prayer services and receptions for outside groups frequently occur.” “Every piece of equipment, including Wi-Fi and computers, was paid for by the campaign, and no White House staff is involved. The arrangement has been approved by White House counsel,” Murtaugh added. Multiple outlets reported that an election night party with hundreds of guests will be held in the East Room of the White House. Guests will be required to be tested for the coronavirus, according to NBC. — Kevin Breuninger The reporting of presidential election results from North Carolina will be delayed by at least 45 minutes due to voting deadline extensions being granted to four precincts that were unable to open on time Tuesday morning. One of them, the Plainview fire station in the town of Dunn in Sampson County, had its deadline extended to 8:15 p.m. — 45 minutes past the state’s Election Day deadline of 7:30 p.m. North Carolina does not report its voting tallies until all polling precincts are closed. North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. The state has 15 Electoral College votes at stake. Polls in in the state normally are open from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. ET. Precincts can have closing times extended if their openings are delayed by more than 15 minutes. The law allows an extension up to equal to the amount of time delayed. The state elections board voted at an emergency meeting to extend the closing times at two locations in Sampson County, one in Cabarrus County and one in Guilford County after hearing about computer issues and problems with printers that contributed to opening delays. In addition to the Plainview fire station precinct, other locations were extended by the amount of their delays, which ranged from 17 to the 34 minutes. People who vote after 7:30 p.m. at the four precincts will cast provisional ballots, officials said. – Dan Mangan and Hannah Miao Correction: This post has been updated to reflect the accurate revised closing time of the Plainview fire station precinct in Sampson County. President Trump expressed confidence in what he and his team are seeing so far in key states but signaled that the prospect of a Biden victory is on his mind. “Winning is easy. Losing is never easy. Not for me it’s not,” Trump told reporters at a Republican National Committee office in Arlington, Virginia. Most of the RNC staffers in view of the camera wore masks, while Trump and some of his officials in tow, including chief of staff Mark Meadows and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, did not. Trump, when asked, said he had not yet written either an acceptance speech or a concession speech. “I’m not thinking about concession speech or acceptance speech yet. Hopefully we’ll be only doing one of those two,” he said. The president touted the slew of large, in-person rallies he held in the days before the election, saying that his final push and his performance in the last debate against Joe Biden boosted his campaign. Asked how he was feeling, Trump acknowledged his voice was “a bit choppy” following the swing-state sweep. “God did not design it for that much,” he said. “We had some incredible rallies and incredible times, and I hear we’re doing very well in Florida and we’re doing very well in Arizona and incredible in Texas,” he said. “I’m looking at different locations and we’re seeing lines of people,” he added, “and they’re wearing a lot of red material, including hats.”
— Kevin Breuninger The New York City Police Department “is ready” to respond to potential demonstrations after the election and has advised local businesses to secure items outside their storefronts as a precaution, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We are not seeing any major demonstrations being planned at this moment,” de Blasio told New York City radio station 1010 Wins, encouraging people to demonstrate peacefully if they have concerns. “I think it will play out more as we see results, but the city’s ready, the NYPD is ready, and the most important thing here is that people need to participate in this election and then, obviously, respect the will of the people,” he said. Some New York City businesses in recent days have boarded up their storefront windows in case of post-election disorder, though de Blasio said the city didn’t advise them to do so. — Noah Higgins-Dunn First lady Melania Trump cast her ballot on Tuesday in Palm Beach, Fla., where photos and video showed that she was the only person in her polling station who was not wearing a mask. The first lady entered the Morton and Barbara Mandel Recreation Center at around 10 a.m., and waved and smiled to reporters. Trump contracted Covid-19 last month along with President Donald Trump and their son Barron, and since then she has remained largely out of the public eye in the White House. On Tuesday, the first lady said she was feeling “great.” Trump’s appearance in a public space without a mask is all but certain to draw criticism from public health experts, especially as the nation experiences a record surge in coronavirus cases. The president has repeatedly dismissed the importance of wearing masks, despite an overwhelming consensus among scientists that they prevent the spread of coronavirus. — Christina Wilkie WASHINGTON — The acting Department of Homeland Security secretary said Tuesday there was no indication that a “foreign actor” had compromised U.S. votes as the nation enters its final day in the 2020 presidential race. “We have no indications that a foreign actor has succeeded in compromising or manipulating any votes in this election,” Chad Wolf told reporters, adding that the results from the election may take a few days. “It is important to recognize this process may require time,” Wolf said referencing the Covid-19 pandemic and the influx of mail-in votes. Alongside Wolf, DHS official Christopher Krebs said that while he had seen some indications of disruption, the U.S. election systems proved to be resilient. Top U.S. government officials, as well as leaders of the intelligence community, have previously flagged attempts by Russia, China, and Iran to influence the U.S. election. — Amanda Macias President Donald Trump departed the White House for a visit to the Republican National Committee Annex in Arlington, Virginia, more than an hour after he was scheduled to roll out. Trump was originally set to exit the White House at 9:45 a.m., but on Tuesday morning that departure time was updated to 11 a.m. The president was not seen walking out of the White House residence until 12:03 p.m., according to the White House press pool. The White House declined CNBC’s request for more information on the president’s schedule. Trump had traveled extensively on Monday, flying to four key swing states and delivering long speeches at five campaign rallies — the last of which ended after 1 a.m. Tuesday morning. On Election Day morning, Trump called into Fox News, where he said he planned to declare victory “when there’s victory, if there’s victory.” — Kevin Breuninger A dark money organization has quietly spent nearly half a million dollars on ads against President Donald Trump in the buildup to Election Day. The ad spending spree came from a group called A Healthy Future, which has spent over $400,000 on Google, YouTube and Facebook ads in at least the past 10 days. The group is taking aim at Trump’s executive order intended to lower prescription drug prices. The order was signed by the president in September. One of the ads argues that the executive order could impact the development and pricing of an eventual coronavirus vaccine. “America needs a cure for Covid-19 now and innovative biopharmaceutical companies are rising to the challenge. So why is President Trump risking American lives with dangerous executive orders?” the voiceover in the ad says. NBC News’ Decision Desk will make calls on races tonight and beyond. CNBC will bring those calls to you on the air, as well as on this blog and our homepage. For a guide on how NBC decides to call races, go here. – Mike Calia Election Day voting in five key battleground states got off to a mostly smooth start on Tuesday, according to monitors affiliated with the national nonpartisan democracy group Common Cause. State leaders for the group in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and Georgia reported that voting was proceeding with little sign of systemic problems on a briefing held around 10 a.m. ET. Suzanne Almeida, interim director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, said that despite Covid-19 it was “almost a regular Election Day in Pennsylvania thus far,” though she said that the state faced many long lines, particularly in communities of color. Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, also reported long lines but few signs of systemic trouble. “All in all, a pretty good report from North Carolina,” said Bob Phillips, the executive director of Common Cause North Carolina. “No major machine problems, no long lines, no Covid issues. All good things. A few precincts did not open on time.” Liza McClenaghan, chair of the Common Cause Florida governing board, said the group had received 500 “mostly generic” inquiries. Despite traffic issues and some trouble with electronic poll books that were programmed incorrectly in Lake County, “it’s going smoothly at the moment in Florida,” she said. Aunna Dennis, the executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said that some precincts in the state’s Fulton County did not originally receive some necessary supplies, but that more supplies were eventually sent. She said that in several precincts there were problems with the electronic voting software because of an update from the state sent Monday evening, and that the group was working to determine whether the issue was occurring statewide. “There are technology procedures in place to work with those types of issues,” she said. – Tucker Higgins The U.S. Postal Service on Election Day reported its fifth consecutive day of fewer on-time ballot deliveries, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The Postal Service said its processing score fell from roughly 91% to a new low on Monday of 89.59%. The Postal Service has been under fire since Trump-appointed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy took over the reins of the government agency in May, 2020. Before policy changes implemented on his watch, on-time delivery rates were around 95%. There are 28 states that will not accept ballots that arrive after Election Day, even if they are postmarked before Nov. 3rd. On Nov. 1, a judge ordered the agency to remind senior managers they must follow its “extraordinary measures” policy and use its Express Mail Network to expedite ballots ahead of Tuesday’s presidential election. – Valerie Block Former FBI Director James Comey is talking again, and a lot of people are not happy about it. Again. Comey, whose controversial letter to Congress about Hillary Clinton in October 2016 is widely blamed for contributing to her defeat that year, tweeted his support of current Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Tuesday. “Vote for your country,” Comey wrote in his Twitter post, which contained a photo of him raising a Biden/Harris coffee mug, while wearing a Biden/Harris 2020 t-shirt with the words “Truth,” “Hope,” and “Decency.” Comey promptly received a barrage of scathing replies from people who either still blame him for Clinton’s loss, or for what they consider a baseless “hoax” of an FBI investigation into President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and its ties to Russians. Trump’s firing of Comey as FBI director in 2017 led directly to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to continue that probe. Comey on Oct. 28, 2016, sent Congress a letter saying the FBI had learned about the existence of emails that appeared pertinent into an investigation into the use of a private email server while Clinton was secretary of State under President Barack Obama. That letter came less than two weeks before Election Day, and rocked Clinton’s campaign. Comey months earlier had infuriated Clinton supporters, as well as backers of Trump’s campaign, for a long-winded news conference about that same probe in which he said both that “no reasonable prosecutor” would lodge charges against Clinton in the case, while saying at the same time “there is evidence of potential violations of” laws about the handling of classified information. The political data news site FiveThirtyEight in 2017 said that the disclosure of Comey’s letter to Congress, “at a maximum ... might have shifted the race by 3 or 4 percentage points toward Donald Trump, swinging Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida to him, perhaps along with North Carolina and Arizona.” “At a minimum, its impact might have been only a percentage point or so. Still, because Clinton lost Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by less than 1 point, the letter was probably enough to change the outcome of the Electoral College,” the site’s founder, Nate Silver, wrote. –Dan Mangan Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden took two of his granddaughters to see his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Tuesday morning, part of a series of informal Election Day campaign stops in the battleground state. Biden said his two granddaughters, Finnegan and Natalie, had never seen his childhood home, so he wanted to show them. Outside the modest house, supporters filled the streets, chanting and cheering. While he was in the house, Biden wrote a short prayer on the wall: “From this house to the White House with the grace of God.” It was the second time he had written on the wall there, the first time was during Biden’s successful campaign as President Barack Obama’s running mate in 2008. Pool reporter Alexi McCammond tweeted photos of the prayer. ---Christina Wilkie Twenty-one states — including the key swing states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — on Monday hit record highs in the number of average daily new coronavirus cases reported, Johns Hopkins University data show. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed at least 231,566 people in the U.S., has been a defining issue in the 2020 election between President Trump and Joe Biden. But while the crisis has formed the cornerstone of Biden’s closing argument, Trump has shifted his focus elsewhere in the final days of the race. Trump has long downplayed the virus, and in a spate of lengthy campaign speeches Monday spent relatively little time discussing the pandemic, even as experts in his own administration warn that the U.S. could be on the cusp of the most dangerous period yet. Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, reportedly said in a leaked memo dated Monday that the U.S. is entering “the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic.” On Monday, Trump repeated his claim that the recent increase in cases is due to an increase in testing. Experts, including Trump administration officials, dispute that assertion. Some states, such as Ohio, where Joe Biden visited on Election Day eve, have also hit new peaks in hospitalizations. — Kevin Breuninger Democratic nominee Joe Biden stopped by a canvass kickoff event in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday morning, the first of several informal stops he plans to make throughout the day. Biden arrived at the Carpenters Local Union Hall 445 shortly after 9 a.m. ET, where about 60 supporters, including Pennsylvania’s senior Sen. Bob Casey, were waiting to welcome him. Biden noted that he scored his first unanimous victory last night – with 5 out of 5 votes cast – in tiny Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, which traditionally votes for president just after midnight on Election Day. “So based on Trump’s notion, I’m gonna declare victory right now,” Biden joked, poking fun at President Donald Trump, who reportedly may try to claim victory on Tuesday night before all the votes are counted. Biden then gave a shorter version of his stump speech, telling the crowd through a handheld megaphone that he ran for president to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the middle class and to unite the country. –Christina Wilkie With Election Day under way, millions now await the results of the all-important presidential race and the composition of the U.S. Senate. CNBC posted a schedule of when each state’s polls close and how many electoral votes each state is allotted so voters can keep track of results on Election Night. Results by state tend to trickle in in the hours immediately following poll closure. The first states to close their polls are Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, where voting concludes at 7 p.m. ET. Most of Florida’s polls close at 7 p.m., while the panhandle will close at 8 p.m. The last state to close its polls is Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. Here are when battleground state polls close and their electoral votes: —Thomas Franck The narrow Republican majority in the Senate is in play on Election Day. Whether it stays Republican or flips Democratic could determine the size of any additional coronavirus stimulus package, which has remained elusive for months. The Republican Senate has been pushing for less than a quarter of the $2.2 trillion package passed last month in the Democratic-controlled House. The White House has generally been offering something in the middle. Talks to try to get more stimulus before the election between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had showed glimmers of promise but ultimately failed. — Matthew J. Belvedere The presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden and key Senate races aren’t the only outcomes to watch today and the days to come. Here’s a list of ballot propositions across the country that NBC News will be tracking: —Hannah Miao Don’t get too excited about the early vote tallies this election night, warned David Wasserman, the House editor for the Cook Political Report and an NBC News contributor. While Americans are used to having a pretty good idea of where votes stand on election night, Wasserman said the large numbers of mailed and early votes this year could skew initial results. That’s because more Democrats than Republicans are expected to vote by mail or early as opposed to on Election Day and states have varying rules about when election officials can begin counting different types of ballots. In states like Florida, North Carolina and Texas, for example, mailed and early votes will likely be reported first, according to Wasserman, and could favor Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Wasserman said this “blue mirage” could be “erased” or diminished once Election Day votes are tallied. On the flip side, in the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a “red mirage” may appear to show President Donald Trump taking the lead initially because those states bar election officials from counting early and mailed ballots until either the day of or day before Election Day. Such a lead could be narrowed or overtaken once all those mailed and early ballots are counted. —Lauren Feiner North Carolina, Florida and Ohio will be key to victory for President Donald Trump or Democratic nominee Joe Biden, Republican pollster and political strategist Frank Luntz told CNBC. “If Donald Trump wins all three of them, he’s going to be in this,” Luntz said on “Squawk Box.” “If Biden wins even one of those three, it’s Biden’s presidency.” The three states all began processing mail ballots before Election Day and expect to have results by Wednesday morning, therefore offering an early look at each candidate’s prospects. Luntz said if the president can win all three states, the election outcome may hinge on the results in Pennsylvania, which may take some time. The state did not start processing ballots until 7 a.m. Tuesday and cannot begin counting ballots until polls close on Election Day. Trump won North Carolina, Florida and Ohio in 2016. —Hannah Miao Some airline crews will lodge at airport hotels and avoid downtown accommodations just in case there are protests and unrest during and following Election Day. United Airlines pilots with layovers in seven cities this week, including Washington, Chicago, Portland, Oregon and Philadelphia, will stay close to the airport “out of an abundance of caution,” the pilots’ union told members. “In order to prevent any potential delays of our crewmembers getting to where they need to be on time, we have relocated some of our crews to airport hotels,” a United Airlines
spokesman said in a statement. United and Alaska Airlines
flight attendants will also change to airport hotels away from some city centers, according to the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, their union. Airlines regularly switch crews’ hotels during special events, demonstrations, natural disasters and other issues, but the move tied to an election is unusual, according to unions. “We are closely monitoring the situation and will make adjustments as needed,” an American Airlines
spokesman said in a statement. “The safety of our team members is our highest priority.” The Allied Pilots Association, the union of American’s roughly 14,000 pilots, told members to “exercise increased vigilance with regard to personal security during the coming days, as election-related unrest may occur.” The union told pilots to avoid large groups, protests and going out alone. Delta Air Lines
said it can change crew hotels when warranted but declined to provide specifics “out of many safety and security considerations.” — Leslie Josephs Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden began Election Day by attending Mass at St. Joseph of the Brandywine Catholic church in Wilmington, Delaware. Following services, the Biden family visited the burial plot of Biden’s elder son, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Joe Biden has often said that Beau’s encouragement was a major factor in his decision to run for president. Also buried at the cemetery are Biden’s first wife and his daughter, who were both killed in a car accident in 1972. Biden was joined by his wife, Jill Biden, and by two of their granddaughters. Biden is expected to make several stops in Pennsylvania throughout the day Tuesday, and to address the nation Tuesday night from Wilmington. – Christina Wilkie The final CNBC/Change Research States of Play polls came in last night.

Trump went to Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all states he won in 2016. Biden, meanwhile, focused heavily on Pennsylvania and made a stop in Ohio. As usual, their messages couldn’t have diverged sharply. Biden hammered Trump over his response to the coronavirus pandemic and vowed to act as a uniter if he is elected.

On Monday, Biden traveled to South Carolina — the state that rescued his 2020 presidential bid — to argue they should rally to his side again despite misgivings about his handling of the economy, his age and the administration’s halting progress on issues like voting rights, student loans and police reform. Instead, Biden offered a sweeping and at times emotional plea from the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME in Charleston, a historic Black church where a White supremacist gunman killed nine people in 2015. Biden evoked the history of the American Civil War and said that former President Donald Trump and Republicans were seeking to mount a “second lost cause” that would disenfranchise and disadvantage Black Americans.  Biden needs Black communities in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit to turn out in November in order to carry states that will decide the 2024 election. But polls show those same voters have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration on key issues. Trump, the GOP frontrunner, is eager to chip away at Biden’s electoral coalition ahead of their likely rematch. At the church, Biden keyed in on his likely Republican opponent, pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, when Trump supporters sought to invalidate an election in which Black voters helped propel Biden to victory. “In their world, all these Americans, including you, don’t count,” Biden said. “But that’s not the real world. That’s not democracy. That’s not America. In America, we all count.” ‘He’s a Loser’ “Losers are taught to concede when they lose,” Biden said of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “He’s a loser.” Biden’s first two campaign events of the year have taken him to Pennsylvania, the state that delivered him the White House in 2020, and South Carolina, where Black Democratic voters gave him his first primary victory that year. “It’s not possible for a Democrat to be elected president of the United States without winning the African-American vote,” Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks told reporters Monday after the speech. “We want to continue to earn their continued support or work to earn their continued support.” Biden has pivoted to directly targeting his Republican challengers in recent weeks. On Friday, he spoke near the historic Revolutionary War site of Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, making a stark case to voters that Trump is a danger to democracy who should not return to office.  Monday’s speech brought him to the home state of another Republican contender, Nikki Haley, who has also struggled on issues of race. Haley was governor of South Carolina during the Charleston shooting and gained national attention by urging lawmakers there to remove a Confederate flag from the state house grounds. Haley, though, drew criticism from figures in both parties last month for initially failing to name slavery as a cause of the American Civil War. Biden referenced the controversy Monday. “They say they embrace what’s known as the lost cause: the self-serving lie that the Civil War is not about slavery, but about states’ rights. They call that the noble cause. That was a lie,” Biden said. “Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: slavery was the cause of the Civil War.” Haley’s campaign responded that Biden had a history of making insensitive comments on race and praising segregationists. Polling Woes Biden’s visit to the state that gave him one of his defining political moments comes at a weak point in his reelection bid, with polls showing him trailing Trump in swing states amid voter unease.  His favorability among Black voters in seven swing states has slipped 7 percentage points since October to 61% in December, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. Trump’s held steady at about 25%. Older Black voters tend to be a reliable group for Democrats but Biden’s troubles lie with younger voters, who question his handling of the Israel-Hamas war and want him to more aggressively champion progressive policies.  A handful of protesters interrupted Biden’s remarks Monday, calling for a cease-fire in the war. “I understand their passion and I am quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce significantly and get out of Gaza,” Biden said.  White House efforts to address some issues important to Black voters, such as gun violence and student-debt relief, have been stymied by congressional Republicans and the Supreme Court. --With assistance from Stephanie Lai and Hadriana Lowenkron.

,,"Photo by AP Photo/Susan Walsh He would be 82 years old at the start of a second term, the oldest president in history. Democratic voters are not excited by him, polls show, and many Democrat politicians say privately they wish there was an alternative candidate for their party to push in 2024. But on Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced in a video he would indeed seek reelection, and now the only question is who his opponent will be. Will it be a 2020 rematch of 2020 with former President Donald Trump (who would be 78 in 2024)? Will Florida Governor Ron DeSantis run? Will another GOP candidate rise? What Biden makes clear in his video announcement is that he plans to will run on his political accomplishments, his work to lower the temperature of the country after Trump’s presidency, and his determination to, in his words, “finish the job” that he started. “The question we are facing is whether in the years ahead we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer,” Biden says in the video. “I know what I want the answer to be. This is not a time to be complacent.” Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, wasted no time in responding to Biden’s news in a statement: “Biden is so out-of-touch that after creating crisis after crisis, he thinks he deserves another four years. If voters let Biden ‘finish the job,’ inflation will continue to skyrocket, crime rates will rise, more fentanyl will cross our open borders, children will continue to be left behind, and American families will be worse off.” So, what are the issues that will define Biden’s reelection campaign? BU Today reached out to faculty experts across the University and asked them to share their insights. Treat Donald Trump as yesterday’s news. Biden has to stand on his own merits here. He doesn’t even have to mention Donald Trump. He wants Donald Trump because Trump is the proverbial bull in the china shop. Trump’s making reckless charges, acting increasingly irrational at his rallies. He’s becoming more and more extreme, but the American electorate, for the most part, is in the middle. The vast majority of voters are independents and they don’t cotton well to that kind of extremism. It works for the GOP base, which is largely white, evangelical, conservative, and authoritarian, but it won’t work outside of the GOP primaries. The vast bulk of independent voters—especially women—are not going to be willing to go down that kind of road. They’ll look for a more middle-of-the-road candidate which, in this case, will be Joe Biden.  Additionally, demographics show that people under 50 years of age—millennials and Gen Z—are far more policy-driven and they’re less inclined to agree with the extremist baby boom ideology that Trump is espousing. That’s a major problem for the Republican party. And there’s a larger problem for the GOP—the party is not attractive to younger voters. Their base is literally dying and if you don’t replace them with younger voters, you’re setting yourself up for long-term irrelevance, politically speaking.  Biden needs to focus on issues that matter to younger voters: student loan forgiveness, reproductive rights, affordable housing and healthcare, the Green New Deal, and gun control.  On top of everything, it seems like the justice system will do Joe Biden’s job for him regarding Trump, painting him as an unfit candidate for office. We’ve never had a major candidate since Eugene Debs running for office under this cloud of illegality and perhaps even treason. Trump faces federal, state, local, and even civil charges in multiple cases that paint him as a common criminal who considers himself above the law. Unless our society has changed to the point where it no longer matters, we’re not in the habit of electing convicted felons or criminals to the highest office in the land.  If Trump is indicted and convicted for his role in the January 6 insurrection, under the terms of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, he would be barred from holding federal office. All together, this spells doom for Trump’s bid for a second term as president.  Regarding DeSantis, he has already jumped the shark. He’s tried to out-Trump Donald Trump to win the GOP nomination with his increasingly shrill and extremist views and policies: case in point, his war against Mickey Mouse and Disney. It’s become a national joke. It might work in Florida, but it won’t hold sway with independent voters. DeSantis is coming across as a tribute band to Donald Trump, and a rather weak one at that. Biden’s goal here should be to embrace the center and hold onto his liberal base—but his liberal base here really has nowhere to go. Liberals have grown up, thanks to Donald Trump. They may not get exactly what they want from Joe Biden, but they’ve come to recognize they’ll get enough from him.  I respectfully disagree that “Democrats” aren’t thrilled Biden is running again. Are there some Democrats that would have preferred a different candidate? Sure. But the party leadership sees Biden as the party’s best shot to beat Trump in 2024 and Biden’s approval rating among Democrats is 80 percent (according to Gallup)—not a perfect indicator of broader support, but suggestive that he hasn’t been abandoned by copartisans. I don’t know whether Biden has to “energize” the electorate—270 unenthusiastic electoral votes spend the same as 270 excited ones, after all—but he does have to get voters to cast ballots. To that end, he could be well served by the lesson of 2020: when voting is easier, people are more likely to do it.  Voter turnout was higher in 2020 than any presidential election in the past 100 years—a fact partially attributable to the availability of vote by mail. Even though the federal government has very little control over how states run their elections, Biden could directly and indirectly pressure state governments to maintain (or even expand) the availability of mail-in ballots.  There might be something Biden could do to win over Trump supporters, but it shouldn’t be a centerpiece of his campaign strategy. Voting patterns are tightly linked to age, race, and educational attainment, and the national trends on all three of these factors are favorable for Democratic candidates. Even within “swing states” in the Electoral College, demographics are shifting in Democrats’ favor. It would be irrational for Biden to divert attention from mobilizing the faithful to converting his skeptics. His campaign should focus on voter registration and turnout. Given that polling shows economic concerns are top on the minds of voters, the state of the economy heading into the election cycle matters. The ongoing strength of the US economy, including historically low unemployment, respectable GDP growth, and an uptick in consumer spending are positive economic messaging that the Biden administration will stress in their reelection campaign. There are other economic indicators that the Republicans will undoubtedly use to tar the Biden administration as failing the average voter, including stubbornly high inflation, lofty housing costs, and soaring prices of basic goods, including groceries. The Republicans will also try to stress that interest rates are too high and a tax on the average voter. The state of the economy will be front and center for this coming election cycle. Future US economic conditions are a key problem facing President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Swing votes are often swayed by economic issues, which impact voters’ pocketbooks. The misery index, which adds together the unemployment and inflation rate, is a good indicator of whether swing voters will stick with a president or switch. Currently, the unemployment rate is 3.5 percent and the inflation rate is 5 percent.  President Biden’s 8.5 percent index is right in the middle of the range compared to past presidents. This number suggests Biden has a high likelihood of reelection. However, if a recession occurs and unemployment surges or inflation stays stubbornly high, then the Biden campaign might face its own reelection misery. As President Biden announces his intent to run for re-election, a collective groan could be heard from immigration advocates. President Biden’s record so far on immigration has been, in a word, disappointing. It’s not that we never had hope for this Administration’s immigration policy—it’s that we did. Biden’s immigration platform was bold, progressive, and a welcome response to years of President Trump’s relentless attacks on noncitizens, and asylum seekers in particular. But President Biden has seemed a long way from candidate Biden—a then presidential hopeful who spoke with great promise and passion about reestablishing asylum protections, ending unlawful border restrictions and “restor[ing] our moral standing in the world and our historic role as a safe haven for refugees and asylum seekers.”  Yes, this Administration has expanded humanitarian parole for certain groups of Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians, but ongoing restrictions at the border and a failure to end Title 42 have meant that the border has been shut to so many more, among them some of the most vulnerable. In addition, this Administration drastically expanded the surveillance of noncitizens through ankle monitors and smartphone applications, and failed to provide long term security for Dreamers, or a pathway for new DACA applicants to receive protection. It is likely with reluctance that immigration advocates will embrace this re-election campaign. Hopefully, rather than hue toward the center politically, President Biden will embrace a compassionate, common sense and lawful approach to immigration policy that deemphasizes enforcement and delivers on his promises from his previous campaign. Biden needs to show how he will make a deal with the powerful oil companies that involves them winding down their activities, and not expanding into plastics.  The curtailment of fossil fuel extraction is the key to a new, unpoisoned world and it’s not an easy one to turn, but it is the one that opens the door to a new future.  Companies that are invested in the old ways of doing business are doubling down now and backing Republicans with all they have, and participating in democracy in an unethical manner, distorting the processes that should reflect the will and the needs of the people.  The will of the people is clear, that we need to act on climate change, and the science, technology and economics are clear that we can have a clean transition.  We won’t have it tomorrow, but today is when we have to get started.  Biden has to start America down that path. I watched the video announcing Biden’s reelection campaign and found a few things noteworthy. First was evoking the specter of the January 6 insurrection. There have been efforts among some to downplay its significance or even deny that it happened. The insurrection was nothing less than a 9/11-level attack on the peaceful transfer of power and should remain seared in public memory. While not explicitly mentioning fascism, Biden frames the election as having higher stakes than simply whether a Republican or Democrat occupies the White House. It is helpful to remind voters that this is not a “politics-as-usual” moment we are living through. It was good to see connections made between things like reproductive rights, book bans, and voter suppression as part of a broader assault on freedom. The overall message echoes rhetoric we have heard from the Biden administration over the past few years on these issues. But people can’t eat rhetoric, and fascism will not be defeated by political messaging.  I am reminded of this observation by Frederick Douglass in 1866: “…no republic is safe that tolerates a privileged class, or denies to any of its citizens equal rights and equal means to maintain them.”  The past few years have been a reminder that freedom is fragile and democracy is vulnerable. This will remain the case without addressing an economic and political system that primarily serves the wealthy, fails to consistently uphold basic human rights, and withholds the means for many to prosper and fully participate in political life. The ongoing Republican attack on Americans is alarming. Republicans have made stripping rights from anyone who is transgender a central part of their party identity. While their efforts are seen as focused on a minority, there is no mistake that they are setting up an infrastructure to eliminate anyone who does not fit their narrow view of who is American. In contrast, the Biden administration has achieved much to safeguard LGBTQ Americans with a particular focus on transgender Americans. Though some would argue these issues “distract” from larger economic concerns facing the nation, attacks on any Americans by Republican-led local and state governments, such as Florida, Missouri, and Nebraska, strike at the very core of our national values. As Biden prepares for the 2024 election, he and his team must not deflect questions about LGBTQ rights and, in fact, should be prepared to lead any debate on these issues. Biden and his team can win more hearts and minds by standing their ground and protecting Americans of all genders and sexual orientations and highlighting how un-American the current Republican Party has become.  I am not worried about Biden’s chronological age. There is increasing evidence that biological age, not chronological age, is what is associated with age-related diseases, including cognitive impairment. Although Biden is 80 years old, his actions and behavior lead me to believe that his biological age is significantly younger than 80.  The cognitive skills relevant to being president are myriad. Executive function—the ability to manage complex data and use it to plan for the future—is particularly important for a president. Episodic memory—the ability to remember events and information—is also important. I’ll also mention that no one person could possibly be able to manage all of the data and remember all of the events and information that a president needs to function effectively; it will also require a team to get the job done.  Thomas Perls, professor of medicine, Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine; director, New England Centenarian Study Joe Biden is only four years older than Donald Trump. According to a medical summary by his physician, his medical issues are: atrial fibrillation, for which he takes a blood thinner, apixaban, which is very effective at preventing strokes; hyperlipidemia, for which he takes Crestor, result[ing] in a normal lipid profile; acid reflux, for which he takes Pepcid; and stiffened gait due to moderate to severe spondylosis and osteoarthritis of his spine. Of note, his blood pressure is normal (128/76) without meds. Many Americans in their 80s and 90s are in very good physical and cognitive health. For that matter, most centenarians who are at least 20 years older than Biden on average experience significant (impacts their function) medical and/or cognitive problems after their mid-90s. I see no indication that Biden is not among the 80 percent of people in their 80s who do not show evidence of dementia. Furthermore, he has none of the risk factors that make cognitive impairment more likely, such as diabetes, obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, or elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol; he’s in excellent health, especially for his age—all of which makes him much less likely to have cognitive issues down the road. I have read that there are some people saying that presidents who are at an older age should undergo detailed neuropsychological testing to determine they are cognitively in good shape. As a geriatrician, we do not perform such tests unless a person is demonstrating increasing and persistent or worsening difficulty with tasks or activities that require concentration or planning. People should not be concerned about losing their keys or forgetting someone’s name; that may happen if we haven’t had a good night’s sleep. It’s when these issues are persistent and worsening that we become concerned. I think misinformation will most certainly be central to the 2024 election in a variety of ways. For starters, it will be very interesting to see who takes over Tucker Carlson’s mantle over at Fox News, and therefore, the mantle of monetizing misinformation and fear under the guise of journalism. I suspect it will get ugly with different Fox News personalities trying to outdo each other to cater to that vast market that made Carlson one of the most successful personalities on cable. Carlson’s own future and what he might bring to different campaigns, either as an official campaign member or as a surrogate, in terms of weaponizing disinformation and outrage, will also play a role, I believe. Misinformation in the MAGAsphere and beyond will remain alive and well and play a role in the outcome of the election—and the Biden campaign needs to be ready with much more effective messaging and counters to it. The Republicans already have a roadmap of successfully deflecting from what should be legislative priorities to using misinformation to create fester[ing] culture wars and creating lightning rods out of what may be considered nonissues, like banning drag shows and books from classrooms. I suspect that deflection will continue throughout the 2024 campaign and the Biden campaign needs to be ready. I don’t know how much the actual outcome of the [Russia-Ukraine] war or any US support for Ukraine—which is not direct support, but in the form of military and civilian aid—will actually affect the election. But I do know it is a major source of disinformation that is targeted to the US electorate. So, I don’t have a prediction for the outcome, but I would warn everyone to be on the watch for misinformation during the election season that will dial up significantly.  The midterms sent a message that voters are motivated when abortion is on the ballot in some way. After so many years of politicians treating abortion as a political hot potato, we see that abortion is politically popular, even in some conservative states, where voters aren’t willing to be as extreme as politicians there may want them to be. Having a Democrat on the ticket is going to invoke messaging about protecting reproductive healthcare at every level of government, and presidential elections historically bring strong voter turnout, so we’ll continue to see this be a major issue, I think. A lot of this is being fought out at the state level, but at the same time, who’s in the White House is highly important. One of the reasons that a federal judge enjoined mifepristone across the entire country is because he was a Trump appointee. Now, Biden has had some success in getting his appointees on federal benches. If you elect a Republican [president], you interrupt that momentum, whereas if Biden is reelected, you have more opportunities to put judges on the courts. This is not to mention what could happen on the Supreme Court—if a justice retires or leaves the bench, whoever is in the White House has control over their replacement. More recently, we’ve seen the [Food and Drug Administration] roll back some of its more restrictive policies about medication abortion, but a new administration could change the head of the agency and push policies through that would reverse that direction, so the [abortion fight at the] national level does matter. Now, people have been urging Biden to do more with abortion—including saying the word “abortion”—but the White House has taken steps to protect reproductive rights. We don’t know yet what’s going to happen in this lawsuit against the FDA. If there’s anything more that the Biden administration can do to fortify the FDA’s support of medication abortion, and fortify access to those drugs, that would be important in the upcoming months. There are some Democratic senators, like Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren [both of Massachusetts], who have urged Biden to do more to strengthen HIPAA, to make clear what kind of resources people have who seek abortions outside their home states—there’s a whole laundry list of things that Democratic lawmakers think Biden could do to strengthen abortion access right now. There’s a mantra that’s important because it’s true: abortion is healthcare. I hope we see this administration embrace that and talk about the bigger picture of reproductive health moving forward.

Once again, we presented a naked king and invited to adore his elegant clothing. This article was truly hilarious. Just read the completely erroneous claims about age not being a issue. Anyone with a measure of integrity or honesty would say that Biden has been deteriorating precipitously. But sure, he will be even better when he’s 82 LOL It’s funny to think that Americans are excited Biden is running for re-election when his health is deteriorating rapidly, our economy is terrible and on the global market the dollar is losing power, we’re losing the respect of other nations, etc etc. But sure a bunch of false promises of gifted money, rights, and a “plan of action” will work. Way to work the narrative that everybody wants democrats in power. Would it hurt the folks interviewed in these sorts of articles to answer questions about the electorate… from the perspective of, y’know, the electorate? Why on Earth would the average voter in Ohio care about Disney’s operations in Florida? And if roughly 50% of voters don’t support medical transitioning for minors or transgender women competing in women’s sports, are the interviewees seriously arguing that 50% of this country are”un-American” “fascists”? The age issue, too, is clear partisanship. Beyond any potential health issues, there is something deeply philosophically wrong about going on record to a college magazine and telling a bunch of 18-22 year olds how they should be okay with an octogenarian president. (And yes, I’d unequivocally say the same thing about Trump.) How healthy can a society be, really, if young people are increasingly underrepresented in government? With falling birth rates, the selfish refusal of seniors (from both parties) to retire from office, the disproportionate impact the recent lockdowns/Covid policies had on young people, the utter lack of sympathy towards issues like rising rent/home prices/layoffs/etc… I suspect that it would be wise for the 40+ crowd to offer an olive branch to us youngins while you still can. Seeing as, well, you guys do need us to like you all enough to pay for your retirements! ;) For most a vote for Biden is viewed as a vote for a President Kamala Harris. She is NOT viewed favorably. Biden never should have announced a re-election campaign. Age is a major issue and Biden looks older everyday.
The Republican have two major issues: 1) they went too far on abortion so there will be backlash from moderate R’s and independents, and 2) Trump’s legal issues will begin to bite which maybe why he is becoming more unhinged.
The American people want other choices. There is a good shot that neither Biden nor Trump get their parties nomination and a dark horse rides to the rescue. My sense is that most people hope so. I know I do. It feels like Biden is in a strange middle ground. Those of the upper class obviously aren’t keen on voting for a democrat (especially the billionaires) since they don’t like getting heavily taxed, but those who are of the low class are also not keen on voting for Biden since the economy is making it hard for people to buy basic necessities. As far as I’m aware the economy isn’t bad at the moment, but it’s being presented as bad to the people who are being affected by it at the lowest level. It’s easy to take common things like high gas prices and expensive eggs and turn them into a weapon against the current leadership.
The environment is something that everyone SHOULD get behind protecting since it literally will affect all of us sooner or later. But those of a higher class seem to not care too much about this issue likely because they are in the group who will be affected ‘later’ by that issue. The climate seems to primarily be an issue that will devastate the lower and middle class since they won’t have the resources to move out of danger areas. The climate could be something that candidates lean into more especially with global warming getting worse by the day.
Even though democrats wish to push forth a lot of programs that could help low income people, it feels like those programs are pushed onto those who don’t even want them. This seems to be especially true for the Midwest. It’s honestly somewhat sad to see democrat candidates struggle in those regions because they seem completely disconnected from the way of life there. They lack the cultural capital that is required to connect with the people of that region, and those people can be painted as ignorant bigots by people who are quick to judge. Having one’s voter base label a certain group of people in a negative way and then giving up on that region will only cause contempt to fester harder and harder. I personally think it would be valuable for Biden to hire people or recruit people from areas like the Midwest during his campaign so that he can gain some of that cultural capital I mentioned earlier. Because at this stage, all of the objectified capital that he could provide through programs or funding wouldn’t get through to a base that understandably doesn’t like him.

,," That’s a mischaracterization. Basically he cracked a joke that it was absurd that a black person would struggle with choosing between him and the guy endorsed by the KKK. And when you think about it, it is remarkably absurd that anyone of color would vote for someone who used as much racist rhetoric as IQ 45. He said it on The Morning Show, to a black host who was pushing his buttons to be sure. Biden’s point—stated as badly as he could possibly state it—was that any black person who votes for a party whose elected officials are 97% white men should be questioning his life choices. Trump is the most blatantly racist President since Woodrow Wilson. Back in the 1970s Trump was convicted of refusing to rent apartments to blacks—systematically. He called for the execution of the Central Park Five who later were exonerated, and he still wouldn’t retract what he’d said. Republicans love to pounce on this                  The best response I’ve read to this goes something like this. What Joe said was what black people think. We look at white people who want to vote for Trump like they're fucking crazy, and they are. We look at black people who want to vote for Trump like they're white people. They get all the shame of being white with none of the benefits. As a black person, why would you think the person who took out a full page ad accusing the Central Park 5 of rape and murder after evidence had surfaced to the contrary. Or maintain the birther conspiracy for years after Obama produced his long form; not sure T    That is completely out of context. Listen to the interview, He was making a joke. Charlamagne did not react to his comment at all, don’t you think he would have if it was ugly or racist. Take a look at the number of black Americans the Republicans have in the Senate and the House. You can cut off your right hand and a couple of digits on your left and still have enough fingers to count on. Biden joked if your voting for Donald Trump you ain’t black, basically meaning you’re not paying attention. Donald Trump during his campaign rally said “where is my African American”.

,"U.S. Voters: Biden, Most in House Don't Deserve Another Term","WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Fewer than four in 10 U.S. registered voters say President Joe Biden deserves to be reelected, while less than a quarter say the same about most members of the U.S. House. As is almost always the case, voters are more inclined to believe the U.S. representative from their own district should be returned to Congress, with 55% holding that view. These results are based on a Jan. 2-22 Gallup poll. The 38% of voters who say Biden deserves a second term is slightly lower than the 41% of Americans who approve of the job he is doing in the same survey. Voters are somewhat more willing to say Biden should be returned to office now than they were when Gallup last asked the question in June 2022 (33%), leading up to that year’s midterm elections. As would be expected, the vast majority of Democratic registered voters (82%) versus few Republican voters (3%) believe Biden should be reelected. At 29%, independent voters’ support for a second Biden term is much closer to that of Republicans than Democrats. Independents are the least likely party group to believe most members of Congress, and their own member, deserve to be reelected. Less than half of independents say their own representative should receive another term, compared with more than six in 10 Republicans and Democrats. In January of prior incumbent reelection years, Gallup asked whether former Presidents Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush deserved reelection. The same question was asked about George W. Bush (October 2003) and Barack Obama (December 2011) late in the years before they sought reelection. Of these, the younger Bush (who won reelection) had the highest reelect figure, at 53%, while two incumbents who lost, Trump at 50% and the elder Bush at 49%, scored just below. Although Biden’s current rating ranks lowest among the readings for the past six presidents, his 38% is most similar to Clinton’s 44% and Obama’s 43%, both of whom won a second term. Biden can take some solace in the fact that voter sentiment about whether a president deserves reelection has often changed over the course of prior election years. After receiving subpar reelection support early on, Obama and Clinton saw significant improvement, resulting in election wins: Conversely, two presidents saw their promising early readings dwindle between January and Election Day, to the point that they lost their reelection bids: The younger Bush’s reelection figures hovered around the 50% mark in three surveys leading up to the 2004 election, before he won a second term. Today’s congressional reelection figures are also lower than is typical for early readings in presidential election years. Slightly fewer U.S. registered voters in 2012 and 2016 thought their local representative deserved to be reelected than do now, but 60% or more did so in other years. The 24% who believe most members deserve reelection is lower than in all recent presidential election years except 2012, when 20% held that view in the late 2011 survey. The current figure is similar to that from 2016, but in all other years, 35% or more thought most members should be reelected, including a majority of 56% in 2000. Voters’ opinions of whether members of Congress deserve reelection have usually not changed much over the course of presidential election years. There have been exceptions, though -- as in 1992, when voters became much less inclined to want to reelect members, and in 2012, when there were modest increases in incumbent reelection sentiments. Voters are not enthusiastic about returning most elected federal officials to office. Biden trails other incumbents at similar points in their presidencies, and voters are less likely than in other recent election years to say members of Congress deserve reelection. While the numbers for Congress are unlikely to improve, based on historical patterns, Biden’s numbers could. He hopes to follow the paths of Clinton and Obama, whose electoral fortunes improved during their reelection years and saw them win second terms, rather than those of Trump and the elder George Bush, whose support for a second term deteriorated over the course of the election year.

"Ed O'Keefe, Allison Novelo, David Morgan","In Michigan, anger over Biden's Israel-Hamas war stance could cost him votes: ""We're gonna be silent in November 2024""","Watch CBS News December 11, 2023 / 9:22 AM EST / CBS News Four years ago, Adam Abusalah campaigned for Joe Biden, urging his neighbors in predominantly Arab-American Dearborn, Michigan, to vote against Donald Trump. Today, the 23-year-old's concerns about President Biden are sounding an alarm bell for Democrats.  As the administration continues standing by Israel's deadly attacks on Gaza, Abusalah says he and his community can no longer support the president, given his steadfast support of Israel. ""If you were to ask me two months ago, if I was gonna vote for Joe Biden, yeah, I would've held my nose and voted for him,"" Abusalah said. But then, Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack on Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and Israel retaliated with devastating assaults on the Gaza Strip. The health ministry in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip says the overall death toll there since the start of the war had surpassed 15,200. Abusalah warns that anger in the U.S. over Israel's attacks could cost the president the election.  ""The same way that they're being silent right now in the face of injustices, we're gonna be silent in November 2024,"" Abusalah said. When asked whether Muslim Americans will stay home on Election Day, Abusalah replied, ""No, we're gonna go vote. But we're gonna keep the top of the ticket empty."" When faced with a prospective Biden loss, which could mean a Trump presidency, Abusalah said, ""If you were to tell me that my vote would be the vote, whether Biden wins in Michigan or not, I would still not vote for Biden. … My people dying is that much of an issue for me."" Abdullah Hammoud, Dearborn's first-ever Arab-American mayor, says for many here, the Israel-Hamas war is deeply personal.  ""We have some residents who've lost entire families,"" he said. A Democrat, the mayor credits legislation signed by the president for pumping tens of millions of dollars of federal aid into his city.  ""The domestic policies that President Biden has achieved have been nothing short of phenomenal,"" Hammoud said. But he has his own strong views on what's happening in Gaza.  ""You cannot overlook the genocide that's taken place, and you have to weigh that on a scale,"" he said. He believes that Mr. Biden's response to the Oct. 7 attacks has been ""awful."" Holding Michigan, a swing state, is key to a Biden victory in 2024. In 2020 Mr. Biden defeated Trump there by about 154,000 votes; 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the state, with nearly 70% nationwide going for the president.   A CBS News poll released Sunday shows that 38% of Democrats believe the president is showing ""too much"" support for Israel, up from 28% in October.  Osama Siblani, the co-founder and former president of the Arab American Political Action Committee (AAPAC), Mr. Biden reached out to this organization prior to his election in 2020 and said he promised to include an Arab American in his cabinet. ""We don't have a cabinet member. We don't have an assistant, deputy, whatever,"" Siblani said. ""We don't even have a standing place in the room with Joe Biden. Biden and both senators won because of our vote. There is one thing for sure; that at this time, if the election were held today, American Muslims will not vote for the top ticket."" A Biden campaign spokesperson says the president continues to work closely and proudly with leaders in the Muslim and Palestinian communities across the country, while the White House says it is tirelessly working to increase the urgent delivery of aid to people in Gaza. There are some Arab American voters in the region who have not completely withdrawn their support for the president. Ahmed Boomrad, the executive chairman of GDI Integrated Facility Services, empathizes with his community's frustration but refrains from harshly judging the administration. Despite the challenges, he intends to cast his vote in favor of Mr. Biden in 2024. ""Can the administration do more? Absolutely. But If I'm being fair, the Biden administration has had real achievements,"" Boomrad said. Boomrad pointed to Mr. Biden repealing the Muslim ban, appointing a record number of Muslim Americans, including federal court judges, and helping to resolve the longstanding Lebanese Israeli maritime border dispute, during the early days of his presidency. But younger voters are more like Abusalah and less forgiving of the president. At the Michigan State University campus in Lansing, where students gathered in late November to demand a ceasefire, several protestors held signs, in which some read ""No Ceasefire No Vote,"" while others said ""Biden: Fund Climate Action Not Genocide."" Some students even dubbed the president as ""Genocide Joe."" A Lebanese student, Alissa Hakim, 21, a senior at MSU, said Mr. Biden has lost her vote. Instead, she implored her fellow peers to vote for an independent candidate. ""With the way things are now, I'm not very hopeful that it won't be another Biden vs. Trump candidacy, but I would implore people to vote third party rather than abstain,"" Hakim said.

,Poll: Nearly half of voters have ruled out sup­porting Biden and Trump,"       A little more than 17 months before the 2024 presidential election, voters have a better idea of which candidates they absolutely won’t vote for than the one they will support, according to a new Monmouth University poll. The poll, released Thursday, asked voters about the likelihood they would support a particular candidate in three hypothetical general-election matchups. All three scenarios included President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. Those surveyed were asked about Biden facing either former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or former Vice President Mike Pence, all Republicans. The goal of the poll was to gauge each candidate’s floor and ceiling. “Negative opinion can be difficult to shift, and when it does it tends to be in the wrong direction for the candidate,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “That’s not to say these views won’t change in the next year and a half, but these results are a sign of how few voters are truly up for grabs in our hyper-partisan political environment.” Just under half of voters — 46% to 48% — said they definitely would not vote for Biden in any of the three matchups, with another 7% to 8% saying they probably would not vote for the incumbent president. Thirty-two percent said they definitely would support and 13% said they’d likely support Biden against Trump. The backing for Biden was similar in a DeSantis matchup — 31% definitely voting for the current president, 12% probably voting for him. The percentage of the electorate already ruling out Trump is about the same, the poll found. Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they definitely won’t vote for Trump  if he faces Biden, with another 8% saying they probably would not support the former president. Twenty-nine percent said they would definitely cast their ballot for Trump, and 12% more said they probably would. Fewer poll participants said they are dismissing the possibility of voting for DeSantis or Pence, although both of the Republicans are lagging behind both Trump and Biden when it comes to ardent supporters. Forty-one percent said they definitely won’t vote for DeSantis over Biden — and 11% said they probably would not — while 26% said they’d definitely support the Florida governor and 16% percent said they probably would. Thirty-six percent ruled out supporting Pence against Biden, and 18% said they probably would not vote for him. Eighteen percent said they’d definitely support Pence, and another 22% said they probably would. When looking strictly at definite and probable support, Biden outperformed his hypothetical opponent in all three scenarios: 45% to 41% against Trump, 43% to 42% against DeSantis and 42% to 40% against Pence.

,What Voters Could Biden's VP Pick Mobilize?,"With Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic nominee, there has been speculation about who he will choose to be his running mate. Biden has pledged that his vice-presidential pick will be a woman stating, “There are a number of women who qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president.” After making this commitment in mid-March, journalists and political pundits wasted no time generating lists of qualified women who Joe Biden could potentially choose to be his running mate. Despite pundits and party elites placing an outsized level of importance on the VP pick, rarely has a vice presidential running mate had more than a trivial impact on an election outcome. However, we arguably face the most important and consequential presidential election in modern history. In the context of global pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of Americans, devastated the economy, left millions of Americans unemployed, and pushed our healthcare system to the brink, Biden’s pick for VP choice may be perceived as far more meaningful than in past elections. Furthermore, given Biden’s age, there is a distinct possibility that whoever he chooses will be running a presidential race in 2024. So much of the perceived strategy of Biden’s choice hinges on what we think is more crucial to Biden’s success- “persuasion targets” verses “turnout targets.” Is the goal to increase turnout among younger voters and voters of color? Given the difference in turnout between 2012 and 2016 among black voters and the expanding Latino electorate in key states, this is a prudent goal. One of the most defining divides in the Democratic primary was the age difference in support for Biden, with voters under 45 more likely to have supported Bernie Sanders and voters over 45 more likely to support Biden. Furthermore, young voters (who are also more likely to be voters of color) simply turn out to vote at much lower levels. Polling shows that Biden has a huge lead over Trump with young voters, but this issue will inevitably be one of turnout. But is the more important goal to target persuadable voters? These voters would include white voters in the Midwest (many who voted for Trump in 2016), white suburbanites, moderate and conservative voters, as well as Independents. Despite changing demographics in the U.S., white men still make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018, 41% of white men voted for Democrats and undoubtedly helped contribute to their success. Polling shows that the split among white voters by college education is essentially the same as it was in 2016; whites without a college degree support Trump over Biden by about 30 points. However, the same polling also highlights the fact that Biden has not significantly increased support among whites with a college degree. Speculation about the veepstakes is likely to pick up even more momentum as former Vice President Biden recently announced a panel of advisors to aid him in the selection of a running mate. Although there are many think pieces devoted to discussing who would be the smartest strategic pick for Biden, most fail to substantively discuss or provide data on what kind of voters each potential VP nominee might attract. Using relevant data from recent surveys, elections, and each potential VP’s past successes, I evaluate the types of voters each VP pick might be able to mobilize and how much of a boon that potential mobilization would be to the Biden campaign.   1. Stacey Abrams Stacey Abrams rose to national prominence when she ran as the Democratic candidate for Georgia governor in 2018. While some of the other potential running mates under consideration have remained coy about any vice-presidential ambitions, Abrams has been open about her desire to serve as Biden’s VP. She has noted her history of fighting to protect the right to vote, her experience serving as her party’s minority leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, and has argued that it would be a mistake for Joe Biden not to pick a black woman like herself. Abrams told Jake Tapper on CNN, “As a young black woman, growing up in Mississippi, I learned that if you don't raise your hand, people won't see you, and they won't give you attention.” Given Abrams newcomer status to national politics, there are limited data points to draw from that speak to the types of voters she might bring into the fold. But her past performances offer some insights. Abrams lost her gubernatorial bid to then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp by a thin margin. Kemp was overseeing the election that he competed in and enforced some of the most restrictive voting laws in the country, resulting in allegations of voter suppression. Despite this, more black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Latino voters turned out in Georgia’s 2018 midterm election than in the 2016 presidential election. Georgia was the only state where midterm turnout was greater than presidential turnout among voters of color. This speaks to Abrams’ ability to mobilize voters of color who might otherwise stay home on Election Day. Additionally, Abrams achieved this without losing the support for white voters. She won a larger share of the white vote than President Barack Obama. In the Data for Progress poll, 17% of black voters chose Abrams as their preferred VP nominee (second only to Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren at 22%). Furthermore, a plurality (21%) of black voters felt that Abrams would be the most effective in implementing policies as VP.   2.  Senator Tammy Baldwin Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has largely flown under the radar in the veepstakes discussion and has been left out of most national polling. Wisconsin is emerging as one of the most crucial (if not the most crucial) battleground state in the 2020 election. Baldwin has been in the Senate since 2013 and is the first openly LGBT member of the Senate. Although she lacks name recognition nationally, Senator Baldwin won her 2018 race by double digits. This is no small feat in a purple state like Wisconsin where Democrat Tony Evers beat Scott Walker in the 2018 gubernatorial race by a razor thin margin (slightly over 1%). In fact, about 8% of voters split their ticket and supported both Walker and Baldwin. Exit polls show that 10% of Republicans and 59% of Independents or non-affiliated voters voted for Baldwin. This fact speaks to Baldwin’s ability to put together a coalition that includes both progressives, Independents, and even some Trump supports. Another potential strength is her progressive bona fides. She is one of the most liberal members of the U.S. Senate. This could mobilize progressives who feel lukewarm about Biden.   3. Senator Tammy Duckworth Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth is another woman on this list who has made history. She won her 2016 election and became the second Asian American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, the first woman with a disability to be elected to Congress, and the first Senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is a combat veteran and was the first female double amputee from the Iraq War (her Black Hawk helicopter was shot down by Iraqi insurgents). She served in the house for four years before running for the Senate. Although Duckworth has not been included in many national polls, YouGov polling indicates that she is slightly more popular among millennials and men. In her 2016 Senate victory, she won only 17 out of Illinois’ 102 counties. Duckworth won by huge margins in terms of total votes in urban counties which secured her victory. According to CNN exit polls from 2016, she did particularly well among non-white voters, and notably, voters without a college degree as well as moderates and Independents. Senator Duckworth previously served as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs and was appointed by President Barack Obama to be the Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. She has a long history of advocating for vets. Although the relationship between electoral victory and candidate military experience is nuanced, researchers have found that people use candidates’ military service to make inferences about defense competence and interventionism that can lead to higher support among some groups of voters. Other work has found that voters overwhelming perceive candidates with military experience to be more competent in handling national security and defense issues. It’s difficult to extrapolate what this might mean in terms of any potential benefit to the Biden campaign. However, Duckworth’s distinct lived experience as a veteran, Asian-American woman, a person with a physical disability, and a new mother, might appeal to voters seeking representation and recognition in the next administration.
  4. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham Another governor that has garnered attention as a potential veep choice is New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Lujan Grisham became the first Latina Democratic woman governor in 2019, after serving three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. Despite holding these posts, Lujan Grisham’s national profile remains relatively low, reducing the amount of data from which to draw in predicting her influence on a presidential ticket. Elected from both a majority-Latino district and state and as the former head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Lujan Grisham would bring strong ties to the Latino community. This might help a Biden presidential ticket with mobilizing Latino voters. In the presidential primary, Sanders did far better with Latino voters than Biden. A recent survey from Latino Decisions shows support for Biden at 59% among Latinos, compared to just two months ago when it was at 67%. According to New York Times, Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc this fall. Latino support in key swing states like Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania could be decisive for Biden. It’s also worth noting, given the current public health crisis, that Governor Lujan Grisham began her career as a health commissioner in Bernalillo County and ultimately was appointed as New Mexico’s Secretary of Health. Lujan Grisham has also been garnering high approval ratings (62%) for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic.   5. Senator Kamala Harris Out of all the potential VP nominees, the one that has perhaps been cited the most as a likely pick is Senator Kamala Harris. In a March 2020 YouGov poll, 18% of Democratic primary voters selected Kamala Harris as their preferred choice for Biden’s running mate (second only to Warren). In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Harris was in the middle of pack with 10% of respondents choosing her as their preferred VP running mate. Her support, also in the Harvard poll, remains relatively stable across age groups, although older voters preferred her slightly more than younger voters. There was also a notable gap in support for Harris across racial lines with 16% of black voters selecting her verses 9% of white voters. However, it’s unclear how much of a benefit this is to the Biden coalition given his already deeply entrenched support in the black community. It’s also not a given that Kamala Harris, a black woman, would mobilize black voters. During the presidential race, Harris, as well as the only other black candidate in the race, Cory Booker, were unable to make inroads in South Carolina, a state where African Americans are about a third of the population and an even larger proportion of Democratic voters. One promising data point for Harris is that, in the March YouGov poll, she garnered the highest support among Hispanic voters (26%) in VP selection. The Latino vote will be an essential voting bloc in 2020. Based on these data points, it’s clear that while Democratic primary voters have generally warm feelings towards Kamala Harris, but her support among other groups suggests that she might have trouble generating enthusiasm outside of the existing Biden coalition.   6. Senator Amy Klobuchar Another potential VP pick is Senator Amy Klobuchar. Klobuchar has 63% favorability among Democratic primary voters according to the latest YouGov poll. The moderate Minnesota senator displays major strength among older voters, particularly those 65 and older. In the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, Klobuchar was the preferred VP choice for 19% of respondents 65 and older (the most popular choice among that age group) and 12% of voters 50-64 compared to only 3% of voters 18-34 and 5% of voters 35-49. These numbers indicate that Senator Klobuchar will better mobilize older voters. In the YouGov poll, she is the second highest in support from Democratic primary voters age 65+. However, it’s important to note that generally, these voters are already mobilized. We know that older people go to the polls at significantly larger numbers than younger people. According to CNN exit polls during the midterm election, 56% of voters were over age 50 and 26% were 65 or over. By comparison, only 13% of voters were under the age of 30 and this was considered a high turnout for young voters. Klobuchar clearly appeals to older voters but it’s unclear that would be a significant benefit to the Biden coalition. It is worth noting that in the Harvard poll, Klobuchar was tied with Sanders as the preferred candidate of voters who voted for Trump in 2016, suggesting she could pick off some Trump voters. During the presidential primary, where Klobuchar hit a stumbling block was with voters of color. She out-performed expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire (overwhelmingly white states), but failed to mobilize voters of color, particularly black voters, in Nevada and South Carolina, effectively ending her presidential bid.   7. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto made history when she became the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. She served as the Attorney General of Nevada from 2007 to 2015 but has not yet achieved much of a national profile. Cortez Masto was included on the most recent Data for Progress poll where she garnered only 1% of support from Democratic voters, most likely a result of her low name ID. As one of the very few Latina women in Congress and as a statewide representative of a state where Latinos are 29% of the population, Cortez Masto has the potential to and experience in mobilizing Latino voters. Her knowledge of and popularity in a swing state like Nevada is also worth weighing in considering her benefit to a presidential ticket.   8. Senator Elizabeth Warren It was only a month and a half ago that Senator Elizabeth Warren, once a front-runner, dropped out of the presidential race. A little over a week ago she endorsed Joe Biden and when asked by Rachel Maddow on MSNBC how she would respond if Biden asked her to serve as vice president, Warren responded “Yes.” Warren has been the leading woman candidate among Democrats in two recent polls. In an April 2020 Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll, 13% of all respondents chose Warren as their preferred VP pick.[1] This is second only to the 20% of respondents who chose Senator Bernie Sanders. When Data for Progress listed only women contenders in another April 2020 survey, 31% of Democratic respondents chose Warren, with Senator Kamala Harris coming in second with 18% of support. Notably, 42% of Democrats identified Warren as the potential vice presidential candidate most ready to be president. In a recent YouGov poll, Elizabeth Warren had the highest favorability (77%) among Democratic primary voters. Other YouGov polling suggests similarly positive feelings for Warren. A plurality of Democratic primary voters in a March 2020 poll said that Biden should select Warren as his VP. These data points highlight that the Democratic base generally has warm feelings towards Warren. However, conventional wisdom during and after her presidential bid was that the Massachusetts senator does better with women, more educated voters, and more liberal voters. The extant data seems to bear this out. Out of the five women candidates who were included as response options in the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the gender gap in support was the largest for Elizabeth Warren with 15% of women selecting Warren as their preferred pick compared to 11% of men in the survey. Similarly, YouGov polling from March indicates that among Democratic primary voters, 29% of women and 25% of men think that Elizabeth Warren should be selected as the nominee for vice-president. According to NBC exit polls, this gender gap was consistent in almost every presidential primary contest as well. In the presidential primary, Warren lost in her home state and struggled to win support among white men without college degrees (although Warren did do better with college-educated white men than with working class white women underscoring the complicated gender dynamics at play). Another weak spot for Warren is with Independent voters. Exit polls from her 2012 campaign for the U.S. Senate showed that her that her opponent, Scott Brown, did better with Independent voters, particularly men. This weak spot played out in the 2020 presidential primary in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada, and several other Super Tuesday states.   9. Governor Gretchen Whitmer Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has been floated as another potential running mate for Joe Biden, particularly as she rose to national consciousness because of her response to the Covid-19 pandemic and her outspoken criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the crisis. Whitmer has a long and successful electoral history, having served three terms in the Michigan House of Representatives and two terms in the Michigan Senate before her gubernatorial run in 2018. Given Michigan’s status as a crucial battleground state and the fact that Trump won Michigan in 2016 by the narrowest margin in the history of the state, it makes sense that Governor Whitmer is on the short list. Whitmer is rated favorably by 47% of Democratic primary voters, although it’s important to note that over 40% were unfamiliar with her. She is also popular in her state. Despite criticism from some Republicans over her aggressive response to Covid-19 and protests over the stay-at-home orders, Whitmer’s approval rating is 60% in Michigan (15 points higher than Trump’s approval rating in the state). With limited data, it’s difficult to discern what types of voters might be energized by Whitmer as a VP pick. In the Data for Progress poll, only 3% of Democratic voters chose Whitmer as their VP choice, which is likely a product of low name ID. However, her win in 2018 demonstrated her ability to put together a diverse coalition of black voters, suburban women, blue collar workers, and even voters in conservative parts of the state.   What does it all mean? When considering the potential VP nominees (although this list is not exhaustive), the various data points we can draw from, the voter bases that Biden needs to reach, the idiosyncrasies of this particular election environment, and the dubiousness of the importance of the VP pick, it’s difficult to extract any conclusions about who is the best strategic choice for Joe Biden. What does seem instinctively true is the heightened importance of this choice in this particular moment and the long list of highly qualified women who would bring myriad benefits to the presidential ticket. Furthermore, given the recent allegations of sexual assault against Joe Biden, all of the women on this list will have to thread the needle between supporting Biden without being perceived as being dismissive of the allegations. As Rebecca Traister outlined in her article in The Cut, any woman who accepts Biden’s invitation to be his running mate will become ensnared in this controversy. For both Biden and the potential VP nominee, there will be trade-offs. Ultimately, it’s less about who Biden chooses and more about the voters she will bring along. [1] It’s worth noting a few caveats regarding the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll. The summary data available for this poll includes preference for each candidate across various demographic groups. Survey respondents including Republican, Democratic, and third-party voters and we were unable to restrict our analysis to only Democratic voters.

clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.,"Voters say no to Biden, but Joe is intent on finishing the (awful) job","   One of Donald Trump’s gifts is that he drives his enemies so crazy that they do really weird things. The latest evidence came Tuesday morning when Joe Biden released a three-minute video announcing he is seeking re-election.  The world’s a mess, America is spiraling downward at a rapid rate and Biden would be older than dirt at the end of a second term, but he wants to “finish the job.” Finish the job? Apparently not satisfied with merely damaging America, he aims to destroy it. The fact that the president made the announcement via a recording reflects White House concerns about his stumbling and bumbling cognitive defects. He can’t hold a press conference, submit to a tough interview or speak without a teleprompter, so fire up the video with a voice-over that can be rehearsed and repeated until he gets it right.  The leader of the free world is a captive of his own decline. But as every incompetent politician knows, you don’t have to fool all the people all the time, just half of those who vote. Biden’s been using Trump’s candidacy as a rationale for his own, arguing that he alone can defeat him, and cites 2020 as proof.  Naturally, then, his tiresome references about “MAGA extremists” and a “battle for the soul of the nation” were featured in the video as fear-mongering reminders that the other side remains a danger to motherhood, apple pie and … transgender rights. It’s a clever claim that only he can beat Trump but hardly a convincing one because, as Wall Street is required to say, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  And a lot has changed since 2020, most importantly that Biden now has a terrible record of his own to defend. His approval rating of around 40% in most polls is about where Trump stood when Biden defeated him. Biden also had the COVID-era advantage of being able to spend most of the last campaign in his basement, an option not likely to be available again.  Forced to meet and greet and speak coherently while barnstorming in swing states, his ­endurance will be tested and closely watched. Yet the Trump-killer claim is always front and center because, if you strip it away, it’s next to impossible to make any other credible case for four more years.  Start with the fact that even most of Biden’s fellow Democrats ­believe it’s time for him to say goodbye.  An AP-NORC poll in February found just 37% of registered Dems want him to run again, a dramatic decline from 57% who felt that way before last year’s midterms. The AP reported that, in follow-up interviews, respondents cited his age as a liability and were “focused on his coughing, his gait, his gaffes and the possibility that the world’s most stressful job would be better suited for someone younger.” Those are awfully damning findings, and they are not outliers. While it’s true that most Dems will come home for any nominee, especially if Trump is the GOP opponent, a good argument can be made that, for the good of the country, Biden should retire gracefully and pass the torch.  Recall that in 2020, he called himself a “transition” candidate, a phrase widely interpreted as meaning he would step aside for a new generation after one term.  Mark that down as another false note. No doubt he likes the perks and power, and Biden can be forgiven if he concludes, along with the rest of the world, that Vice President Kamala Harris can’t pick up the torch. Nor is there any other obvious successor in the party.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom signaled his availability, but the response and reviews were underwhelming. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running as a primary opponent and his name guarantees him attention, but he’s not likely to be a serious threat to Biden getting the nomination.  Still, I believe there is another, hidden reason why the president is compelled to run again. He’s got to play defense against the GOP investigations into his family’s corrupt business schemes and there’s no better place to do that than in the White House.  It has armed guards and a fence around it and comes with press secretaries and cabinet members paid to answer questions and take the flak. You can always have someone say you’re too busy, even when you’re taking a nap or just eating ice cream. Biden needs all that protection because, apart from his frail health, the GOP probers already are hitting pay dirt on several fronts. Bank records they subpoenaed show at least nine members of his family getting money from the multimillion-dollar deal with a Chinese energy conglomerate.  This is the same deal in which Joe was identified as the “big guy” slated to get a secret 10% cut.  Did the president get the money? If he did, the GOP will find it. And then we’ll know for certain why he’s been so soft with China. Moreover, the emergence of an IRS whistleblower who claims that Hunter Biden is getting preferential treatment from the IRS and the Department of Justice and that Attorney General Merrick Garland lied to Congress about the case adds new degrees of legitimacy to the probe and thus peril to the president.  Then there’s the role of Secretary of State Tony Blinken, who as a Biden campaign aide in 2020 helped inspire the letter signed by 51 former intelligence officials suggesting that the first Post scoops on Hunter Biden’s laptop were a form of Russian disinformation. The letter was the actual disinformation and the fruit of a Deep State conspiracy and was dutifully magnified by a lapdog media. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update.   We also know now that Blinken met with Hunter Biden when the then-vice president’s son was on the board of Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian energy company. If Blinken is summoned by House Republicans and put under oath, he could deliver a mother lode of problems for the first family. I believe those developments, whatever Joe Biden’s preference, left him no option except to run again. They may even have dictated the timing of his announcement.  Each passing day that he didn’t announce would have led to questions about whether he was going to. And that would generate talk that he was afraid to face voters again. Not running also would have made him an instant lame duck and it would be open season on him and his family. Even congressional Dems wouldn’t have the same gusto for defending him, and the party would be concentrated on 2024 instead of defending something the Bidens did four, five or six years ago. So running is his best defense, letting him keep control of the party and the ability to reward and punish individual members of Congress. There are lots of ways for a president seeking re-election to convey a demand for support, such as, “Do you want that damaged bridge in your district repaired or not?” Merely by announcing, then, Biden buys time, keeps everybody on the left in line, including the Dem-friendly media outlets. They’re not likely to pursue the family corruption angle with any vigor if they believe it would lead to the election of Trump.  Of course, the former president’s path back to the Oval Office is not a smooth one, either. Although the partisan indictment by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is too clever by half, it’s just the start of a legal gauntlet Trump faces.  Three other criminal probes are ongoing and he faces a civil trial in federal court in New York over a claim he raped a former magazine writer nearly three decades ago. Testimony started Tuesday in the case in which the alleged victim, E. Jean Carroll, also claims Trump defamed her.  Nonetheless, the 76-year-old Trump is now stronger in the GOP than he was three months ago and there is a growing belief he will win the nomination. Several polls show him getting near 70% support, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis a distant second. That means, for now, a Biden-Trump rematch looks likely. Depending on your point of view, it’s going to be either a monumental clash of titans or a rerun of the ­retreads.

,Voters Say Those on the Other Side ‘Don’t Get’ Them. Here’s What They Want Them to Know.,"Read our research on: Immigration & Migration | Podcasts | Election 2024  In the wake of a bitterly contested presidential election, President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants to work to narrow the nation’s deep partisan divisions. It is likely to be a formidable task. Voters who supported Biden and Donald Trump say they not only differ over policies, but also have fundamental disagreements over core American values. Yet there is a sentiment with which large shares of both Biden and Trump voters agree: a feeling that those who supported the other candidate have little or no understanding of people like them. Just 2% of Biden voters – and an equally small share of Trump voters – say those who voted for the opposing candidate understand them “very well,” according to Pew Research Center’s November post-election survey. If they had the chance, what would Biden and Trump voters want those on the opposing side to know about them to understand them better? Pew Research Center asked them – and they had a lot to say. Explore a sampling of voters’ word-for-word answers, and see how some common themes emerge. Many voters responded by asserting their own political values: About a quarter of Biden voters (26%) and 32% of Trump voters wanted their counterparts to know some of the key values that are important to them. About one-in-ten Biden (12%) and Trump voters (11%) used the opportunity to tell those in the other camp not to ascribe negative stereotypes to them. These voters described in some detail how they feel mischaracterized and how the other side’s criticisms of them are flawed or inaccurate. Some voters struck themes of unity and common ground, including 13% of Biden voters and 5% of Trump supporters. They offered a perspective that Biden and Trump supporters are more alike than they are different or expressed a need for both groups to recognize each other as Americans. While some voters called for unity, larger shares (21% of Biden voters and 23% of Trump voters) criticized the opposing candidate or his supporters, often in harsh terms. This included explanations of why they are personally against Trump, Biden, or their opposing party’s behavior and policies. Two other themes worth noting were expressed by small shares of both Trump and Biden voters: 7% of Trump voters and 6% of Biden voters wrote about how they believe the other side is being misinformed. And about 3% of Biden and Trump voters took this opportunity to share personal, humanizing details about themselves. Explore more of what Biden and Trump voters want the other to know about them below.         Notes: Based on voters. Open-ended question. Open-end responses coded for multiple responses.

,Will Bernie voters vote for Biden when he wins?,"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week The establishment candidate is once again cruising to the Democratic nomination — which raises a familiar question about Bernie Sanders' insurgents One month out from the Iowa caucuses, the race for the Democratic nomination looks remarkably stable. Joe Biden is solidly in the lead, Bernie Sanders is roughly nine points behind him, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have faded, and Michael Bloomberg is blowing through wads of cash in order to stay inches ahead of Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. The dynamics of the race have been consistent at the top for more than a year now. Unless something changes soon, Biden is going to prevail. Which means that Sanders will not. And that could be a major problem for the party. Will Sanders supporters be willing (for the second time in as many presidential election cycles) to hold their noses and turn out to vote in November for a card-carrying member of the Democratic Party establishment when the socialist to whom they're so passionately devoted falls short of victory? Or will they be inclined (in much greater numbers than they did in 2016) to stay home or support someone's third-party bid from the left in a deliberate attempt to sink a party for which they have burning contempt? Those questions are going to become increasingly important as events unfold over the next few months. Subscribe for less than $2.50 per week with digital access and free home delivery. Of course, the opposite could also become a problem. If Biden sinks and Sanders somehow manages to rise above 20 percent in the polls (he hasn't been higher than that since last April) and ultimately win the nomination, the more moderate voters backing Biden will need to decide if they can stomach casting a ballot for the most left-wing candidate ever to become a major party nominee. But there is one very important difference between Biden and Sanders voters. The former are supporting the former vice president primarily because they think he is well-poised to win in a general-election contest against Trump. There's very little sign of fervent devotion to Biden as a person or a candidate. This indicates pragmatic flexibility that may be compatible with rallying behind another nominee, even if he's a socialist promising $97 trillion in new government spending. The same cannot be said for Sanders supporters, who are uncompromisingly devoted to the Vermont senator and passionately committed to undertaking what he breathlessly describes as a “political revolution.” The Atlantic's Derek Thompson is right to suggest that these millennial (and younger) voters effectively constitute a third, firmly left-wing party in American politics. This party is happy to turn out for the Democrats so long as Sanders is its nominee. But if it's bumbling, stumbling Biden — a man who served for eight years as a right-hand man to a lukewarm, moderate president after decades of representing a state (Delaware) dominated by credit card companies — well, then all bets are off. (Even if you believe polls that show a decent number of Bernie voters would shift to Biden as their second choice, this would still leave an awful lot of unhappy and homeless Sanders supporters around to stir up trouble.) It would be one thing if 2016 had never happened. But it did, and many of Bernie's supporters feel like they got burned badly by the Democratic establishment not once but twice four years ago. First, their hopes were raised by Sanders' surprising success across the country and then dashed by his inability to overcome Hillary Clinton's strong institutional support. Then they settled for Clinton as a consolation prize in order to defeat Donald Trump in the general election only to have her lose to him. As far as they're concerned, they've been fooled two times already. It's passion that explains Sanders' incredible success at fundraising — with $34.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, a number that is likely to dwarf everyone else's in the race. It's even more impressive when we factor in the Sanders campaign's emphasis on collecting small donations. That shows a lot of devotion by a lot of people. So far there's no sign that it's enough people to win the race for the nomination. But it would be more than enough to torpedo Democrats' chances of taking down Trump in November. Will Sanders (an independent who only calls himself a Democrat when he's running for president) urge his supporters once again to back the Democratic nominee, even if it's Biden? And even if he does, will those supporters go along with such an unrevolutionary act of sail-trimming? That would be the real test of whether Sanders is leading a cult of his own personality or a genuine, ideologically galvanized movement that will outlast his leadership and continue to influence the shape of American politics going forward. A movement firmly committed to bringing about the scale of changes Sanders has been advocating wouldn't hesitate to “heighten the contradictions” — that is, allow things to get worse in the short term (by acting in a way that helps Trump to win a second term) in the hope that better long-term prospects for progress (namely, a big shift to the left in the electorate) would emerge from the mess. If nothing else, a second loss to Trump would ensure the overthrow of the establishment that has led the Democratic Party since 1992, thereby opening up the prospect of its takeover by left-wing populists by 2024. As I've pointed out before, the Democratic electoral coalition is extremely broad, and perhaps too broad for its own good. A party that's big enough to include everyone from socialist Bernie Sanders to liberal Republican Michael Bloomberg is a party that will struggle to find a single standard-bearer who can unite its disparate factions. It might even be a party poised to shatter into its constituent parts. The Sanders campaign may well end up being the catalyst that prompts the detonation.

,"Young Black Americans not sold on Biden, the Democrats or voting","Photo by Hill Street Studios/Getty Images. Most political analysts define “swing voters” as those who swing their support from one party to the other between election cycles – determining winners and losers in the process. According to this conventional wisdom, the “swingiest” voters are working-class whites in the Midwest, who supposedly hold the keys to the White House. Meanwhile, by contrast, pundits often portray Black Americans as an undifferentiated mass – loyal Democrat-supporting foot soldiers who will execute their mission for The Team on Tuesday as long as some preacher provides the right marching orders on Sunday. If these depictions have not already expired, they are certainly growing stale. Having studied electoral trends for decades, we can tell you that those undecided voters of the past are an endangered species – in the Midwest and elsewhere. These days, the only choice that most Americans make – indeed, the choice that typically “swings” the election outcome — is whether to vote at all. That brings us to the characterization of Black Americans as Democratic loyalists. Our new survey of 1,215 African Americans in battleground states – Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia – reveals that while those over 60 remain among the most reliable of Democratic voters, and those between 40-59 are still pretty locked in as well, those under 30 (whom we oversampled to comprise half of our sample) are anything but. Only 47% of those Black Americans under 30 years old that we surveyed plan to vote for the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden. That’s roughly the same percentage who have anything positive to say when asked what “one or two words come to mind” about the former vice president. Cathy Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who studies Black youths’ political views, summed up this attitude in a recent podcast: “They’ve seen the election of Black mayors, they’ve seen the election of the first Black president, and they’ve also seen that their lives have not changed.”  These young Black Americans may well sit things out in November, just as many of them did in 2016 when their behavior swung that election to Trump as much as anything else did. In our poll, 31% of Black Americans under 30 say they probably won’t vote in this election. That may sound pretty good, given the average U.S. voter turnout of around 60% in recent elections. But survey respondents of all stripes tend to wildly overestimate their intention to vote. Indeed, about half of our Black survey respondents under 30 say they don’t often vote because it “doesn’t make a difference,” providing a somewhat more realistic estimate of the percentage who will probably just stay home – and not search for a stamp to mail in their ballot, either. And that number does not even take into account the turnout-depressing effects of voter suppression efforts taking place across the country, the pandemic or the heavy distrust of mail-in voting that young Black people tend to express. Only 64% of young people in our sample say they trust the state to report their vote accurately, and only 30% say they plan to take advantage of mail-in voting. Such cynicism on the part of young Black Americans is reflected in the lukewarm feelings they tend to have toward the Democratic Party more generally. Only 47% of them say that the party is welcoming to Black Americans, and only 43% say they trust Democrats in Congress to do what’s best for the Black community. Perhaps most strikingly, unlike their older counterparts, only half of those under 30 view the Democrats as any better than the Republicans on these scores. In both the survey responses and in the focus groups we conducted of young Black Americans in these same states, we heard repeated frustration toward what they view as a Democratic Party that expects their vote but doesn’t really do anything to deserve it other than claim to be “less racist” than the alternative. As one of our focus group respondents put it, “I think at the end of the day, they all have the same agenda.” In short, it appears that for Black America, the future is not necessarily “blue.” Electorally speaking, it is not necessarily anything at all. Moving forward, young Black Americans may be the real “swing voters” in the only way that term really makes much sense anymore. David C.

,"WTF... seriously? Who in their right mind would vote for the Orange Gas Bag over Joe Biden? I honestly cannot see young people voting for Trump. They need to stop polling old, white, angry republicans and actually poll the younger generation. You'll get vastly different results."," These polls are riddled with errors and bias, deliberately. Ignore them and vote for the right person is what we all should do. Look at historical polls one year out from Election Day, they are rarely predictive of the result. Polls right now are just filling airtime for the talking heads. The poll is accurate for what it measured, it did not measure likely voters. That's a small subset of total eligible voters. Ignore the polls, vote, help other people to vote, check your voter registration, get involved in a campaign I wish I could upvote this twice. We should all be reminding people of this at every turn. People need to think about a few things: A) we need to vote, we need young people to vote. GOP knows they cannot win the more people actually vote which is why they lost their mind when Taylor Swift asked people to vote WITHOUT MENTIONING A PARTY. It is why they’re trying to raise the age for voting, purging voter polls and trying to suppress votes through ID laws and reducing polling locations B) reporting like this is supposed to disenfranchise you; make you feel like it is already fate and there is no point in voting C) the media is so click driven and sensationalist that they WANT Trump to win. How many of us increased News consumption during his presidency?? How many of you reduced it post-Biden? Draw your own conclusions, but these facts should be considered. VOTE LIKE DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON IT. Vote.gov Know about Project 2025 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_2025 I am a teacher and there are definitely trump loving young people I had younger “friends” in 2016 who were pro-Trump because they thought it was hilarious how triggered and upset people got about him—real meme kids. After a little while the ones who didn’t come around (“Whoa wait this is really bad for my gay friends”) outed themselves as just really enjoying being obnoxious and “debating” people. They loved being assholes. They’re former friends now. I hope they’ve made a turnaround but my energy isn’t tied into theirs anymore. Polling was done over landlines and in person at insane asylums. May explain results Seriously. Trump has: 91 indictments against him As recently as Friday has been ruled by a judge to have actively participated and incited the insurrection on Jan 6th. Been convicted of sexual assault. Stole classified government secrets and showed them off like a 6-year-old showing off their macaroni art. Caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans during the pandemic. Kissed the collective asses of Xi Jin Ping, Kim Jong Un, Viktor Orban and Vladimir Putin Called fallen US military personnel ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Wants to put immigrants into concentration camps. Wants to throw out the constitution. Got Roe v. Wade overturned. Tried to destroy NATO. Wants to ban Muslims from entering the US. Crashed the US economy and tacked on over 7 trillion dollars to the national debt. Alienated the US's allies. Almost got the country into a war with Iran. But somehow, some way, the people of this country think he's a better choice over Joe Biden because Biden is, what, old? TRUMP IS OLD! He's 77! That isn't young! He can't even remember who IS president right now and keeps thinking he's running against Obama! During his presidency they had to distract Trump with colorful pictures to keep him from screwing up even more than he already did! I swear, it's like the media WANTS that monster to win again so they can report on his insanity, but they fail to realize he's going to come after them and shut them all down except for Fox and Newsmax. I mean, are they that blinded by greed that they're willing to destroy this country absolutely for better ratings?! I would say ""oh my god"", but all of this, this is solid proof there is NO GOD. The media does want him to win. His little daily Hitler speeches draw the views and ratings. The media knows if he loses this time it's over. He's not gonna last another 4 years to make another run, so they lose thier ratings monster and might have to go back to reporting actual fucking news                          ",https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/17z05k1/wtf_seriously_who_in_their_right_mind_would_vote/,
,Letters to President Obama,"Jump to main content Jump to navigation 3/24/10 Dear Mr. President. I am writing you this letter in concern for the economy, my family, and my home. I am a 35 year old mother of 1 little boy who is 5. I have a concern that I need you to hear from an average family trying to make it through these hard times. I do not expect that anything will be done, but I do want you to hear how we are struggling. I was laid off in June from a job that I was at for 8 years making a pretty substantial salary. My husband, who was an electrician, has been laid off since September of 2008. He was called back to work in July 2009 but only worked for about 2 months before his company laid him off again and he has been out of work ever since. I was only able to land myself a temporary job that my new boss is struggling to make permanent. We do not have any insurance for our son and we are living off of my salary which is about 10K less a year and unemployment. We struggle living week to week to pay our mortgage- which was underwritten to a smaller amount so that we do not have to let our house go into foreclosure. I want you to have a good idea of the history of events that have occurred with our bank and credit. We refinanced our mortgage in 2006 thinking we could get a leg up on some of our credit card bills and also invest more money into our home. When we refinanced with our bank they did not set up an escrow account - which they did not tell us. When we figured it out - they basically told us it was too late. So that said, we have been struggling to pay our taxes but we have taken out a 401K my husband had and we paid our taxes through July of last year. We have had some hard times through our marriage which ended up costing us more in credit card debt. We have now reconciled and are also struggling to pay that as well. We have received letters through the mail that say that this is part of your plan to help America reduce their debt so we signed a contract with a company that pay every month which should in the end reduce the overall payment of our credit cards for a settlement. Since we have done that we have received numerous creditor calls and letters, and judgments against us- which has completely ruined our credit overall so far. We have no future, only weekly income! So now, it's tax time. Since we were both laid off for a good amount of time in 2009 and that my husband was laid off for the majority of 2009 we now owe in taxes- on top of the taxes that we already owe. I ask you - how we are supposed to pay that? How do you expect anyone that has been laid off to pay any of their taxes when there are no jobs to help alleviate that? Why do you offer to take taxes out when someone applies for unemployment? Being used to a cost of living expense and having to even reduce that to an unemployment paycheck you want to receive as much money as you are eligible for to make up for the money you are used to receiving. Just put yourself in our shoes? Everyone I know who voted for you is now turning the other direction, but I have faith in you and that you will do what you can to turn this around, in the meantime I am struggling with the fact that we may need to just walk away from our home to alleviate the stress of paying for this home and on top of that I am trying to go back to school online to better myself and hopefully in the long run better my family. My son is the one who is receiving the short end of the stick here as it has been stressful on him as well. We end up taking it out on him or he just wants to make things better for us by spending his time making money out of paper and giving it to us. Thinking it will help.... HE's FIVE years old!!! I have seen you in office for over a year now and I want to know what you can do to help us- the average family just trying to get back on our feet, live our lives like Americans should and not have to feel like we are constantly struggling. You say you read these - at least 10 a day- and I am sure there are other families struggling just the same if not worse, but how are you going to help us??? Wall street executives walk away with high pay outs on their investments or receive bonus checks for the work they have performed, most of them are snyde corporate executives who have helped put the economy where it is at today.... but what about the people who are doing the work for them?? ? We end up getting the struggle. We are the ones who will end up homeless and we are the ones who you talk about when you say AMERICA is struggling and we have not seen any relief except that you can continue to collect for another 13 weeks only to pay for it in the end... with the taxes you require us to pay back... WHY would you make those who are unemployed because of this melt down have to pay back? We did not ask for this in the first place. I wonder where we can find the money to give millions away in lotto but no money for the economy?? This is just something I do not get. I'm an upset American who is losing faith in you... I do not want to lose that faith.. When I voted for you, I really was inspired that you will make the changes to help us- the average middle class- but all I see is that upper class walking away feeling ok... while we continue to struggle. It's not fair... The honest middle class are sitting back struggling... it's just not fair... We never asked for this!! I don't expect anything from this letter... just put yourself in my shoes... Every day I'm watching my family fall apart and also worried about potentially losing my home... all because we of what we know... Yes, the economy is bad... yea yea yea... This is heartbreaking!!!   Sincerely, [Anonymous] Windsor Locks, CT Dear [Anonymous] — I received you letter, and know that this has been a very difficult time for you and families across America. You need to know that all the steps I have taken have been designed to stabilize the economy and help folks get back on their feet. For example, unemployment benefits are traditionally fully taxed but because of the Recovery, we actually reduced the taxes you had to pay. I know that’s little consolation when times are so tough. But it’s an example of the kinds of measures — just like making COBRA more affordable so people losing their jobs can keep their health care — that I’ve been fighting for. I wish you and your family all the best, and will keep you in my thoughts and prayers as long as I’m in the White House.

"Day 2 of Trump's presidency, she concluded she'd made a mistake. ",Polls say Trump is in danger. These shifting voters are the reason why,"These are some of the most powerful voters in the world. If the polls are to be believed, and we'll soon discover if they are, they're the people who would end Donald Trump's presidency. Meet America's shifting voters. They are a small slice of the electorate with colossal influence, not only on U.S. politics but on their country's relationship with the world. They tend to lack enthusiasm for either major party and fall into several categories — swing voters, centrists and moderates; first-time voters; people who vote for third parties; and people who sometimes don't vote at all. And they spell trouble for Trump. Surveys in advance of the Nov. 3 U.S. election find the president bleeding support from the kinds of voters who change their mind from one election to the next. Peg Bohnert is one of them.  The Arizona retiree describes herself as an independent who leans Republican. She voted for Trump in 2016, figuring she'd give him a chance, in the hope the federal government might run more efficiently under a businessman. It happened when the first White House press briefing of the Trump era was dedicated to arguing about the size of his inauguration crowd. The subsequent four years have only cemented her antipathy toward him. ""I trusted [Trump]. I no longer trust him, and I won't trust him again. Because he lies,"" Bohnert said.   ""No moral compass. No empathy. No kindness."" She said she's shy nowadays when she travels to even identify as an American: ""He's made us look like fools — as a country."" A major reason Trump won in 2016 was support from the so-called double-haters — people who disliked both him and Hillary Clinton. Che Eng is one of them. He reluctantly cast his ballot for Trump in 2016. ""I despised Hillary [Clinton],"" said the Arizona medical doctor. ""Trump was an outsider. I gave him a chance."" He's disdainful of both major parties, seeing them as irresponsible, with Democrats too far left and Republicans too far right. His breaking point with Trump came in late 2017. He worried about federal analysis showing a growing national debt because of a tax-cut bill Trump signed. While he's no big fan of Joe Biden, either, Eng voted for him a few days ago. ""It pains me,"" Eng said of voting Democrat.  He's so worried about his Republican friends finding out, he asked that his first name not be used in this story and that ""Che,"" a variation on his middle name, be used instead.  Arlene Macellaro was another voter uninspired by her options in 2016.  She's a longtime Republican and former health-care administrator living in Florida's massive Villages retirement community. She nearly cast a ballot for Clinton in 2016 — but got cold feet.  WATCH | Why this Republican is voting for Joe Biden:  Macellaro opted not to vote at all. She was scared off by the scandal over Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When the FBI announced two weeks before election day 2016 that it was reopening an investigation into Clinton, Macellaro decided to stay home rather than help elect a president who might immediately face criminal indictment. She's all in for Biden now.  ""Someone asked me yesterday, 'How does it make you feel when you think that your vote, if it's for Joe Biden, could change the complexion and feel of your Republican Party?'"" Macellaro said in an interview. ""My answer is, 'I feel good about it because I feel that it gives us hope to believe in the America that I grew up in.'"" The people quoted so far in this story share a few attributes common to the groups of voters turning most aggressively against Trump. All live in suburbs, they don't have the strongest partisan affiliation, two are women, and they are seniors or, in the case of 62-year-old Eng, close to retirement. Polls say the president is bleeding votes across those groups and others — including college-educated and non-college-educated white voters. Yasser Sanchez is a Latino, a Mormon and a lawyer in Arizona. Until recently, he was also a committed Republican — one who actively campaigned for past presidential nominees John McCain and Mitt Romney. ""I never saw a day where I would [support the Democrats],"" Sanchez said. ""[Then] Donald Trump happened. … Donald Trump happened to the Republican Party. … Not only will I be voting Joe Biden — I will be campaigning actively to get out the vote for Joe Biden."" Sanchez describes Trump as an autocrat-in-the-making, an existential threat to American democracy, and he calls this the most important election since the Civil War. WATCH | Why this Republican is campaigning for Joe Biden in Arizona: Meanwhile, young people keep entering the pool of eligible voters. And they favour Democrats by a huge margin. A big question mark is whether they'll turn out this year, given their lacklustre support for Biden in his party primaries. Some early indications suggest they are, indeed, voting in greater numbers than in 2016, when lower turnout among young and minority voters hurt Clinton in key swing states. Nineteen-year-old TeJean Neal just cast his first-ever presidential election ballot in swing-state Wisconsin. The Milwaukee university student dislikes both candidates: he derides Biden as a neoliberal, old-school, pro-business politician. But he's voted for him anyway, in order to oust a president he calls far more dangerous: he calls Trump a budding fascist, whose policies disproportionately hurt minority and marginalized people. ""It's not an enthusiastic vote. It's an I-have-privilege vote,"" said Neal, a student of film and African-diaspora studies at the University of Wisconsin.   ""There are more people who would be hurt by the fascist than the neoliberal."" He said he intends to protest a Biden administration from Day 1, on issues from police reform to transitioning from fossil fuels. But the immediate objective, he said, is beating Trump. Mateo Gomez has also just entered the eligible-voting pool. He arrived in the U.S. as a toddler from Colombia; he's now a 22-year-old MBA student in Florida.  Gomez said he agonized over his vote, his first chance to cast a ballot since obtaining U.S. citizenship.  Unlike Neal, he sees himself as a centrist. He has participated in town halls with politicians of both parties (including one with Biden) and sees himself as a bit of a peacemaker when his family and friends argue about politics. Gomez said he considered voting for Trump right up to the last minute – but wound up casting an early ballot for Biden.  The reason? He blamed Republican efforts to end the Obamacare health-insurance system, which his family relies on; he said he also wants better pay for teachers, and more action on climate change.  Gomez lives just north of Miami, one of the places in the U.S. most threatened by flooding and extreme weather. ""I try to see both sides. I try to avoid the drama,"" he said. Gomez notes, however, that many fellow Latinos will vote for Trump in this state — which is critical to the president's re-election. Trump has especially actively courted Cubans, and Venezuelans, who come from nations marked by left-wing authoritarianism. They're being bombarded with warnings that Democrats will usher in socialism, as well as some downright bizarre conspiracy theories. That speaks to a contrast in this election. While polls suggest Trump is losing support from most demographic segments, he's gained some ground with minority voters — performing as well as, or even better, than he did in 2016. He's still trailing significantly among those groups. But some surveys suggest he may be slightly reducing the Democrats' margin with Black men and Hispanic voters. Cuban-born Miriam Weiss said the enthusiasm for Trump is evident in caravans you see in Miami on weekends, consisting of thousands of cars, waving Trump flags. She's been supporting Republicans since John F. Kennedy's failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, months after she immigrated to the U.S. But she predicted more Cubans would support Republicans than usual — in the fear that socialism is taking over the Democratic Party, and that Biden won't stop it. ""If people vote for Biden we will be getting communism here within two years,"" Weiss said. Those attitudes aren't limited to Florida, or to Cuban-Americans.  A recent Pew survey estimated Trump's deficit with Hispanic voters is narrower in nine swing states than nationwide. Sylvia Menchaca is one such Trump supporter. She's a religious conservative, and entrepreneur who runs a Mexican restaurant in Arizona. She said she feels sorry for migrant children separated from their parents under Trump's border policy.  But she said the president has a responsibility to protect the border. In fact, she compared Trump to a biblical king — a flawed man, with a divine mission to protect his country. WATCH | Cuba-born Republican on why she's sticking with Donald Trump: And she thinks all those polls we're looking at will soon reveal themselves to be absolute junk. ""You think Biden's leading. You all think Biden's leading,"" Menchaca told a reporter in an interview.  ""It's so funny. ... But it's okay. [Trump's] going to win.""

,The 2020 Election by the Numbers,"                  It’s almost over. Yesterday Electoral College electors convened virtually or in person in state capitals across the country to cast their votes. The result was what everyone expected, the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States. With the election now essentially settled—Republican lawmakers may make one last doomed attempt to reverse the results when Congress meets on January 6 to confirm the Electoral College vote—here’s one last review of how the vote went. The Electoral College More on: Elections and Voting United States 2020 in Review Transition 2021 Joe Biden In 2016, seven electors declined to vote for the candidate they were pledged to. That was the highest number of “faithless electors” ever, with the exception of the election of 1872. That year sixty-three electors broke their pledge. They had a good reason to do so, however. They were pledged to Democratic candidate Horace Greeley—he of “Go West” fame. Greeley died three weeks after losing to Ulysses S. Grant and before the Electoral College met. His pledged electors were understandably reluctant to vote for a dead man. Three electors, however, did cast their votes for Greeley.  This year there were no faithless electors. So the final tally in the Electoral College was 306 to 232. That, of course, is the reverse of the margin Donald Trump won by in 2016. He called that a “massive landslide victory.” Biden flipped five states on his way to winning the Electoral College: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Every other state held to form. The Popular Vote Biden won 81,283,098 votes, or 51.3 percent of the votes cast. He is the first U.S. presidential candidate to have won more than 80 million votes. Trump won 74,222,958 votes, or 46.8 percent of the votes cast. That’s more votes than any other presidential candidate has ever won, with the exception of Biden. (Third-party candidates picked up 1.8 percent of the votes cast.) More than 159 million Americans voted in 2020: 159,633,396 to be exact. That’s the largest total voter turnout in U.S. history and the first time more than 140 million people voted. Voter turnout in 2020 was the highest in 120 years when measured as a percentage of the voting-eligible population: 66.7 percent. You have to go back all the way to 1900 to find a higher percentage turnout (73.7 percent). The election of 1876 holds the record for highest turnout: 82.6 percent. That, of course, was also one of America’s most controversial and consequential elections—and not in a good way.         Minnesota holds pride of place with the highest state voter turnout. Eighty percent of Minnesotans went to the polls. Oklahoma holds the dubious distinction of being the state with the lowest voter turnout. Just 55 percent of Oklahomans voted. A Close Election or Not?   So did Biden win comfortably? Yes, if you go by the popular vote. In the past six presidential elections, only Barack Obama in 2008 won by a larger total vote margin than the 7,060,140-vote margin that Biden piled up. Likewise, Biden’s 4.5 percentage point lead is the largest win in the past six elections other than Obama’s seven-point win in 2008. But as Andrew Jackson, Samuel Tilden, Grover Cleveland, Al Gore, and Hillary Clinton can all attest, winning the popular vote doesn’t necessarily mean winning the presidency. When you look at the smallest popular vote shift needed to give Trump a victory, the 2020 election was close. Indeed, it was even closer than 2016. If Trump picked up the right mix of 42,921 votes in Arizona (10,457), Georgia (11,779), and Wisconsin (20,682), the Electoral College would have been tied at 269 all. The House would have then decided the election. Republicans will hold the majority of state delegations in the new Congress, and they undoubtedly would have chosen Trump. If Trump had also picked up the one electoral vote in Nebraska’s Second Congressional District, which he lost to Biden by 22,091 votes, he would have won the Electoral College outright. Back in 2016, Clinton needed to pick up the right mix of 78,000 votes in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to win the Electoral College. Women in Congress The 117th Congress will have a record total 141 women, or 26.4 percent of its membership, when it convenes on January 3. (Even so, women’s representation in Congress will lag behind that in the national legislatures of many other democratic countries.) Those numbers don’t include Senator Kamala Harris, who will be resigning her seat, or non-voting delegates in the House. These numbers could change slightly or remain the same, depending on whether Kelly Loeffler wins the January 5 run-off for her Georgia Senate seat and who is appointed to fill Vice-President-Elect Harris’s Senate seat. Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge is set to resign her seat so she can become secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Women won’t, however, be equally distributed between the two parties. Democrats will have 105 women members of Congress, which is one less than in the 116th Congress. Republicans will have thirty-six women lawmakers, or fourteen more than in the 116th Congress. That breaks the record the GOP set back in 2006. The House will have 117 women lawmakers, with eighty-nine Democrats and twenty-eight Republicans. Nine out of the thirteen House seats Republicans flipped from blue to red were won by women. Meanwhile, there will be twenty-four women senators, sixteen of whom are Democrats and eight of whom are Republicans. Again, how Loeffler fares on January 5 and who replaces Harris and Fudge could change these numbers. A record fifty-one women of color will serve in the 117th Congress. The previous record was forty-eight, set by the 116th Congress. Republicans broke their record for most women of color in Congress (five). The previous GOP record was three, set in 2014. Forty-six women of color will represent Democrats (not including Kamala Harris), down from the record forty-seven from the last Congress. Cori Bush (D-MO) became the first Black congresswoman elected in Missouri and Marilyn Strickland (D-WA) the first in the state of Washington. Strickland also joins Young Kim (R-CA) and Michelle Steel (R-CA) to become the first Korean American women in Congress. Wyoming elected its first female Senator: Republican Cynthia Lummis.   Other Notable Developments People of color will make up about 28 percent of the new House. Elected to the House this year, not including non-voting delegates, are forty-three Hispanic Americans (three more than the 116th Congress); sixteen Asian Americans (three more than the 116th); fifty-seven Black Americans (five more than the 116th); and five American Indians (two more than the 116th), and one native Hawaiian, Kaiali’i Kahele. Kahele is only the second native Hawaiian elected since Hawaii became a state in 1959. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM) is the only Hispanic member of the Senate’s incoming freshman class. Once he is sworn in, the Senate will have five Latinx members, with the others being Democrats Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Republicans Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida. The Senate will have two Black members after Harris resigns, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina. That number could go higher depending on whether Raphael Warnock wins his race in Georgia and on who is chosen to succeed Harris as California’s junior senator. The Senate will continue to have two senators of Asian descent, Democrats Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) and Ritchie Torres (D-NY) became the first openly gay Black men elected to Congress. The addition of Jones and Torres means that a record number of eleven LGBTQ+ lawmakers will be in the 117th Congress.   Morgan Cawthorn (R-NC) became the youngest person elected to the House in modern history. He is twenty-five years old. The pandemic helped popularize early voting and mail-in ballots. Americans cast 101,453,111 early votes. That is 64.1 percent of the total votes cast in 2020. The total number of mail-in ballots was 65,642,049. Looking Ahead The 2022 congressional midterm elections will be held on November 8, 2022. That is 693 days away. All 435 House seats and thirty-four Senate seats will be up for grabs. The 2024 election will be held on November 5, 2024. That’s 1,421 days away. Margaret Gach assisted in the preparation of this post.    ",https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers,

Alex Samuels,Biden Is Running For Reelection. What Are His Chances For 2024?,"2024 ELECTION APR. 25, 2023, AT 7:37 AM PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER / GETTY IMAGES After months of prognosticating and tons of built-up anticipation, the day is finally upon us: President Biden has announced that he’s seeking a second term in 2024. The announcement comes after months of teasing from the Biden administration — first it was supposed to happen somewhere around Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Then “not long after” February’s State of the Union. Then in the beginning of April. But in the end, today’s announcement was mostly unsurprising because most presidents seek reelection, and they often win when they go for it. That said, in polls fielded throughout Biden’s first few years in office, many Democratic voters said they’re ready to move on from him, a sentiment almost certainly spurred by concerns about Biden’s age (he’s 80 now, and he’d be almost 82 on Election Day) and his low approval ratings. The problem, of course, is that an obvious alternative to Biden hasn’t surfaced. And in some ways, it will be easy for him to make the case that he’s been a successful president who deserves another four years in office. But the worries that made his own base ambivalent about a second Biden term are likely to haunt his candidacy, too.   So let’s walk through Biden’s first two(ish) years in the White House — the good, the bad and the ugly — and take a look at his odds in both the primary and the general election.  Perhaps no measure better captures the good, the bad and the ugly of Biden’s presidency than his approval rating. Americans were relatively high on Biden when he was elected, but that didn’t last long. He came into office with a 53 percent approval rating and 36 percent disapproval rating, according to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, and it wasn’t hard to understand why: Americans were largely unhappy with former President Donald Trump. Just a few months after his inauguration, Biden signed into law the widely popular American Rescue Plan, a sweeping aid package that included help to states to help combat the coronavirus pandemic and $1,400 direct payments to certain Americans. But goodwill is fragile in an increasingly polarized political environment, and Americans started to sour on Biden after only a few months. Starting in August 2021, his approval rating dropped precipitously and his disapproval rating rose sharply. It was a kind of presidential perfect storm: the delta variant of the coronavirus was surging, the economic fallout from the pandemic was starting to come into focus and the administration’s bungled response to withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan was making headlines. Later that winter, it also became more clear that major parts of Biden’s election platform — like passing bills to protect voting rights and to reform policing — were doomed, and Biden’s omnibus Build Back Better Act suffered a setback after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin refused to back an early version with a multi-trillion dollar price tag, citing concerns about how it would affect inflation.  As the chart above shows,1
Biden never quite recovered. In fact, since that first summer of his presidency, Biden’s approval has consistently remained underwater. But there’s not necessarily one policy failure that explains this trend, William Howell, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told me. In fact, one feature of American politics is that presidential approval ratings almost always drop over time. “I think that we tend to over-interpret the significance of individual events or perceived gaffes,” Howell said. “But when the euphoria of a campaign or the fresh gloss of a new candidate wears off and you get into the drudgery of actually governing, approval ratings routinely decline. And that’s what we’ve seen here.”  RECOMMENDED POLITICS The Second GOP Debate Could Be Smaller, With Or Without Trump Read Now     One challenge for Biden is that his presidency has arguably been quite successful — his wins just haven’t been enough to save his approval rating. Despite only barely having majority support in the U.S. Senate for all of his time in office so far, the post-honeymoon phase of Biden’s presidency was surprisingly productive: He was able to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a bipartisan infrastructure bill and another bipartisan gun-safety bill. In addition, almost half of Americans gave the Biden administration decently high marks for its initial handling of Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine. The president also received praise after he announced a popular plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debt (though that’s currently tangled up with the Supreme Court).  But none of those victories really helped Biden in the court of public opinion. Even Democrats’ strong performance in last year’s midterm races failed to move the needle for him, and now that Republicans control the U.S. House, it’s unlikely that Biden will be able to usher through meaty legislative priorities. Compared to past presidents, though, Biden actually starts his reelection bid as somewhat of an underdog. In fact, as of April 24, only 42.5 percent of Americans approved of his job as president. That’s actually not far off from Trump (41.3 percent) and former President Barack Obama’s (45.1 percent) approval numbers on April 24 the year before they sought reelection. But, perhaps worryingly for Biden, he’s still on lower end compared to recent presidents. The approval ratings of recent presidents who sought reelection on April 24 the year before an election and on Election Day Gerald Ford is not included because there is no available public polling on his job approval from July through November 1976. SOURCE: POLLS Of course, having an underwater approval rating doesn’t mean Biden’s reelection campaign is doomed. Given the polarized nature of our current politics, all future presidents — not just Biden — will likely suffer lower approval ratings “absent a really good economy,” said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Without that, Bowman told me, “it’s hard to foresee a president moving their ratings up significantly.” What’s working against Biden, though, is that the economy has never been an area of immense strength for him: According to an the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey from mid-March, just 31 percent of adults overall said that they approve of Biden’s stewardship of the national economy, which is consistent with past surveys. Yet even with lackluster marks on the economy, there was no reason to expect Biden would throw in the towel after just one term. As I mentioned before, both Biden — and his wife, Jill — have long teased today’s announcement (which probably helped keep any notable primary challengers at bay — sorry Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson)! But even though Biden may be Democrats’ most viable option at this point, that doesn’t mean his party’s voters are over the moon about today’s announcement.  That ennui might be unavoidable for Biden, because a number of polls and reports suggest that Democrats’ biggest issue with Biden isn’t his performance in office — it’s his age. Biden was the oldest living president the day he was sworn into office, and according to a USA Today/Suffolk Poll from mid-April, a plurality of 2020 Biden voters (42 percent) said that his age makes them less likely to support him. What might work in Biden’s favor, though, at least in a primary, is that 55 percent of his voters said his age didn’t make a difference to them. Meanwhile, a second survey from CNN/SSRS conducted in March found that two-thirds of adults felt as though Biden doesn’t have the stamina and sharpness to serve effectively. And there are also real concerns that he’s not a particularly motivating figure, even if Democrats probably prefer him to a Republican alternative. That CNN/SSRS survey found that a majority of respondents thought that Biden does not inspire confidence (65 percent) and does not care about people like them (54 percent). These numbers, of course, could present an opening for someone on Biden’s left flank to announce a challenge to his candidacy, but surveys show that some of the potential Democratic candidates polling best against Biden currently are in his administration: Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. So barring a major collapse in Biden’s standing, a serious primary challenger at this point appears very unlikely. Plus, in a February Yahoo News/YouGov survey, almost half (47 percent) of registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning independent voters said they’d renominate Biden for president versus “someone else” (34 percent). And, fact is, elected presidents rarely face serious opposition for renomination. More importantly, Biden has a solid standing on a number of policy issues — at least among his base. That USA Today survey found that 70 percent of Biden voters (including 73 percent of self-identified liberals, 78 percent of moderates and 65 percent of conservatives) are largely in favor of the president’s positions and policies. Moreover, a second poll from The Economist/YouGov fielded in late March found Democratic adults overwhelmingly approved of Biden’s handling of the economy (72 percent), foreign policy (72 percent), immigration (64 percent), crime (60 percent) and inflation (59 percent). So while voters may not be jumping for joy about  another four years under Biden, the poll seems to suggest that most also don’t mind how he’s currently governing.  “Elections operate like Wall Street: fear and greed. And while Biden’s age may tamper the greed, the prospects of a Donald Trump winning the presidency again is enough to raise the fear levels,” said Allan Lichtman, the author of “Predicting the Next President: The Keys to the White House,” which is now in seven editions, and a history professor at American University. “There’s no way Democrats are not going to coalesce around Joe Biden, even if Ron DeSantis is the nominee.” All that’s to say that despite their misgivings about his age, Democrats will still likely vote for Biden in a primary. But what about his odds in a general election? Voters currently say that they don’t want a redux of the 2020 election — but they might get one anyway. Biden and Trump, who is currently leading the Republican primary field, are currently favored to win their respective party’s nominations. And according to Lichtman, Biden’s run for a second term already gives Democrats an edge in 2024 since they avoid both an internal party battle and have the power of incumbency on their side.  But that doesn’t mean Biden will skate into a second term unscathed — far from it. In fact, there’s plenty of reason to believe that Biden’s age could be a liability in a general election, especially if he faces someone like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (currently polling second after Trump in FiveThirtyEight’s 2024 Republican primary polling average) who, at 44, is just over half Biden’s age, making for an easy generational contrast. And the imperfect, hypothetical head-to-head polling we have for the 2024 general election suggest that Biden would face an uphill climb against both Trump and DeSantis. A Wall Street Journal poll fielded in mid-to-late April, for instance, found Biden (45 percent) trailing DeSantis (48 percent) among registered voters in a hypothetical head-to-head contest, while the president narrowly led Trump by just 3 percentage points. (Both leads, however, were within the poll’s margin of error). This lines up with past polling, which also suggested that Biden would be essentially tied with both men. Howell pointed out there are a number of reasons that we could be heading for a tight race in 2024. “So there’s the issue of his age, but the big question will be what the state of the economy and the inflation rate is,” he said. “And if that war in Ukraine is still dragging on come the election, we can expect Biden’s Republican opponent to raise all kinds of questions about why we were dragged into this and where it’s going. I think those are the big things to watch out for.” But, again, early head-to-head polling here is imperfect and certainly subject to change, especially as the GOP primary field settles — after all, DeSantis isn’t even formally in the game. Regardless of what the surveys say, though, we live in a very evenly divided country and every presidential election these days is close, so we — and Biden — should be prepared for a very competitive race.

,Can Joe Biden Intervene in a House Speaker Vote As President?,"As the chaos that has embroiled the House Republican Caucus entered its third day Thursday, President Joe Biden's White House has already made one thing clear: that the disfunction in the House was Republicans' mess to clean up, and theirs alone. ""We're certainly not going to insert ourselves in what's happening on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters earlier this week. ""He was a senator, he understands how this process works, and he's just not going to insert himself, he's going to let the process play out and continue to do the work of the American people,"" she added. Procedurally, there's nothing Biden can do, per the House rules. That framework dictates that the process of deciding who leads their conference is solely up to its members, who have so far failed to give any single candidate the plurality they need to become Speaker of the House in almost one-dozen consecutive votes. Entering the fourth day of votes for Speaker of the House Friday, some wondered if there was an imperative for him to act. The House of Representatives cannot consider or pass legislation until a speaker is seated, and, currently, there appears to be little indication the far-right House Freedom Caucus—which has so far refused to support leading Republican Kevin McCarthy's bid for the post—plans to yield any time soon. Truthfully, there's little incentive for Biden to do anything: the Republican Party comes into the 118th Congress with a majority, which top Republican Kevin McCarthy has pledged to wield to obstruct numerous facets of the Biden administration's agenda. He has also pledged to lead myriad investigations into a number of cabinet-level officials like FBI director Christopher Wray and Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas, whom Republicans have targeted as the central figure in the Biden administration's perceived failures at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even conservatives admit that there is really no rush to seat a speaker of the house anytime soon. ""The stakes for the Speakership of the House are incredibly low at this point because all the leader of the House, basically, has to do is say 'no' to most of Joe Biden's proposals,"" conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said on his daily podcast earlier this week. After calling House Speaker's race ""funny,"" Ben Shapiro: ""The stakes for the Speakership of the House are incredibly low at this point because all the leader of the House, basically, has to do is say 'no' to most of Joe Biden's proposals"" pic.twitter.com/bpKNdfmkj4 In short: if Republicans are trying to build a coalition against the Biden administration, they're going to have to do it alone—despite Biden's longstanding reputation as a dealmaker willing to work across the aisle. ""With regards to the fight over the Speaker...that's not my problem,"" Biden told reporters as he left the White House for an appearance in Kentucky Wednesday afternoon. ""I just think it's a little embarrassing that it's taking so long,"" he added. Presidents in recent history rarely involved themselves in the process. Barack Obama—who had a reportedly rocky relationship with former Republican speaker Paul Ryan—remained on the sidelines of his contentious 2015 bid for the post amid the party's then-Republican majority. Looking back, however, there was at least one episode in early U.S. history where a president got intimately involved with the process. In 1834, then-president Andrew Jackson—a former Speaker of the House himself—sought to lobby friendly members of Congress to appoint future president James K. Polk for the post. However, when members of his ""Kitchen Cabinet""—a group of unofficial advisers he'd appointed in a break with his then-Vice President—went to Capitol Hill to lobby on Polk's behalf, many members of Congress, including some in Jackson's own party, perceived the effort as an encroachment upon the constitutional prerogative of the House, leading to a splintering of his party.
